            "content": "Robert Heinlein\u2019s classic short story \u2018All You Zombies\u2019 gets the big screen treatment as the basis for the Science Fiction time travel thriller \u2018Predestination\u2019, a notably imaginative film noir that craftily elevates the genre into an alluring confection. Australian cinematic siblings the Spierig Brothers (as in Michael and Peter) dutifully direct and adapt Heinlein\u2019s Science Fiction material into a twisty tale of search and suspense. It was reported that Heinlein wrote his intriguing narrative in one single day back in the late 1950s. Well, whatever the case is behind such speculation, it is clear that \u2018Predestination\u2019 is a competent and compelling time travel vehicle that deserves its inevitable comparison to the likes of Rian Johnon\u2019s solid and involving 2012 inventive spectacle \u2018Looper\u2019. \r\n\r\nThe Spierig Brothers and \u2018Predestination\u2019 lead Ethan Hawke (Oscar-nominated for \u2018Training Day\u2019 and \u2018Boyhood\u2019) collaborate once again as they bring together a surreal movie experience detailing with the agenda of a Temporal Agent going undercover as a barkeep known as The Bartender (Hawke) in an attempt to thwart criminal activities before they turn into actual crimes. It is worth noting that the Spierigs have coveted the zombies/vampires sensationalism in their earlier films (\u2018Undead\u2019 and \u2018Daybreakers\u2019) but curiously side-swipe any references to these creatures in \u2018Predestination\u2019 despite the aforementioned \u2018All You Zombies\u2019 blueprint for inspiration. Perhaps this is a wise revelation as the Spierigs are allowed to concentrate on the ponderous SF aspects of human adventure within the varied dimensions of time, place and space.\r\n\r\nThe daring exposition gels both creatively and caustically because of the macabre mission being undertaken by the Bartender and feminine targeted scriber \u2018The Unmarried Mother\u2019 (as portrayed by Aussie actress Sarah Snook, \u2018Jessabelle\u2019). The agent Bartender is represented by a shadowy and roguish governmental outfit blessed with the ability to fight crime through time-traveling tactics. Unfortunately, the rough edges in preventing crime-ridden hedonism through time travel accessibility has not always been a smooth transition for the Agency. Also, it does not help that the constant policing corruption has spiraled out of control thus adding more pressure to the Agency to perform its watchdog duties tackling sinister plots.\r\n\r\nThere are revolving elements that shape \u2018Predestination\u2019 to become this enigmatic, head-scratching puzzle where the sense of encountering warped worlds are wondrous yet unsettling and weird. The Bartender (already a victimized and distressed pawn in the nefarious dealings of the id-70s New York City\u2019s elusive and crazed Fizzle Bomber) soon encounters a stranger betting him that he (or \u2018she\u2019 in certain cases) can provide the most outlandish story that he has ever heard to date. Soon the boastful stranger (Snook), a \u2018True Confessions\u2019 columnist for the written piece \u2018The Unmarried Mother\u2019, will figure into the Bartender\u2019s predestined existence in more ways than one.\r\n\r\n\u2018Predestination\u2019 is a complicated SF sideshow that touched upon some unconventional fodder that range from timely commentary pertaining to violence to topical issues of sexuality. The film skillfully presents the frailties of suspicion, apprehension and uncertainty within the tangled and playful web of time travel management. With all the nifty under-sized flashy special effects and Science Fiction trickery aside, \u2018Predestination\u2019 sparkles in large part to its committed and calculating performances by Hawke and Snook as the psychological bait that guides the audience into the transfixing insanity that persists within the confines of the storylines. In particular, Snook\u2019s \u2018Mother\u2019 is called upon to offer a complex characterization of an individual (both female and male genders) and take us into the nostalgic timelines of the past and present while conveying shades of toughness, vulnerability and mystique. She has a sordid backstory that unfolds and adds to the tormented trials and tribulations with the obsession of catching the scheming Fizzle Bomber. In a convincing supporting role, Noah Taylor\u2019s Mr. Robertson is instrumental in the development of Snook\u2019s triple identity crisis as Jane/John/\u2019Mother\u2019.\r\n\r\nThere certainly is an old-fashioned, spellbinding vibe about \u2018Predestination\u2019 that propels the Spierigs\u2019 trippy time-traveling spectacle to its climatic ambitions. The low-key production values are surprisingly engaging but overall the telling proof of acting, directing, writing and imagination seems to be a winning formula in conception. Of course, the other filmmaking strokes involving the crisp cinematography, soothing score and vibrant set designs further compliments this punchy actioner.\r\n\r\nDark, moody and visibly challenging, 'Predestination\u2019 gleefully plots and twists its way into a hearty submission of inspired Science Fiction contemplation. After all, time does not stand still for anybody especially in the realm of Australian noir SF sensibilities.\r\n\r\nPredestination (2014)\r\n\r\nSony Pictures Worldwide Acquisitions\r\n\r\n1 hr.  37 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Ethan Hawke, Sarah Snook and Noah Taylor\r\n\r\nDirected by: Michael and Peter Spierig\r\n\r\nRated: R\r\n\r\nGenre: Science Fiction/Time Travel thriller/Sci-Fi crime caper\r\n\r\nCritic\u2019s rating: *** stars (out of four stars)",

            "content": "The one thing that this job has taught me is that truth is stranger than fiction.\r\n\r\nOut of Australia, Predestination is directed by Michael Spierig and Peter Spierig (who also scores the music). The Spierig's also adapt the screenplay from Robert A. Heinlein's story \"All You Zombies\". It stars Ethan Hawke, Sarah Snook, Noah Taylor, Christopher Kirby and Madeleine West. Ben Nott is the cinematographer. \r\n\r\nIf we throw up a simple synopsis for this pic, it's about a time travelling agent who goes back in time to stop a killer known as \"The Fizzle Bomber\" - whilst helping a trans-gender man who has just told him a fascinating and emotionally wrought story. But simple is not a word readily associated with the Spierig's deliriously complicated mind meld of a movie. \r\n\r\nThe first half of film is the story being relayed by Snook to Hawke, and then the film spirals into a world of temporal loops and frazzled paradoxes. This demands the utmost attention from the viewer, a piece guaranteed to have you asking tricky questions, and also likely to have you rewinding some scenes for clarity - like I did!\r\n\r\nThis is not an actioner, this is very cerebral and sedate in tone, adult science fiction that's as audacious as it is clever. Snook is quite simply outstanding, the various layers she gives to her characterisations grip with intensity and emotional heart tugs. Hawke once again is reassuringly great - in that how he doesn't need to overact, he recognises the tone needed here, whilst knowing it's wise to let his co-star take the main stage.\r\n\r\nThematically the story blends its dizzying thoughts about time and its impact on the human race, with that of our basic human condition, that of identity. This is a very rewarding production for those who wont be popping off to make a cup of coffee during the viewing, it's hoped that in time this will garner more fans and be seen as something of a sci-fi gem. 8/10",

      "synopsis": "The film begins with a temporal agent attempting to apprehend an infamous terrorist known as the 'Fizzle Bomber', who planted a bomb in a building attempting to kill hundreds of people. The agent succeeds in containing the bomb but is severely injured when his face is partially exposed to the resulting explosion. The Fizzle Bomber manages to escape and the temporal agent returns to his timeline (in the future) using a coordinate transformer field kit (a time machine) with the help of an unknown person. Returning to the future, in 1992, the agent awakens to find that he has undergone facial surgery to save his life. Doctors grafted on new skin and reconstructed the agent's face and throat as they were badly damaged. It is revealed during this time that the agent works for a mysterious organization, known as the Temporal Bureau, that sends temporal agents through time to prevent major crimes that would cost the lives of thousands of people and that the Fizzle Bomber is the only criminal to elude them thus far; the Fizzle Bomber is also responsible for killing 11,000 people in New York in 1975. Once the agent is healed, he is ordered to embark on a final mission before he is decommissioned from the agency. The agent accepts the mission, uses his coordinate transformer field kit (which is disguised as a violin case) to travel back in time to 1978, and works as a bartender in New York. The bartender seemingly awaits the arrival of a particular customer who he starts chatting with. This customer, a man, is referred to as the 'Unmarried Mother' since he writes confession magazines, many of them presumably from the point of view of an unmarried mother. The Unmarried Mother and bartender start talking and the Unmarried Mother wagers a bottle of liquor if his story is enough to shock or surprise the bartender. The bartender agrees and the Unmarried Mother tells the bartender of his past. The Unmarried Mother explains that he was originally a girl and was taken into an orphanage on September 13, 1945, when she was left at the orphanage doorstep. She was named 'Jane' by one of the workers at the orphanage. The Unmarried Mother recounts events in his life when he was a girl, saying that he envied children with parents and felt he was different somehow. He also states that he was quite gifted and was very good in all scientific fields and was physically strong, being able to fight boys. The Unmarried Mother tells the bartender that she wanted to join the space corps to help and service astronauts in space as she wanted to go to outer space herself and enlisted. Jane excelled in all the tests set for her by the space corps, but she was disqualified during the selection process as doctors found a medical anomaly during her physical, revealing that Jane has an inter-sex condition were he/she has two sets of sex organs: male and female. The doctors do not tell Jane this, however, and she tries to move on with her life. Jane eventually goes to night classes in Cleveland to work on her demeanor and charm, but accidentally stumbles into a stranger on her way home on April 3, 1963. The two begin talking and soon start a relationship together. The Unmarried Mother tells the bartender that the two fell in love and that she believed she had met the only person who she truly cared about, but eventually the stranger left Jane and never came back. Emotionally distraught, Jane is approached by Mr. Robertson, thought to be one of the recruiting officers at the space corps, who tells Jane that he actually works for a different organization that could use someone with her intelligence and physical abilities and offers her a chance to join. Jane is about to accept his proposition, but falls pregnant from when she was with the stranger. Jane eventually gives birth to a baby girl, but a C-section is required to successfully remove the baby. One of the doctors whoim performed the operation then tells Jane that during the operation they had to surgically remove her uterus and ovaries, but since they found male sex organs intact, they surgically reconstructed Jane into a man. Jane's child is kidnapped by an unknown man. Jane is completely reconstructed into a man with further operations. The Unmarried Mother explains that as life went on, he became a writer and started writing confession stories under the pen name 'The Unmarried Mother'. The Unmarried Mother concludes the story and asks if he has earned the bottle of liquor. The bartender almost gives him the bottle, but quickly reveals that he knows the Unmarried Mother's new male name which is 'John' and other details in John/Jane's life. John eventually follows the bartender into a secure basement underneath the bar. The bartender tells John that he actually works for Mr. Robertson, and that the organization Mr. Robertson was referring to was the Temporal Bureau. The bartender then offers John the chance to kill the man who ruined \"his\" life, with no repercussions as long as he agrees to be recruited into the Temporal Bureau afterwards. John accepts and they travel back in time to April 3, 1963, in Cleveland, Ohio. The bartender arms John with a gun to confront the man who seduced, impregnated, and abandoned Jane, telling him exactly where and when to find him. John is directed to Cleveland College, but when he gets there he accidentally meets Jane, his younger female self, while the bartender/temporal agent looks on from a distance and eventually uses his time machine to travel into the future. The agent ends up in the exact same building in New York in the beginning of the film, only he arrives a few minutes earlier than his former self to stop the Fizzle Bomber. He spots the Fizzle Bomber and fights him, but is incapacitated in the ensuing fight. He then wakes to the sound of an explosion and gunfire and realizes that his former self (from the beginning of the movie) has been injured and he wasn't able to stop the bomber. He is revealed to be the man who helps his former self reach his time machine in order to get back to the Temporal Bureau in 1985. The temporal agent uses his time machine to travel back to March 1964 where he meets with Robertson. The agent managed to grab some evidence from the bomb used by the Fizzle Bomber and hands it over to Robertson. It is shown that Robertson and the agent are actually having their conversation in the hospital ward where Jane's child is born. The temporal agent/bartender then kidnaps the child and takes the baby girl back in time to the same orphanage that Jane grew up in, in 1945. The temporal agent soon returns to 1963 to retrieve John and reveals to him his mission and why he set John and Jane together. The temporal agent explains that he, John, Jane and the child are all the same person that exist through a predestined time paradox. He tells John that he needed John to meet with Jane in order for her to become pregnant and give birth to a child who would eventually grow up to be them. If the temporal agent had not kidnapped the child and transported her back to 1945, or if he had not set up John and Jane, none of them would exist. John states that he doesn't want to leave Jane, but the temporal agent insists it has to be. The temporal agent takes the Unmarried Mother, John, to the Temporal Bureau in 1985, to ensure his own existence so that he could prevent the crimes to come, and is decommissioned. Robertson also gives the temporal agent a file containing new leads recovered from the evidence he gave Robertson. The temporal agent/bartender/future John, then returns to his own timeline to live out a normal life as best he can in 1975 New York. He then deactivates his time machine, but it encounters an error and does not deactivate properly. The agent/future John soon deduces where to find the bomber using the leads given to him by Robertson. The agent eventually finds the bomber in a laundromat store. To the agent's shock he sees that the Fizzle Bomber is actually him in the future. The Fizzle bomber states that he saved more lives than he has taken as a result of his actions and that Robertson is setting them up. The Fizzle Bomber, seemingly insane, says that if the agent kills him the agent will become him as it is a repetitive cycle, but if the agent loves him again when he was Jane and John, then they can break the cycle. Disgusted with his future self, the agent decides to kill the Fizzle Bomber. The movie ends with the agent overlooking the time machine stating that he knows for sure that Jane, John and himself were the best things that have happened to him in his life and that he misses his past selves dreadfully.",

         "I feel like sometimes great movies don't get enough recognition, films like Prisoners, Enemy, or Predestination. This film impacted me heavily, and it kept me thinking and thinking about it for a week after I saw it. Ethan Hawke gave a great performance, which keeps me wondering why he ever agreed to do \"The Purge\", but the real standout is Sarah Snook, who is breathtaking in her role. One of the best things about this film was that when I thought it was going in one direction, it took a hard right hand turn. Not many movies make me doubt myself like that. The direction was clean and solid, the cinematography was immaculate, and the special and visual effects were outstanding. Everything about the look of the film was perfect. My only complaints are that the movie's first act was a little slow. However, as the film progresses into the second and third act, the long first act is absolutely necessary. If it was a little shorter, it would've worked so well. Confusing? Yes. Enjoyable? Big time. If you can see Predestination, definitely do so. 8/10",
         "Sadly I had to travel to an old and tiny cinema to see this movie as it didn't play in the major cinemas on the Gold Coast...after watching this movie i have absolutely no clue why. I truly enjoyed every minute of this film, all of the actors did a great job, especially Ethan Hawk. I did see some of the plot lines coming and still got a bit of a surprise in how they delivered those plot lines...if you get a chance and like a sci-fi with brains then go and watch this!!! I would definitely not compare it to looper (just to add to the end) yes looper and predestination are about time travel, but thats were it ends... :)",
         "This is not just classic sci-fi it is almost a classic Greek play: Fateful and tragic. That's the parting feeling. But it delivers so many genres on any level you care to enjoy it. To me the strength of this film is the characters�every day people like ourselves�seeing themselves in an extraordinary light. As time-travel stories go there are none of the paradoxes of other such films to frustrate you. The elegant, thought-provoking symmetry of the original short story is respected beautifully�but hats off to the directors for expanding it into a study of human self-identity. In my opinion the best sci-fi only uses fantasy (within the realms of possibility) to explore humanity in ways that a grounding in known reality cannot, and this film offers viewers a 'what if' so believably presented they can put themselves in that situation and question themselves in a way they normally never would. The only paradox here is the very real inescapable self of all of us and yet being so many different people throughout our lives. You will benefit from seeing this film.",
         "\"Predestination\" is an incredibly original and creative film, employing what may seem like 'common' aspects of the science-fiction genre, and putting a darker, grimmer twist on them. Time travel is handled quite well in this Australian film, focusing less on the effects of travelling back (and forth) in time than other sci-fi films. \"Predestination\" uses decidedly odd pacing, beginning with a 'bang' and following that up with almost an hour of subdued plot. But oddly enough, these moments of -almost- pure dialogue and occasional flashbacks never become boring, but rather deepen the film's characters and their back-stories. The cast performances are what really make this movie 'shine'. Ethan Hawke, as usual, delivers an almost flawless performance as the unnamed lead, and Sarah Snook, an Australian newcomer, surprises with her wide range of acting abilities. Overall, the third feature film by the Spierig Brothers is a surprisingly original, daring, and genre-bending film.",
         "A must watch for anyone who enjoys a mind bending, soul imploding film. Although the first scene is action packed, not much is understood as to the who's and why's. After that, and for only a few minutes, the movie seemed slow and without direction. Soon after it becomes intriguing, suspenseful, and where the direction of the film is going (although not yet understood). The Director was able to clearly explain the unexplainable at the very end of the movie. So, for those that sometimes walk out of a movie not understanding what happened, I can assure you that will not be the case here. I give many kudos to the original writing, screen writing, directing, and acting. This movie will be ranked as one of my all time best films ever.",
         "Brilliant. Thought-provoking mind bending brilliance. Coming under the radar and screening on Tuesday night as part of the Toronto After Dark Film Festival schedule, Predestination stars Ethan Hawke (Sinister) in a film that caught us off guard and sent us home with the reality of just witnessing one of the best films of the year. Ethan Hawke plays a character without name who is a time-travelling agent for a secret agency that uses their ability to transport to specific dates as an opportunity to stop crime. Hawkes character (known as The Bartender) is on the tail end of his career. And on his final assignment, he is tasked with stopping the \"Fizzle Bomber\", a terrorist that exploded a bomb in New York City in 1975 that killed over 11,000 citizens. The bartender had a chance to stop the bomber once before but failed and now after a recuperating after his final jump, he jumps from 1960's through the 70's, 80's and 90's to achieve his final objective. The time travel machine used to jump is basic and brilliant in its simplicity � a violin case where the adjustment of the numbered and lettered locking mechanism determines the date to which one will travel. It is during an early jump that Hawkes character finds himself in the 1960's acting as a bartender in a small dive bar. It's here where he meets the character played by Sarah Snook (again, no name is given for the character just the description \"The Unmarried Mother\"). The two main characters begin a conversation that is part Tarantino part Mamet in its delivery and genius. The Unmarried Mother begins to weave a tale so unbelievable that it's mesmerizing to hear it unravel. The bartender does not seem as overly surprised at the details and at the conclusion of the anguishing story, he offers the Unmarried Mother an opportunity to go back in time to face the person which caused her such grief. The time jump of the two characters sets the timeline path for a story that goes in directions that will be completely unseen. By the time the Unmarried Mother meets her oppressor and the Bartender confronts the Fizzle Bomber the directing duo of the of Spierig Brothers (Peter and Michael) have laid out a complex plot of intersecting stories best described as a \"snake eating its own tail.\" Ethan Hawke has worked with the Spierig Brothers before with 2009's Daybreakers which this reviewer thought was a well above average tale of vampires in a futuristic world. But with Predestination the collaborative efforts of the brothers and Hawke have created a brilliant time travel science fiction film that betters Rian Johnson's Looper in its vision and execution. Predestination is a movie where washroom breaks are not recommended. Every detail of the story circles back to the wonderful final reveal. It's a film that commands attention and then rewards the viewer for the courtesy. When the year finally comes to a close, we will have screened over 200 films released in 2014. Predestination is sure to be on our list of Top 10 when the tallies are constructed. www.killerreviews.com",
         "it's been a while since i've been this satisfied with a movie, it's compelling, thought provoking and extremely clever film that keeps you guessing to the last frame. excellent storytelling thanks for the great work from the directors/writers despite the low budget they pulled out a great movie with good production values, sets, costumes and special effects. powerhouse performances from the two leads Ethan Hawke as usual is a very serious actor though he haven't been in any good movies in the past few years but you can see that he's making a comeback with this one as well as this years magnificent BOYHOOD but his performance in PREDESTINATION is a very strong one because he had to handle such a very complicated character, same thing goes for Sarah Snook. the less i say about the plot the better, this is the kind of movies where you have focus throughout the whole runtime of it trying to figure out where is it going and any detail that you miss might ruin the whole experience for you but hey don't worry there's an explanation for everything here. this movie is one of this years' personal favorites as well as the indie of the year so far (still have to see BIRDMAN).",
         "Interesting and captivating with a new twist to the classic formula. Great cinematography and excellent acting contribute to this refreshing Sci-Fi/Time Travel film. Rising actress Sarah Snook with a stellar performance is backed by solid performances of both Hawke and Taylor. Such movies usually suffer from failed attempts at originality and complexity boarding on confusion. This movie avoids both by not trying to surprise and shock the viewer but rather act more as a mystery novel - unfolding with precision, letting the viewers participate in the events and discoveries to come. Much like a good old Agatha Christie book would successfully do. The Spierig brothers keep getting better with each movie and this is a great step forward in what seems to be a promising career. There is nothing new under the Time Travel sun but the delivery is excellent which makes this movie worth watching - at least twice, as any good Time Travel movie requires.",
         "Twisty, turny and mind-bending, one viewing won't be enough for this time travelling head scratcher. Two plots � one revolving around Ethan Hawke's temporal agent seeking to stop a terrorist, the other following the life of a precocious orphan who isn't quite like everybody else � are intricately and intelligently woven together to not only build tension but to explore provocative themes to spoiler-y to mention here. In fact, Predestination is one of those movies its hard to say much of anything about. It's such a meticulously drip-fed thriller � slowly and superbly unravelling as each and every minute of the runtime ticks on � that the real joy here is unwrapping and grasping (or attempting to any rate) what it is you're actually witnessing. In his second collaboration with Aussie filmmakers the Spierig Brothers, Hawke is in career-best form as the veteran time traveller on the brink of burning out, whilst relative newcomer Sarah Snook (born and bred South Australian) is outstanding in a complex and demanding role that has rightly grabbed the attention of Hollywood. The Spierig's also demonstrate their diversity in both the writing and directing departments, going from the enjoyable but tonally lightweight splatter-fest Daybreakers to this altogether more mature, thematically heavy and narratively elaborate sci-fi saga that still manages to maintain a high excitement level. This year's Looper or Inception.",
         "Anyone who loves mindfuck movies and movies incredibly hard to understand at the end, will love this one. The beginning seems kinda weird, and what the director does with the beginning is planting a seed of thought into the minds of the viewers, i bet you 10 people will have 10 different outcomes thought through while watching the movie from the start. The plot twists and the originality of the movie were fantastic, haven't seen anything quite like that in a movie. The fact that all the movies main characters, except Robinson is the same person is hard to believe and extremely well thougth through and displayed for the viewers. Were else have you seen a movie which can lead to you having sex with you, giving birth to you, then bringing yourself back to 1963 to break up the relationship between yourself and yourself and taking yourself as a baby back in time and toping it all by killing yourself? Awesome plot, great idea and something very original and amusing."
