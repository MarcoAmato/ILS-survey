Smart plot with a great background topic talking about the differences, stereotypes, prejudices and joining the tendency of giving women more important roles.\r\n\r\nIt has still several gaps to fill and enhance on the latest point but it is, IMHO, a milestone in the right direction.\r\n\r\nThe characters work pretty well and it is funny when needed and not too full of cheesy songs.",

            "content": "> Try everything (but differently). So Disney has done it again.\r\n\r\nThis beautiful animation came to exist because of coming together of the directors of 'Tangled' and 'Wreck-it-Ralp'. It is Disney who had once again done it, since their rival Pixer is going down in a rapid speed. As a Disney fan since my childhood, I'm very happy for their success in live-shot films and animations, especially for this one.\r\n\r\nOkay, since the revolution of 3D animation over 20 years ago after overthrowing the 2D animation, most of the big productions like Disney, Pixer and Dreamworks with few others never failed to deliver. Believe me, I was not interested in this film when I first saw the teaser and trailer. But they have done great promotions and so the film did awesomely at screens worldwide. I was totally blown away after seeing it, Disney's another unique universal charactered story. From the little children to the grown ups, everybody definitely going to enjoy it.\r\n\r\nAll kinds of animals coming together happens only in cinemas, and that too mostly in animations. But todays kids are very sharp who ask lots of questions, so they had a fine explanation for the doubts regarding putting animals in a same society. It was like the United States, where everyone came from different continents and represents different race. And so in this film every animal came from different land to live together peacefully in a city called Zootopia.\r\n\r\nSo the story begins when Judy the rabbit follows her dream to become a police officer in Zootopia. There she meets Nick the fox, who are actually arch-rival species in the wild, but it was thousands of years ago before adapting the civilisation. So trust is what not promised between them, but they're forced to work together after a small missing person case becomes their prime agenda. Solving the mystery is what brings the end to this wonderful tale.\r\n\r\nThese days animations are not just concentrated on comedies, trying to get us emotionally as well. Maybe that's how they're grabbing the adult audience, especially the families. Shakira's cameo was the highlight, and her song 'Try Everything' helped the get attention from all the corners.\r\n\r\nThe Oscars was concluded just a couple of months ago, but it already feels like the fever is gripping again for the next edition and looks like this film is leading the way for the animation category. I know it's too early, but I hope it wins it. And finally a request for the Disney, bring it on a sequel as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n8/10",

            "content": "Zootopia is the latest family animation movie from Disney about a young bunny determined to be a cop at all costs  \u2013 in a land where only 'predators' are cops, she would be the first \u2018prey\u2019 cop. Seriously? Anyway, she puts on the hard work and makes it to the land where anything is possible.\r\n\r\nZootopia makes some good real life comparisons: Zootopia itself seems to look like New York, even including a hustle by a sly fox.  Racism seems to be ever present in both color and speech. But the best thing about Zootopia is Judy\u2019s positive attitude and relentless determination to succeed.\r\n\r\nThe animation is as good as a Pixar animation \u2013 perfectly made  \u2013 and the story is well told, full of action scenes and funny moments. Kids will definitely love this one and grown up kids will enjoy the deep thought provoking tones set in this movie. \r\n\r\nThe best performance in this movie arguably comes from Police Chief Bogo whose voice is played by Idris Elba. His performance should earn him an Oscar this year! No wonder it has grossed 1 Billion dollars worldwide despite little marketing. \r\n\r\nRated 9 out of 10 only because we cannot give it a 10.",

            "content": "This is a really, really good animated family movie. It is a perfect blend of funny characters, decent story and little jokes spread around in the animation.\r\n\r\nAlmost all characters are very likable and funny, each in a different way. The actual story has quite a bit of suspense (for an animated family film) while still being sufficiently light and funny. Actually it is kind of two stories. One is the story of Judy Hopps fighting to prove herself as a police officer and the other is the more sinister evil plot that she attempts to unravel.\r\n\r\nThe movie moves at a good enough speed leaving enough room to both tell the story itself and inserting jokes and comical situations. The two bureaucratic sloths were quite fun already in their first scenes but the last scene with them at the very end of the movie was absolutely hilarious.\r\n\r\nThe animation itself was certainly adequate although I sometimes miss the old hand drawn animations from Walt Disney.\r\n\r\nOverall, one of the better, if not the best, animated movie I have watched in quite a while.",

            "content": "This film is named 'Zootopia' in the US but the title was changed when it was shown in the UK. I thought it is a very good children's film. Very well animated. Colourful. Really cute animals.\r\n\r\nIt is a great parable about tolerance and racism which could be seen as a mirror to the xenophobia in society today. The story is of a rabbit called Judy Hopps who overcomes diversity to become a police officer in the city of Zootropolis (Zootopia). This is a very tough city full of crime and only strong predators take charge. Judy must help to solve the case of predators disappearing around the city but needs to fight her colleagues' prejudices at the same time.\r\n\r\nThe jokes are funny and the story is intriguing. The film contains lots of references to other films which will keep viewers of all ages happy (including a very funny Breaking Bad spoof).\r\nThe voice acting is very good and each actor perfectly adds to their character.\r\n\r\n★★★★",

      "synopsis": "In the town of Bunnyburrow, 9 year old bunny, Judy Hopps (Della Saba) is performing in a school play. Her theme explains that animals, once primitive and wild, have now evolved to where predators and prey can live side by side in harmony. The founding mammal city, Zootopia, is hailed as a place where anyone can be anything. Judy then announces that she wants to be a police officer. A kid fox in the audience, Gideon Grey (Phil Johnston), sneers at the idea and even Judy's parents, Bonnie and Stu (Bonnie Hunt and Don Lake) tell her that there's never been a bunny officer. However, Judy is willing to try against all odds. When Judy sees Gideon bullying some kids by taking their fair tickets she boldly confronts him, but Gideon responds by taunting Judy's dreams and slashing her in the face. He leaves and, though she's hurt, Judy shows her friends the tickets she got back and declares that she doesn't know when to quit. Years later Judy attends the Zootopia Police Academy. Judy is tiny compared to the other recruits and faces difficulties managing the obstacle courses run by the drill sergeant (Fuschia!). But through sheer determination, and by using her wits, Judy makes it to graduation as valedictorian. Zootopia Mayor Lionheart (J.K. Simmons) oversees the ceremony and Assistant Mayor Bellwether (Jenny Slate), a sheep, formally congratulates Judy as the first bunny police officer, saying it's a big day for all small animals. She is assigned to Precinct 1 in the heart of Zootopia, much to the apprehension of her parents. A few days after, Judy, her parents, and many siblings head to the train station. Stu convinces Judy to take a can of fox repellent with her before she gets on the train to Zootopia. Judy listens to a hit by pop singer, Gazelle (Shakira), as she zooms through the diverse districts of the city, from the frozen tundra to the sultry rainforest. She finds her apartment, a run-down single room with a rickety bed, paper-thin walls, and two noisy neighbors, Bucky and Pronk Oryx-Antlerson (Byron Howard and Jared Bush). Despite this, she's all to excited for her first day. She gets up bright and early and makes it to the police station where she is directed to role call by the pudgy desk sergeant, a cheetah named Benjamin Clawhauser (Nate Torrence). All the other officers (elephants, rhinos, hippos, and bears) tower over Judy. Police Chief Bogo (Idris Elba) calls them to order and explains their first priority is handling the case of fourteen missing animals; all predators. Bogo divides everyone into teams but assigns Judy to parking duty. Judy is disappointed but sets her standards high and uses her sharp ears to help her write 200 tickets before noon. Around then, she notices a fox who appears to be up to something enter a local ice cream shop run by Jerry Jumbeaux Jr. (John DiMaggio). Though suspicious at first, Judy then sees the fox, Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman), is just trying to purchase a jumbo-pop for his son who is wearing an elephant costume. Jerry refuses service to the fox with sneering bigotry and this angers Judy who steps in and proposes a compromise; she'll let the elephants off with a warning for the health code violation of serving ice cream without gloves on their trunks if Nick can have a jumbo-pop. When Nick confesses he doesn't have his wallet, and apologizes to his son for the worst birthday, Judy goes further and pays for the treat. She tells Nick she can't stand it when people are mistreated for being predators or prey and walks away with a spring in her step, happy to have helped someone in need. Later that day, Judy is writing more tickets when she notices the little fox in his elephant suit. She approaches to say hello but then notices that he and Nick are melting the jumbo-pop from the roof of a building and letting the drippings collect in large jars. They drive away together, with the little fox at the wheel. Judy follows them into Tundratown and sees them making mini pops with the melted juice. They take them into the Savannah District and sell them to hamsters coming out of work. The hamsters chomp on the pops and leave the sticks in a recycling bin. The little fox collects the sticks and he and Nick take them to a construction zone in Little Rodentia where they're sold as lumber. Later, Nick and his 'son', a full-grown fennec fox named Finnick (Tommy 'Tiny' Lister), part ways and Judy confronts Nick. Nick doesn't deny that he's a hustler but provides Judy with all the paperwork he needs to make his endeavors technically legal and humbles her by saying that the city is not a magical land where dreams come true and a meter maid can never be a real cop. Judy returns to her apartment, sullen, and bears through a call from her parents who are relieved to see she has the safest job on the force. The next day, Judy is writing more tickets for less than enthused citizens when she is approached by a frantic pig (Josh Dallas) who tells her he's just been robbed. Judy springs into action and chases the thieving weasel (Alan Tudyk) through the city square and into Little Rodentia. During the chase, he kicks a plastic doughnut from a shop toward Judy and it nearly crushes a lady shrew, but Judy stops it in the nick of time and uses the doughnut to apprehend the weasel. Judy rolls him into the station but is called to Bogo's office. He reprimands her for leaving her post to retrieve a bag of moldy onions. Judy objects, saying that the 'onions' are actually flower bulbs called Midnicampum holicithias and that she only wanted to serve as a real cop. Just then, an otter named Mrs. Otterton (Octavia Spencer) barges in, begging Chief Bogo to find her husband, Emmitt, who has been missing for ten days. Bogo offers empty assurances until Judy steps up and promises to find him. Bogo escorts Mrs. Otterton out of the office before firing Judy for insubordination. However, when he opens the door again, he finds Mrs. Otterton speaking with Assistant Mayor Bellwether who promptly sends a notice to the mayor about Judy's willingness to take the case and tells Judy to come to her for any assistance. Bogo reluctantly allows Judy to take the case but gives her a 48 hour ultimatum; she finds the otter or resigns. Judy agrees. At the front desk, Clawhauser gives Judy the case file but there are no leads or witnesses and, since she's new, she has no technological resources. However, Judy notices in the lone photograph they have that Emmitt is eating a familiar looking popsicle. She locates Nick on the streets and demands his help but he refuses. When she says his ten dollars' worth of mini pops can wait, he claims to have made two hundred a day since he was twelve. Judy records Nick on her carrot pen recorder and puts his own words against his tax files which show he's claimed zero income. Judy says she'll report him for tax evasion, a federal offense, unless he helps her. Finnick, who was asleep in the stroller Nick was pushing, laughs at the reverse hustle and wishes Nick good luck working with the fuzz before walking off. Nick takes Judy to Mystic Springs Oasis, the last place he saw Otterton going. They're met by a yak named Yax (Tommy Chong), doing yoga behind a desk. He recognizes Mr. Otterton but says he hasn't seen him in a couple of weeks. He then takes them into the oasis to find Emmitt's yoga instructor, an elephant named Nangi (Gita Reddy), and Judy is shocked to find the oasis is a haven for naturalists; nude animals. Nangi has no memory of Otterton, but Yax unwittingly gives Judy all the information she needs, including the plate number for the car Otterton was picked up in the last time he was there. Nick says he has a friend at the DMV who can help them run the plate number. There, Judy is disheartened to see that the DMV is run solely by sloths. Nick's friend, Flash (Raymond S. Persi) is able to run the plate number for them but, naturally, takes forever to do so. This isn't helped when Nick, in an attempt to push Judy's buttons, delays them with a joke. By the time they exit, it's nighttime. Judy finds out the car in question is a limo in Tundratown but, by the time she and Nick arrive, the lot's closed. Without a warrant, Judy cannot get in. Defeated, she holds out her recording pen to Nick but flings it over the fence. Nick goes to retrieve it and Judy meets him on the other side, slyly saying that she doesn't need a warrant if she has probable cause - and a shifty-looking fox climbing over the gate qualifies. They locate the limo and search it, finding polar bear fur, claw marks all over the back seat, and Otterton's wallet. Then, Nick recognizes an insignia on a drinking glass and panics; he knows who's car this is. When they open the car door to leave they're confronted by a couple of polar bears who shove them into a car. Squeezed in the back seat between two polar bears, Nick explains that the car belongs to a thug boss named Mr. Big with whom he's not on good terms because Nick sold him an expensive rug made from the fur of a skunk's butt. Nick and Judy are brought into a study where Mr. Big (Maurice LaMarche), a shrew, is carried in by his polar bear guards. He berates Nick for tarnishing his trust and the hospitality of his grandmother who he recently buried in the skunk rug, and scolds him for returning on the day of his daughter's wedding. Unafraid, Judy steps forward and tells Mr. Big that she knows Emmitt Otterton was with him last and will find out what happened to him if it's the last thing she does. Unfazed, Mr. Big orders his bears to 'ice' Nick and Judy and they're held over a trap door in the floor that reveals icy water. Mr. Big's daughter, Fru Fru (Leah Latham), then walks in wearing her wedding dress and recognizes Judy as the bunny that saved her the previous day from being crushed by the doughnut. In gratitude, Mr. Big releases Judy and Nick and invites them to Fru Fru's wedding reception where he explains that Otterton was his florist but, before meeting with him to discuss something important, went crazy in the limo he sent, attacked his driver, and disappeared. Mr. Big directs them to speak with the driver, Manchas (Jesse Corti), in the Rainforest District for more information. Manchas, a melanistic jaguar, cracks open the door when Nick and Judy arrive, showing scratches all over his face and acting fearful. He tells them that Otterton kept talking about the 'night howlers' before he went wild and savagely attacked him. Nick says they're there to talk about the night howlers too and Manchas agrees to let them in but, just after he unlocks the chain, Judy and Nick hear him groan followed by a thud. They push the door open to see Manchas on all fours, growling viciously at them. Nick and Judy run for their lives, pursued closely by Manchas. Judy manages to call for backup as she and Nick tumble and fall through the slick canopy. Finally, Judy is able to cuff Manchas to a light pole near a gondola station and throws herself and Nick off it into some vines away from the jaguar's claws. They meet up with the responding police units and Judy explains to Chief Bogo that she believes Manchas, like Otterton, went 'savage'. However, when she takes them back to the gondola station, Manchas is gone. Bogo, irritated and not believing Judy's story demands her to hand over her badge for failing to complete her assignment, but Nick stands up for Judy. He says that Bogo gave them 48 hours, which means they have ten left to find Otterton. He takes Judy onto a gondola and they leave. Over the rainforest, Nick explains that he was idealistic like Judy once. As a kid, he wanted nothing more than to join the Junior Ranger Scouts. His mother bought him a new uniform and he was excited to become part of the group, despite the fact that he was the only predator to join. Upon arriving, however, the other animals bullied and muzzled him, saying that he was stupid for thinking they'd trust a fox. After that day he decided he would never let anyone see that they had gotten to him and if people only thought of foxes as shifty and untrustworthy, then that's what he would be. Judy consoles him but Nick deflects from her affections by looking at traffic below. He then realizes that there are traffic cameras all over the canopy and they can use them to find out where Manchas was taken. Judy recalls that Assistant Mayor Bellwether offered to help them. They meet her at City Hall and she takes them to her office which is nothing more than a janitor's closet. Despite her upbeat personality, it's no secret that she's woefully mistreated by the Mayor. She opens the database for the Rainforest District traffic cameras before being called away by Lionheart. Judy and Nick find the footage of Manchas and see that he was netted and hauled away by timber wolves. Judy realizes that the wolves must be the Night Howlers. They watch as the wolves' van drives through a tunnel but fails to come out the other side. Nick says that there's a maintenance tunnel and, if he were to do anything illegal, that's the route he'd take to avoid observation. They relocate the van and go to where it was headed - an old building outside of town called Cliffside Asylum. Nick and Judy make it past the guards by inciting a group howl; something the wolves can't resist. Inside, they find new equipment in an old hospital ward. Following claw marks on the floor, they find fifteen cells inhabited by various predators, all feral and savage, including Manchas and Mr. Otterton. Judy realizes she's just found all of the missing mammals but, just then, Mayor Lionheart enters with a badger doctor (Katie Lowes). Judy and Nick hide in an empty cell and Judy records Lionheart as he demands to know why predators are going savage. The doctor has no answer and says that they must come forward to Chief Bogo but the Mayor refuses, saying his reputation as a predator official is at stake. At that moment, Judy's phone rings with a call from her parents. Lionheart is startled and the doctor orders security to investigate before locking off the wing. Nick and Judy escape by flushing themselves down a toilet just before the guards arrive and they manage to get the evidence Judy recorded back to Bogo. The ZPD arrive at the asylum and place everyone, including the Mayor, under arrest. Lionheart contests that they still don't know why predators are going savage and he was trying to protect the public. Later, Chief Bogo holds a press conference where Judy gives Nick her pen recorder and offers him the chance to sign up as her partner. Nick is flattered and watches as Judy is called to the stand to answer some questions. Judy starts simple, mentioning that all the savage mammals are predators, but when pressed as to why, she speculates that it could be something to do with their DNA. As predators, the inflicted may have reverted back to their primal origins. The reporters go into a frenzy before Bellwether shuts down the conference. Judy is relieved to be off the podium but Nick is angered by what she said. Judy says she was just stating facts but Nick asks her if a fox such as himself should indeed be trusted. When he raises his arms, asking if Judy is afraid of him, she instinctively puts her hand on her fox repellent. He hands her back the application, telling her that it's best she doesn't have a predator for a partner, before leaving. A wedge is driven between the predator and prey populations, with prey acting fearful against all predators. Gazelle hosts a peaceful protest against discrimination, despite backlash, and savage attacks continue in the city as more predators go primal. Judy feels responsible for the ensuing tensions between the animals and goes to see Mrs. Otterton where she's watching Emmitt meander mindlessly in his hospital room. At the police station, Judy is summoned by Bogo to see the new mayor, Bellwether. Bellwether explains that with the population in Zootopia being 90% prey, she wants Judy as the face of the ZPD to inspire hope. But Judy claims that she's no hero and says she's done the opposite of what she wanted; to make the world a better place. She says a good cop should help the city, not tear it apart, and hands over her badge before leaving. Judy returns to Bunnyburrow where she manages her parent's vegetable stand. She wonders aloud to them how she ever thought she could make a difference but they console her as a pie truck pulls up. As the driver, a grown Gideon Grey, gets out, Judy's parents explain that they've partnered up with him and never would have done so had Judy not opened their eyes. Gideon apologizes to Judy for what he did when he was younger, stating that his own insecurities manifested into unchecked rage, but Judy forgives him and says she knows a thing or two about being a jerk. Just then, some bunny children run through the field behind them and Judy's father warns them to stay away from the growing Midnicampum holicithias near the edge. Gideon laughs and says his family just called them night howlers. Judy perks up at this and her father explains that the flowers keep away pests but are toxic. His brother Terry ate one and went into a rage, biting Judy's mother. Judy realizes that the night howlers weren't the wolves - they were flowers. Not only that, but they make animals go savage. She grabs the keys to the truck and races back to Zootopia. She finds Finnick and he points her to Nick, sitting in the sun beside a small bridge. Judy runs up to him and reveals the truth about the night howlers but he walks away. Desperate, Judy apologizes to him and says she needs his help. She begins to cry and admits that she was a jerk to him and really is a dumb bunny as he once said. Nick doesn't seem to react until he replays a recording of her repentance and holds up her pen recorder enabling that and smiles, saying he'll erase it after 48 hours, before embracing a profoundly relieved Judy. They climb into the truck and Nick helps himself to some of Judy's blueberries while she shows him a picture of the weasel thief she caught stealing the Midnicampum holicithias; Duke Weaselton. They find him on a street corner selling bootleg DVDs such as 'Wrangled', 'Pig Hero 6', and 'Meowana'. Judy confronts him and demands to know what he was doing with the night howler flower bulbs, but he says he won't talk. Judy and Nick smile slyly and take the weasel to Mr. Big. Duke is incredulous as to why Mr. Big would help a cop, but Mr. Big smiles and says Judy is the godmother of his future grandchild. A very pregnant Fru Fru says she's going to name her daughter after Judy. On threat of being iced, Duke relents and confesses he sold bulbs to a ram named Doug who works out of an abandoned rail station. Nick and Judy follow the directions to a rusty subway car underground. They sneak inside and find Doug (Rich Moore) in a yellow jumpsuit preparing the blue flowers and harvesting them chemically to produce a serum which he puts into fragile pellets. He loads a pellet into a gun as his phone rings, telling him his next mark is a cheetah in Sahara Square. He assures the caller he can make the hit since he was able to get an otter in a moving car. He places the gun in a briefcase and goes to answer a knock at the back of the car, saying that Woolter and Jesse have come back with coffee. Judy takes the opportunity to knock Doug out of the car and locks the door before ordering Nick to get the car moving. With some finagling, they're able to start it and the car moves down the track, slowly gaining speed. Judy is intent on bringing the evidence to police headquarters but two rams jump onto the moving car. They manage to knock Jesse off the car inside the tunnel, grazing him as he hugs the wall and shaving his belly pink. Woolter head-butts his way into the front of the car as they make their way outside but they soon face another oncoming train. Judy tells Nick to speed up and kicks Woolter into a switch lever just in time, but they are traveling too fast around the next curve and the car derails into the next empty station. Judy and Nick jump from the car as the friction causes it to go up in flames and watch from the platform as it explodes. Judy thinks all the evidence is destroyed but Nick holds up the briefcase with the gun inside. They run upstairs out of the station and into the Natural History Museum, empty due to renovations. As they near the exit toward the police station they are called from behind by Mayor Bellwether, accompanied by two rams in police uniform. Bellwether thanks Judy for discovering the perpetrators behind the predator conspiracy and reaches for the briefcase but Judy wonders aloud how she knew where to find them. They edge toward the exit but are blocked by a disheveled Woolter. Realizing Bellwether was behind the plot all along, Judy and Nick run and attempt to hide down a corridor. Along the way Judy runs into a protruding mammoth tusk and cuts her leg. Nick pulls a handkerchief out of his pocket, blueberries spilling everywhere, and bandages Judy's leg but she tells him to leave her since she can't walk. They try to think of something as they are surrounded by the sheep. Bellwether calls out to Judy, saying that in the city prey outnumber predators 10 to 1. They need to band together to end their mistreatment against the more powerful and loud predators and, once united, will be unstoppable. Judy and Nick run for it but are knocked into a sunken diorama and Nick drops the briefcase. Bellwether retrieves it and looks down on Nick and Judy before taking aim with the gun and shooting Nick. The blue solution covers his neck and he trembles while Bellwether calls the police and feigns alarm, saying Officer Judy is down and being attacked by a savage fox. Judy tells Bellwether her plan won't work as Nick advances on her, growling. Bellwether says that fear always works and, with a predisposition to savagery, predators will be forced out of Zootopia and she'll dart every one to keep it that way. Nick then lunges at Judy and puts his jaws around her neck, but just as quickly releases her as Judy puts on a dramatic performance. Nick and Judy then reveal they switched out the serum in the gun with blueberries and have recorded everything Bellwether said on Judy's pen recorder. Horrified, Bellwether backs up to flee only to be stopped and arrested by the responding ZPD. On the news, an anchor reads that Bellwether was charged for masterminding the savage predator conspiracy. Former Mayor Lionheart gives an interview where he says he didn't know about Bellwether's plot and only caged the savage predators to protect the city, citing he did a wrong thing for the right reasons. It is announced that an antidote has been created with positive effects. Judy goes to the hospital where she sees Emmitt Otterton recovering and embracing his concerned wife. Months later, Judy, a police officer again and much wizened by her experience, addresses the new police academy graduates, one of them being Nick Wilde. She says, \"When I was a kid, I thought Zootopia was this perfect place where everyone got along and anyone could be anything. Turns out, real life's a little bit more complicated than a slogan on a bumper sticker. Real life is messy. We all have limitations. We all make mistakes, which means...hey, glass half full! We all have a lot in common. And the more we try to understand one another, the more exceptional each of us will be. But we have to try. No matter what type of animal you are, from the biggest elephant to our first fox, I implore you: Try. Try to make a difference. Try to make the world a better place. Try to look inside yourself and recognize that change starts with you. It starts with me. It starts with all of us.\" Nick approaches the stage and Judy pins on his cop badge. The next day, Chief Bogo hands out assignments, giving Nick and Judy the task of catching a hot-rodder tearing up the roads downtown. Judy and Nick come across the speeder in their patrol car and pull him over, surprised to see Flash the sloth behind the wheel. Flash smiles slyly at Nick and the credits roll as Gazelle (Shakira) performs 'Try Everything' at a concert in Zootopia with everyone in attendance save for Bellwether who watches the show on TV from prison.",

         "From the studio that brought you Tangled, Wreck-It Ralph, Frozen & Big Hero 6, Zootopia surfaces as a highly original, incredibly refreshing, thoroughly engaging, surprisingly timely & delightfully subversive beast fable about prejudice & stereotype that not only marks a new creative high for Disney but is arguably the finest film that this legendary animation studio has come up with in their Revival Era, so far. Set in a world inhabited by anthropomorphic animals, the story of Zootopia takes place in the titular metropolis and follows a bunny cop named Judy Hopps who, despite her par excellent performance in the class, is assigned parking duty by her superior. But when she volunteers to undertake a missing-predator case, she is given 48 hours to solve the mystery or resign, following which she blackmails a sly fox into helping her, and uncovers a sinister conspiracy. Co-directed by Byron Howard & Rich Moore, the duo put up an intriguing world on the screen that does have a fresh quality but there is still a deep sense of familiarity to it. However, where the two leave a lasting impression is in finding that perfect balance between its consistently gripping storyline & moments of pure hilarity. The writing staff also deserves a mention, for their screenplay brims with numerous pop culture references, parodies many renowned classics & handles its topical themes with care. The 3D animation is absolutely top-notch, for the images retain its crispness, clarity & vibrancy from beginning to end. The animators put up a vast number of characters on the screen, ranging from the largest elephant to the smallest shrew, yet they are all given a well-defined arc. Cinematography further enhances the overall look n feel of the story with its fluid camera-work, splendid use of colour palette & spot-on lighting. Editing provides just enough screen time to all the relevant characters while moving the plot forward at a blistering pace. The cast is wisely chosen, and all the actors do a competent job in lending their voice & soul to the mammals they play. Ginnifer Goodwin brings a bubbly side to the new cop in town and confidently plays her role. Jason Bateman plays his part with finesse plus his voice really fits his cynical con artist character. Also, the chemistry between the two is a highlight in itself. Michael Giacchino's ebullient score seamlessly blends in & compliments the narrative while Shakira beautifully wraps everything up with a catchy, uplifting & wonderful song that smartly summarises its themes & message. On an overall scale, Zootopia finds Disney stepping out of its comfort zone to tackle a bold, ambitious & risky project, and it is one gamble that pays off tremendously well in the studio's favour. Also, its arrival couldn't have been better, considering how its elements of prejudice & stereotypes mirror the racial hostilities present in our very own current social environment. An ingenious blend of sophisticated storytelling, jubilant humour & thought-provoking themes that amazes, entertains & enlightens without ever compromising with the fun factor, Zootopia is a definite delight for viewers of all ages, and is undoubtedly the best film of the year, so far. Strongly recommended.",
         "A cute and smart rabbit Judy Hopps is so ambitious and intelligent.She wants to become a police officer. No bunnies ever before became police officers in the animal world of Zootopia because they are not strong enough. But Judy doesn't care what other people and animals think about her . She wants to overcome the prejudice and bigotry that a rabbit is small and weak animal and thus is not fit to become a police officer. She's determined to make her dream come true, but unfortunately for her,she faces problems. She caught a convicted Fox who has already committed a crime, and gave him the option that she can help him to avoid jail imprisonment if only he can definitely help her in finding the missing animals. As a result, the fox and the bunny become friends and because of the intelligence of the amazing Judy (the bunny) she cleverly tamed the sly fox and attracted him to do the good and to refrain from doing evil especially after he fell in love with this yummy bunny Judy. Zootopia is best of the best for the spectacular cinematography,impressive story,enchanting music and stunning acting.",

There is no kind of racism or violence:\" It is a perfect world where love,equality and peace of mind rule\". It is true that peace can never happen in any place in the world if there is oppression,racism,inequality and discrimination. Walt Disney Pictures clearly delivers a useful moral of love,unity,integrity and peace of mind. This Top movie also stresses on the fact that drugs are harmful. Zootopia tells the story of a rabbit named Judy Hopps (Goodwin) who wants to be the first rabbit cop, so she joins the ZPD (Zootopia Police Department). The smart and cute female rabbit plans to achieve justice in Zootopia. This masterpiece movie is highly recommended for all kids and for every adult individual in the world who seek justice,freedom and peace of mind. Honestly Speaking ZOOTOPIA IS INDEED A TERRIFIC WALT Disney MOVIE.",
         "In a world populated by anthropomorphic mammals, Judy Hopps, a rabbit from rural Bunnyburrow, fulfills her dream of becoming the first rabbit officer in the police department of nearby city Zootopia. However, upon arrival, she is assigned parking duty by Chief Bogo, an African buffalo, who doubts her potential due to her being a rabbit and thus smaller than most of the large animals on the force. During one of her shifts, she meets Nick Wilde, a con artist fox. Hopps abandons her shift to arrest a thief, Duke Weaselton. She is reprimanded by Bogo and nearly fired until Mrs. Otterton, an otter, arrives pleading for help locating her missing husband \u2013 one of many animals recently missing in Zootopia. To Bogo's dismay, Hopps volunteers and agrees to resign if she cannot solve the case within 48 hours. She sees Wilde in the last known photo of Otterton and tracks him down, coercing him into to assisting her with the investigation. After acquiring Mr. Otterton's license plate number, Hopps and Wilde track the vehicle to Mr. Big, an Arctic shrew crime boss. Mr. Big informs the pair that Otterton, his florist, had gone savage and attacked his chauffeur Manchas, a black jaguar. Hopps and Wilde locate Manchas, who mentions \"night howlers\" were responsible for attacking him before he goes savage and chases the pair out of his home. When Bogo and his reinforcements arrive, Manchas disappears. Bogo demands Hopps resign, but Wilde takes a stand, insisting they have 10 more hours to solve the case. As the pair leaves, Hopps learns from Wilde that he was bullied by prey animals as a pup and became a criminal, believing he would be stereotyped as one no matter what due to being a fox. Wilde realizes that the city's traffic camera system may have captured Manchas's disappearance, and the pair consult Assistant Mayor Bellwether, a sheep. They identify the captors as wolves, hence \"night howlers\". Hopps and Wilde locate the missing mammals (including Mr. Otterton) at Hillside Asylum. All are predators, and all have gone savage like Manchas. The two discover Mayor Lionheart consulting with a doctor about the predators' condition. The pair escape with the evidence and the police swarm the area, arresting Lionheart. Having developed a friendship with Wilde throughout the case, Hopps requests that he joins the Zootopia Police Department and become her partner, which Wilde happily considers. However, during a press conference, Hopps mentions that the savage animals are predators and argues they have gone back to their \"natural state.\" Wilde is hurt and angrily walks out on her offer. Fear and discrimination against predators spreads across Zootopia, and a guilt-ridden Hopps resigns. During this time, pop singer Gazelle holds a peaceful protest and publicly asks for the harmonious Zootopia she loves to be restored. Back in Bunnyburrow, Hopps learns that \"night howlers\" are flowers that have a severe psychotropic effects on mammals. Hopps returns to Zootopia and reconciles with Wilde. They locate Weaselton and learn that he has been collecting night howlers for a secret laboratory. The pair discover the lab and find ram scientists creating a night howler serum, which has been injected into predators via dart guns. Hopps and Wilde race to the ZPD with the evidence, but the rams pursue them. Just short of the ZPD, the pair encounters Bellwether, who tries to take the evidence. Realizing Bellwether is the mastermind of a species-supremacist conspiracy, Hopps and Wilde try to flee, but Bellwether shoots a dart at Wilde and calls the ZPD for help. Wilde becomes savage and corners Hopps, but it turns out the pair were acting and had swapped out Bellwether's darts for blueberries. With Bellwether's confession recorded on Hopps's carrot pen, the two have enough evidence to unravel the conspiracy. Some months later, Hopps is reinstated into the ZPD. The savaged mammals are cured. Lionheart is cleared of all charges and is reinstated as mayor. Wilde joins the ZPD as the first fox officer and Judy's new partner. In the final scene, all of Zootopia enjoys a performance by Gazelle, who dances with four tigers.",
         "\"Zootopia\" is simply the best animated movie of the year 2016 because the animation was terrific,the acting was mesmerizing and the plot was impressively perfect. A female bunny Judy Hopps faces discrimination from other prejudiced and bigoted animals who made fun of her size and could not believe her strong determination to be a cop. since Judy is brainy and has a strong will to be a successful cop,she made a deal with a sly fox to get what she wants. When the genius and the yummy bunny Judy became a policewoman,she was so just and confident in dealing with other animals and soon she receives all the estimation from all the animals including the previously prejudiced animals who underestimated it.",
         "From the largest elephant to the smallest shrew, the city of Zootopia is a mammal metropolis where various animals live and thrive. When Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin) becomes the first rabbit to join the police force, she quickly learns how tough it is to enforce the law. Determined to prove herself, Judy jumps at the opportunity to solve a mysterious case. Unfortunately, that means working with Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman), a wily fox who makes her job even harder. I am absolutely sure Zootopia Will Be Number 1 In All Countries Of The World Without Any Exaggeration. Since This Movie is The Production Of Disney,it has to be perfect.",
         "I hadn't planned on seeing this film (I feel we are over-saturated with animated films these day, most of them mediocre), but I looked on as my kids watched it. This is a really fine film. It takes on issues of prejudice and cultural diversity. Zootopia is a city where animals live side by side, predator and prey. It is not a utopia because law and order is necessary. A little female rabbit messes with the male dominated police force. She is put on duty as a meter maid and realizes sexism along with her species is under attack. She is feisty and eventually hooks up with a con-man fox (the least trusted species) whom she enlists to help her solve a kidnapping case. Actually, it's otter napping. In the process, she reveals her own prejudices and hurts her partner. The movie has stunning animation and intelligent dialogue and lots of social references. Very good stuff.",
         "Plot: In a city of anthropomorphic animals, a rookie bunny cop and a cynical con artist fox must work together to uncover a conspiracy. This was a film that I was hoping would be good, since most trailers can trick you these days but this film surpassed my expectations. Each of the voice actors do a wonderful job playing their characters, the standouts are Ginnifer Goodwin who plays a really likable and relatable character and Jason Bateman who plays a character that is at fist unlikable but manages to improve throughout the film. This is not your typical kids film, it doesn't have the bathroom jokes like in most kids films. The script is smartly written and uses the message effectively unlike others which beats you over the head with theirs. Zootopia is one of my favorite films of the year, if you haven't seen it, give it a chance it's not your typical kids film which is what I like, I just wish more of them were like this.",
         "Zootopia is a perfectly hilarious and remarkable movie not only for children,but also for adults. A rabbit Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin) peacefully fights for the rights of weak animals.(A good theme from the great Disney). There are several animals with various characters and different traits exactly as there are numerous individuals with different characters. The script is didactic,great and funny. Just like us Virtuous Christians And Good Mormons,we never discriminate against Jews,Muslims, Blacks.... et cetera so is this movie's terrific theme:\"Don't have prejudice and discrimination about others. Learn to treat others well, respect and estimate others exactly the way you would love to be treated\".",
         "You owe it to yourself to see Disney's new animated film Zootopia, a film so timely and relevant it's almost startling. You owe it to yourself to seek it out in a time in America where craziness, hatefulness, and fear is being further instilled in the general public by the very same people who should be fighting against it; the very same people who should be forcing us, as a collective, to rise above simple-minded assertions and mass generalizations about the people around us. You owe it to yourself to see this film simply because it's a brand new Disney classic. The film takes place in the vibrant, diverse world of Zootopia, a place where predators and prey live together in harmony, and are free to be whoever and whatever they want to be. These reasons are precisely why the land attracts Judy Hopps (voiced by Ginnifer Goodwin), a small bunny with dreams of being a police officer. Living on a farm, her parents fear this because, not only has a bunny never become a police officer, but they feel Judy should confine her aspirations to selling carrots on the family farm, something Judy has no interest in doing. After successfully completing police training, Judy is thrust into the force alongside other, more muscled animals such as rhinoceroses, rams, bulls, and elephants. Oh my. Judy's boss, Chief Bogo (Idris Elba), a buffalo, forces her to be a \"metermaid\" while the other animals take on the bigger crimes, specifically a case involving fourteen missing predators. Judy tries to show herself by issuing over two-hundred citations in just a couple of hours, but to no avail, as Chief Bogo wants to make sure she knows her place on the Zootopia police force. When Judy winds up catching a weasel after robbing a store, she is just about to be fired when Chief Bogo tasks her with finding a local otter who has been missing for over a week. If she can find the otter in forty-eight hours or less, she can keep her job, but if she doesn't, she'll be forced to resign. Judy enlists in the help of Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman), a fox, one of the most looked-down-upon predators in Zootopia, who has been doing number of odd jobs since he was young, after blackmailing him in order to get him to cooperate. Together, the two work to find the otter, but in turn, discover something bigger. Oh my. Zootopia wears its intentions on its sleeves, but not in a way that distracts or simplifies its core themes. As you can probably tell, this is a film about both racism and sexism, two features of society that, while probably never going away so long as humans roam the Earth, do not have to be such amplified forces of hate. Screenwriters Jared Bush and Paul Johnston carefully construct a world, predicated upon a particular dream, and within that world, populate it with a variety of characters, some labeled as normative, others quietly labeled as the enemy that many are waiting to step out of line. It doesn't take a scholar to see that rabbits represent women in society, while predators represent minorities. It does, however, take considerable screen writing talent to create a film that can be enjoyed and understood by both children and adults on a fairly similar level. Even Pixar's Inside Out was a film that sort of teetered a bit more to the adult crowd, with its lofty morals about children coping with their emotions, despite the fact that kids of all ages could at least enjoy the film as surface-level entertainment. Bush and Johnston pen Zootopia carefully, but bluntly, to the point where you can't ignore its profound, but simple message of inclusion and acceptance of peers. Oh my. Countless animated films have made themselves about preaching the gospel of acceptance and loving thy neighbor, but few have done it with the kind of thematic relevance, consistent wit, and zealous energy as Zootopia. Rather than sticking too a cleverly storyboarded, intricate plot, Bush and Johnston also have no problem playing around, allowing both Judy and Nick to free-roam in a sandbox full of original characters and allowing conversational/situational humor to prevail. This is why we get uproariously funny sequences involving three-toed sloths at the DMV, in addition to immensely creative, blink-and-you-miss-it chase sequences between a rabbit and a weasel. The film is not short on ideas nor energy, and the remarkable thing is how the film can go almost one-hundred miles an hour in every department and not even come close to running out of gas by the end credits. Zootopia is a contemporary Disney classic and should be treated as such; it will certainly give Pixar's questionable Finding Dory a run for its money in quality, awards, and overall relevance when it comes out this summer. This is a film that finds a way to be both sweet and simple, yet so urgent and topical, with an A-list voice cast, that you feel it's a soft rallying cry for unity, which is all the more reason why you shouldn't ignore it. Voiced by: Ginnifer Goodwin, Jason Bateman, Idris Elba, J.K. Simmons, Tommy Chong, and Octavia Spencer. Directed by: Byron Howard and Rich Moore.",
         "Stupidity took this movie down while the premise still had some allure as being somewhat of a modern-day \"animal farm\"but sadly that wasn't the case here. It is certainly not a classic because it's build to much in to today's standards and contains the same elements as a lot of today's movies like feminism,racism and sexism. Other factors that are connected to theses elements are not so much highlighted like religion or social structures within this society. It wants to preach diversity but gives a one-sided view to the story and gives all kinds of awkward messages doing so. All the focus was on the bunny and the rest of the characters seem to tag a long to make sure everyone is better in the end by meeting her because she is such an inspiration.It reminded me a little of the 'Rey\"character in\" the forge awakens\"but than to a lesser extent.A \"close to Mary Sue\" character basically. I wanted more entertainment out this and also a story that served all the people and not the few \"hot topics\"that are only important for a couple of years.I think that with the passing of time the movie will loose momentum and that it is not the timeless piece that people said it was. The Shakira song was terrible and did not fit the movie at all and the animation was \"acceptable\".I had a few laughs but not nearly as many as i get from watching a 20 minute episode of Southpark. I was disappointed by it but by looking at the raving reviews realized I pretty much stand alone in this. It's not bad.....just blatant PC. Nice bunny,but no bugs! Fox this!",
         "A cute female rabbit becomes a police officer and is instantly the best officer the world has ever seen - surpassing all of her dumb male co- workers who belittle her for being just a cute dumb bunny. The film then descends into a commentary on racial issues as the rabbit says that a bunch of predators may be attacking people as \"its in their DNA\" and the media and politicians whip up mass hysteria to control the people (ok, that part is pretty valid). The rabbit then learns her lesson about how it's wrong to call out dangerous criminals if they're all from the same race, and that it was really the government manipulating the predators into being evil. The sloths were pretty funny, though.",
         "This movie is often seen as being an excellent action-humor combo containing a great moral component. I will briefly try to explain while it is neither of those things. First, I'll start by admitting that the humor present in the movie can work if you put yourself in a certain mood. It is combined with a great visual production aiming at putting you in that exact light-hearted mood, which works fine. The problem is largely the plot: it is uninspired (recycled) and things seems to happen as if they came from a magician's hat. Of course, this wouldn't be a problem if the random/surprising elements where entertaining. The problem is that, while it somehow works in the beginning, where the evolution of the plot make us discover Zootopia, the story becomes quickly bland an uninteresting as the movie enter an action phase. As for the interesting moral components this movie is credited for, they are inexistent. The whole lesson of the whole thing appears to be that you shouldn't listen to your prejudices, and you should be accepting of everybody. We could also add the classical: you can be anything you want if only you would try hard enough. I would start by saying that these \"lessons\" are so obvious and in-your-face that they cannot have any effect on children. They are what the movie SAYS, but in fact the movie DOES something very different. What it does is to make a link between a character's specie and his personality (in direct contradiction with the lesson about prejudice and promoting inclusion). It also treat most supporting character as pure stereotypes based on specie, which reduce their humanity in the eye of the viewer while using it as joke material. So what the movie in fact does is to tell you that large chunk of population have very few value, while those who deserve respect are the ones who \"work hard\" to obtain and maintain power over others, be it by wise manipulation or socially recognized opportunity to exert physical domination of others (police). This also implies that those who the film laugh at are deserving of their situation, as they didn't work hard enough to raise above the masses. In short, this movie is a montage of jokes with a plot to support those jokes, which tries to compensate for its lack of substance with \"lessons\" that are nothing more than virtue-signaling.",
         "This movie scared the living daylights out of my 3 and 4 year old. The content was not really funny (It had a couple of spots but they were few and far between). The worst part of the movie was a Silence of the Lambs Insanity Ward where the beasts were kept. (Remember Jody Foster getting semen thrown at her) My children cried and we left the theater when the (spoiler alert, near the end) . The movie should be rated PG13 as the themes were more suited to teenagers who could handle aggressive animals, mob mentality of killing someone, New York style hardcore sarcasm where no one cares about anyone, and Meth lab where an insane looking sheep in an DU HAST video with air breather is making \"night howler\" I am a guy that has seen his fair share of freaky, and I love a good movie (going for Apocalypse Now tonight) BUT this show is not for kids, and I am aghast that Disney put it out. I remember enjoying the time of Toy Story, Nemo, Hero 6, Wall-e, Up and great Disney Movies (Shrek, Shark Tale, Madagascar from the \"other guys\") This movie was to deep in subject matter and the message was for teenagers and not little children.",
         "Well, as always, critics and people will love this movie, cause it's Disney!(which I deeply love). In reality it's because there haven't been great animated movies in a decade and people are not even noticing how much the standard level is more and more lowering(except Tangled and Toy Story 3, the others were good ideas, with cheap, bland and boring results). GRAPHICS: Once again, we have an animated movie that try to reach even more graphical perfection: the world is wonderfully detailed but its pretty clear that every character of every movie created in CG will look the same. The way they move, the eyes, the facial expressions, are so graphically realistic and at the same time done with exaggerated animated acting, that it's always like watching bad mimes who are playing a part. Rating: 9\\10 for the world, 3\\10 for the characters(and that's almost the maximum for CGI). CHARACTERS: The fact that Disney can't create great characters anymore is depressing. The characters are boring once again; they are just created to give the most banal and predictable comedy one can watch on a TV sit-com. That's exactly the kind of humor in animation and comedy movies by now. Or even more easy: \"Look! an hamster who moves like an hamster! funny!\". The fact that an animal has its animal characteristics is the minimum I expect from Disney animation, and even more in the aesthetic normality of the world Zootopia, not treated as a joke. Or even worse, all the pop-culture references, cause they are funny! Ratings: 4\\10 STORY: The story is kind of good, with a dark tone, and somewhat interesting, but again, the characters are so bland in their predictable personality that I didn't managed to care very much. The point is that, in great artists hand, this could have been a nice movie. Ratings: 6\\10 And then we got the today moral lesson. That's not a fault for this movie to be honest, because it seems every animated movie must have a moral. And I still don't understand why . Animated movies are an aesthetic art, just like another movie, and not an educational lesson. It's because adults are so dumb nowadays(I'm sorry, but we all know that) that think if something is not educational is not for children. I have an information for you: children are smarter than adults, and they need to be treated as such. Disney, please, don't waste too much time coming up with lessons and a movie created around it, give us some GREAT CHARACTERS AND STORIES like you used to do, and the great lessons of life would come along. FINAL RATINGS: My vote is 5 on a total scale(of all time), and a 7 in the last ten years scale; but the whole feeling of the movie (the characters, the humor, the dynamics) is always the same of every recent animated movie, so I lower it to 2(since I know everybody will give it 10\\10).",
         "The result did not match the marketing. Story is so so but visuals like usual so great and pretty. Yep, children love what they see and what story? Basic zoology that fox eats rabbit, predator and prey, habitat, animal behavior etc. Then this prey and predator become friends and escaped the horror of deviantart. Rabbit jumps, fox is sly, lion mayor, wolf in sheep's clothing, otter is a predator (the predators are bulky and this is a cutie???), sloth is slow. This year children will learn so much about animals adding zyuohger and kung fu panda and what else? I was wrong to hope for a good story from a cartoon but oh well who cares when you got beautiful art.",
         "I was blown away by this. I didn't expect this movie to be like it was. This film is not like it is being promoted, of course it is funny and a little goofy... but it is way more than this. This movie has a lot to say about racism, drugs and other serious issues in life and it succeeded in every way. This movie was not boring one bit, the animations were hands down amazing and I got nothing else to say but: Go and watch this movie you won't be disappointed. Everything is completely thought through and there is a mind blowing amount of detail here for you to see and all of this makes it worth watching more than just one time only. A lot of people cried in my theater, very emotional movie. Also: Great voice acting, extremely funny scene at the end.",
         "Bright, bubbly, breakneck: all defining characteristics of Disney's latest animated adventure. Sanctimonious, serious, seldom funny: other key traits that suffocate this family film until there's very little left to enjoy. With multiple ecosystems and a plethora of cultural subsets \u2013 mirroring our own society wouldn't you know \u2013 the anthropomorphic animal-world is conceptually interesting and beautifully animated, but the story told within this universe is disappointingly dull. The simple predators-and-prey-living-together plot device should've been ripe for subtle metaphors amongst zippy action and constant laughs, yet the film's themes \u2013 breaking down stereotypes, looking past race, being inclusive \u2013 are hammered home so heavy-handedly it feels like you're getting in trouble. A major issue is the lack of humour (or more accurately: successful humour) which, save for a truly hilarious sloth-centred sequence that had me in tears, is woefully misjudged and/or drowned out by the persistence of shoving a point down our throat. The muddled tone makes for a confusing viewing too; the unapologetic innocent nature of proceedings suggests this is aimed squarely at the toddler demographic, yet the Godfather and 'Breaking Bad' references are directly at odds with this. The infectiously optimistic bunny at the movie's heart, Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin), is a sweet and likable protagonist, however the mischievous fox who partners with Hopps, Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman), has more depth and charisma. A lower-rung Disney effort with a gratingly obvious agenda, Zootopia hints at brilliance but frustratingly falls way short.",
         "A great example of how didactism bores rather than inspires, regurgitates rather than re-imagines. There's a clear political message, and the unabashed way which it is presented won't change any minds, but at the least may spark political debate. Though its singular treatment preaching the current \"hip\" left-wing social platforms without nuance does nothing to elucidate any new ideas or attempt to shed new truths on issues that allow people to re-evaluate their current ideological stances. As such, its effect is similar to that of the person talking politics at the cocktail party who relies on volume rather than substance in order to bolster their (or more accurately their party's) talking points. All in all, though there are some witty scenes and stereotypical romance & coming of age story lines, the overpowering pedantic verbal diarrhea exposes it as a thinly veiled political commercial rather than a great piece of art. The ratings, therefore, represent the extent to which the audience agrees with its sermon rather than recognizes its degree of unbiased (with respect to 21st century American politics) aesthetic merit.",
         "Zootopia is another attempt to propagandize for multiculturalism, coming from the same studio which once produced an uplifting allegory for traditional white identity and aristocracy. In line with the dominant elite view on race, it manages to simultaneously push wild-eyed optimism and a paranoid victim attitude. Considering that it met with very positive critical response, including praise for its political message, the subtitle might as well be This is What Our Elites Actually Believe. As the title implies, the film depicts an unrealistic society inhabited by various animals. The heroine, Judy Hopps, is an effervescent rabbit from a rural area whose parents hope that she will become a carrot farmer like themselves. Their bluntly stated and cartoonish view is that you should not try new things because you might fail. Rejecting this view, Judy aspires to be a police officer, unmoved by their insistence that no bunny has ever held that title. A fox bully assaults her and tells her again of the mismatch between her species and her career aspirations, but she ignores this as well. The multicult message continues when Judy gets ready to leave for Zootopia to begin her law enforcement career. Her parents display excessive concern over her possible future encounters with foxes, offering her fox repellent and even a taser to defend herself with. They remind her of her experience with the fox Gideon Grey who assaulted her years ago, but our heroine recites lines to the effect of \"NAXALT\" and \"some of us are jerks too.\" Nick then recounts how he consciously decided that if others saw him as untrustworthy, he might as well act that way. Now an adult, he had bragged earlier in the film that he had been running scams every day since the age of 12. There was no mention of previous antisocial tendencies. The accusation that others' rejection can turn an otherwise respectable person into a professional lowlife is of course paranoid, but familiar to anyone who has heard the terms \"marginalized\" or \"stereotype threat.\" The fox serves as an expression of the external locus of control so common among dysfunctional people. Blaming external racist forces for degeneracy in one's own group should be a familiar concept to American viewers. This plot point is reminiscent of conspiracy theories about the CIA inventing and/or distributing crack cocaine to keep the Black man down, or similar popular theories concerning HIV. The seminal 1944 title An American Dilemma by the Swedish sociologist Gunnar Myrdal accused White prejudices of encouraging low standards of morality among Blacks, which in turn reinforced White prejudices, and so on in a vicious cycle. Of course, today even the implication that there are different standards of morality between races or nationalities would be dismissed as racist. Other than of the victims of the conspiracy, there is no mention in the film of any actual difference in values or behavior between contemporary predators and prey animals. However, the differences between species in Zootopia are dramatic, not only in size and shape but in some aspects of behavior. The sloths who form the staff of the DMV are as slow as actual sloths, even in their speech. There is no pretense of equality in this context; Nick even sarcastically asks Judy if she thinks that someone must be slow just because he is a sloth. Integration of sloths into rabbit or sheep classrooms would obviously be absurd. The film's denunciation of racism is partly based on attempts at humor, which is an appropriate choice for propaganda. Judy praises Nick as \"articulate\" and he responds by complimenting her on how \"non-patronizing\" she is, highlighting her \"racism.\" Nick touches the sheep assistant mayor's wool without her knowledge, comically amused by how fluffy it is. Judy reprimands him to the effect that \"you can't just touch a sheep's wool.\" She makes another reference to the racial sensitivities of American Blacks when she explains that a bunny can call another bunny cute, but when another animal does it, it is offensive. The portrayal of \"racist\" characters is not as vitriolic as social justice warriors might like, but of course still fits with the overall agenda. While some \"prejudiced\" characters such as the elephant storekeeper and the young Gideon Gray are portrayed as hostile, the racist parents are portrayed as earnest and good-natured yet ignorant. Judy is to some degree portrayed the same way, when she innocently suggests that the basis of the predators going savage might be something in their biology. The results are not harmless though, as she triggers a wave of \"xenophobia\" against predators. Nick makes a great show of being offended by her racist thoughts, even testing her to confirm that she is in fact afraid of him, and she resigns in shame. Zootopia makes a weak attempt at being less than utopian; Judy's original expectations of a city where everyone gets along are shown to be overly optimistic, which she ultimately admits in a voice-over at the end of the film. The attempts at justifying continued faith in multiculturalism come off as desperate, though. Judy recites slogans such as \"real life's a bit more complicated than a slogan,\" adding that the \"glass is half full\" and \"we all have a lot in common,\" but she does not sound as though she actually believes it. Of course, no one ever presents any particular reason to believe it; those who do not are simply not presented as reliable sources. The film ends with a scantily clad gazelle performing a degenerate pop song by the Colombian singer Shakira which further highlights the underlying mindset. The lyrics of \"Try Everything\" celebrate mindless optimism and seem to be intended as a cheap form of therapy for someone who has a crippling fear of failure, reassuring them that \"nobody learns without getting it wrong\" and \"sometimes we come last but we did our best.\"",
         "The problem with this title , and this serves as a warning to parents , is that is nothing like the trailer ! I took both my grandchildren to see it and regret it. Violence, scary Unnecessary scenes of deep darkness and monsters! Only funny part is the sloths at the information counters... They really wasted great pictures and technology on this one. The title song with Shakira is wonderful.. But the balance is very disappointing. I wish i had known of that before. Again ,one of those cases where a trailer is so misleading! Please talk to people who have seen it to see if they agree.Would like to know if other people share my opinion.",
         "Walking into the theatre, I expected to at least be entertained by Disney's 55th animated movie, after the crazy streak that is Tangled, Wreck-It Ralph, Big Hero 6 and Inside Out. Thank you Disney, for taking my expectations, crushing them so hard and renewing my faith that Disney is still steadily improving. (However, I am likely to be disappointed after this movie, just goes to show how much this movie elevated my expectations. It's that good, to me at least). Why do I like this movie so much? That is because within its entertaining buddy cop facade, it shows a lot more and has a lot of relevant messages to tell. It unfolds at an engaging pace and will manage to surprise viewers. Protagonist Judy Hopps (voiced by the bubbly Ginnifer Goodwin) has big dreams and wants to prove the world wrong - that a tiny bunny can take on the big mammal job of a police officer. This is certainly something that connects well with the audience. She wants to break the small-animals-can't-do-tough-mammal-job stereotype. Ironically, she is eventually roped into a battle with her own subconscious stereotypes of others. Meanwhile, you have the flip side in Nick Wilde (voiced by Jason Bateman, who has no problem playing an animated version of himself), who succumbs to his stereotype. What seemed to be a message that \"you can be anything\" slowly turns into a (surprisingly) timely lesson on tolerance in diversity, discrimination and racial politics. The two lead characters Judy and Nick, have great chemistry and you'll find yourself rooting for them throughout (some even want more chemistry *ahem*. A lot more). Chief Bogo (voiced by Idris Elba) and Ben Clawhauser (voiced by Nate Torrence) were nice additions to the cast, though the lack of focus on them is understandable. J.K. Simmons and Jenny Slate also lends their unique voices to Mayor Lionheart and Asst Mayor Bellweather, both of which are remarkably well-suited. To make it more fun, the movie is also riddled with references (both in pop culture and biological), hidden jokes and easter eggs. However, adults will probably have a lot more fun with these as they cater to the older audiences, like with the Godfather reference. Last but not least, the animation is beautiful. Everything, from characters to architecture to effects, looks spot on. All in all, this movie was awesome. It is guaranteed fun for the whole family (though kids might be a little scared at certain points). I enjoyed it thoroughly (maybe even felt close to crying) and I certainly would like to see more, sequels or series, just please keep the voice actors. Kudos to Disney once again. *Fair warning though, be careful with Google* 10/10",
         "Sluggish plot that is kind of predictable, a violent detective story that was not exactly for kids, but most of all it was chock-full of multicultural leftist propaganda that will leave you thinking you just watched a govt infomercial. The entire movie was a thinly-veiled message on tolerating the more 'aggressive' members of our society (who were all more 'ethnic' animals) and learning to trust/adopt rather than deport them. I think Frozen marked the beginning of the shift toward the left that Disney will be doing for the next films. I don't think I'm going to see any more of them. Children's movies should not be tools for political messaging.",
         "I enjoyed this movie far more than i expected to. Things i liked. The relationship between judy hopps and nick wilde was really special and i enjoyed watching their interaction and growing friendship, they are both as heroic and smart as one another and although judy is this adventurous and outgoing go getter type of character for a few brief scenes she also had an emotional side i think it was delivered with great balance. I take zero pleasure admitting tears were in my eyes throughout this movie. The humour although present throughout was never shoved down your throat which lead to a nice upbeat and colourful atmosphere and that's not to mention all the great design decisions behind the world created here. For example Ergonomics with giraffes in mind e.g a funnel to deliver a drink from ground level to giraffe height and small doors for mice. People should watch this movie for the world alone. I could continue to shower this gem with praise but instead i'll list the things that bothered me about this film, the first thing is that the film was too short like no really i wish this film lasted an hour or so longer, the plot seems incredibly rushed at the end i never saw the plot twist coming and didn't predict the direction the film would go down but i feel it's because the culprit behind it all has come and gone within 5 minutes is arrested there's no build up or tension in the uncovering of the secrets behind the commotion which is a shame. I also feel like the chief of police was a relatively poor character and most of the characters in the film could do with more fleshing out. All things said and done go watch this it is great.",
         "Okay. Let me be honest here. I knew I would enjoy this film since I saw the trailer, but I did not think I would like it THIS much! Now, like most of my reviews, I am going to keep it brief. I do not want to spoil this movie because, unless you have already seen it, I would say its worth seeing. This movie really changed my perspective on Disney. The film had my attention the entire time, I was never bored at any part. In fact, I was so caught into this movie, that when I went to set down my drink, I missed the cup-holder and dropped it! It did not spill but anyway, not to get off topic, it was an overall great film. This is one of the few movies that will receive a 10/10 rating. I was impressed, would recommend to anyone, not just kids. So, in conclusion, one of the best Disney movies I have ever seen, would watch again."
