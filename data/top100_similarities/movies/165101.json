I don't know why they skipped that book from adapting which was done in the last minutes by the production house. My guess is it might be a controversial as the first one, or simply not good enough for the cinematic version. Anyway, this film was not as good as previous two. Once again, it was directed by Ron Howard and Tom Hanks returned as professor Robert Langdon. Two hours long, but very fast storytelling, non-stop adventures.\r\n\r\nThis is another tale in the series about fighting against the men who believes in the ancient text that's written about to curb the issue the human would face in the future, which is now. After waking up without any memory, professor Langdon with the help of a young woman escape from an assassin. In result, they look for the reason why and whoever behind it wants them dead. So it's not a good story, but entertaining film. Especially if you like action-adventure- suspense.\r\n\r\nNice cast, including Hanks and Jones. The other supporting cast was not bad either. Like always, it's a European adventure, particularly in Venice and neighbouring countries. Some cool secret places, might be the settings, but awesome. Since this part was not received well, I wonder the next one, 'Origin' would be made or not. Even before that, this time I expect 'The Lost Symbol' first to hit if they want to continue with the film series. This is not a film to recommend, but not bad for watching it once.\r\n\r\n_6/10_",

      "synopsis": "Florence, Italy A team of agents are chasing geneticist Bertrand Zobrist (Ben Foster) through the streets. Zobrist runs up to the top of a tower when he is confronted by Christoph Bouchard (Omar Sy). Bouchard demands that Zobrist tell him the location of something important and potentially dangerous. Zobrist instead drops himself out the window of the tower and hits two roofs on the way down before smashing to the ground. Professor Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) is in a hospital bed. He has a head wound and is suffering from disturbing visions of a hellish scene in which people are shown writhing in pain, while others are burnt and some people have their heads turned backwards. Langdon hears voices and sees someone in a hood, along with other people wearing plague masks. When he awakens, he meets Dr. Sienna Brooks (Felicity Jones), who claims to have been a fan of Langdon's work since she was a child. Sienna tells Langdon he is suffering from retrograde amnesia as a result of the wound. Moments later, an assassin named Vayentha (Ana Ularu) comes in disguised as an officer. She shoots one doctor and then tries to break into Langdon's room to kill him. Langdon and Sienna escape the room, but Langdon is losing blood after the IV is pulled off his arm. They make it into a cab as Langdon passes out. Langdon wakes up in Sienna's home. He asks her for coffee, despite somehow forgetting the word for it. As she goes to get it, Langdon looks on his laptop to check his emails. He finds one from a man named Ignazio Busoni (Gabor Urmai). The message states that Ignazio is safe, as is something that he and Langdon have apparently stolen, as well as the message \"Paradise Twenty Five\". Among Langdon's possessions, he and Sienna find a Faraday pointer, which contains the famous \"Map of Hell\" by Sandro Boticelli, which was inspired by Dante's \"Inferno\". It contains letters and Zobrist's name. The two watch a video of Zobrist speaking about his viewpoints on humanity and how the world must be cleansed. This leads the two to discover that Zobrist wanted to unleash a virus worldwide to wipe out billions of people prior to his suicide. Langdon speaks to someone on the phone from the U.S. consulate about being picked up from his room, only to later find out Vayentha and other officers are there for him, forcing him and Sienna to run again. On the streets, Langdon and Sienna try to figure out the meaning of another statement from the Map of Hell, \"cerca trova\", which is Italian for \"seek and find\". Associates from the World Health Organization are now out looking for Langdon too, including Elizabeth Sinskey (Sidse Babett Knudsen). She orders all her men to not trust anyone and to find Langdon by any means necessary. Vayentha contacts her associates to speak to \"The Provost\". This is Harry Sims (Irrfan Khan), CEO of a firm called The Consortium. One of his men reports to Sims about what Vayentha has told him. Sims also demands to see a video that Zobrist had sent him to be seen after the virus had been released. Langdon and Sienna follow clues to the Palazzo Vecchio to see the painting, \"The Battle of Marciano\", which contains similar writings as the one from the Map. He starts to have more hallucinations and feels a pain in his neck as he remembers being injected with something, leading him to think that he is carrying the virus. Sienna assures him that if he was carrying the virus, everyone around him would probably be dead. They meet with a friend of Langdon's, a museum employee named Marta Alvarez (Ida Darvish). They review security footage and discover that Langdon and Ignazio stole Dante's Death Mask from its exhibit. Langdon must once again run as authorities and museum security get on his tail. Langdon and Sienna run up to the attic over the Apotheosis of Cosimo I. Vayentha encounters the two up there and tries to kill them, but Sienna pushes Vayentha over, causing her to crash through the ceiling and fall to her death. The WHO officials later arrive and see Vayentha's body, and Sinskey appears to recognize her. Langdon and Sienna go to the Florence Baptistry where they locate the mask, following the Paradise Twenty Five clue. On the back of it is another hidden message. Afterward, the two are met by Bouchard, who claims to have been the one that met Langdon in Cambridge prior to his amnesia, and also states that Sinskey and her associates are trying to spread the virus. Bouchard joins him and Sienna as they proceed, but Langdon eventually comes to realize that Bouchard is lying to them and that Sinskey was who he met. Sims and Sinskey meet and discuss the nature of the virus, bringing them to work together to stop it from spreading. After Langdon deduces that the virus is located in the Hagia Sophia, Sienna betrays him and leaves him, revealing that she was Zobrist's lover and is set to carry on his work. Langdon is then knocked out by an assailant. We see an extended flashback of Sienna and Zobrist as lovers as he was explaining his philosophy and work to her, which she grew to follow and support. Since they used to play treasure hunts, Zobrist left clues for her to find in case something were to happen to him. Langdon wakes up and finds he was captured by Bouchard. He was conspiring with Sienna as well. Sims shows up and stabs Bouchard in the neck, killing him. Sims then explains to Langdon that his associates had drugged him with benzodiazepine after he had met with Sinskey and created a fake head wound so that he could help solve the Inferno mystery. Everything that happened in the hospital was also a setup. Langdon and Sims rejoin Sinskey and locate the tomb of Enrico Dandolo, which leads them to figure that the virus will be exposed at the Basilica Cistern in Istanbul. The heroes arrive at the Cistern to stop the spread. Sienna kills Sims as the others race to locate the virus. It's underwater in a container set to be detonated. Langdon tries to stop Sienna, but she blows herself up underwater to ensure the virus will spread. Langdon fights one of Sienna's conspirators, but he is shot by the police. Sinskey then manages to keep the virus contained. The WHO take the virus away. Langdon and Sinskey part ways, but she first returns to him a Mickey Mouse watch that he had lost after their initial meeting. Langdon returns to the museum to ask a security guard to turn the light up on the Dante mask. The guard enters the room and is stunned to discover the mask in its spot. Langdon just walks away smiling.",

         "What happened in the process of adapting the book to script, filming, cutting, editing? Did someone get knocked over on the head or did they just make a decision to kill their own film? In a nutshell: Know that brilliant, creative, controversial yet elegantly beautiful plot twist ending we all know and love from the books? Well, here's a cheesy happy ending. I can just imagine the producers (which happen to be Ron Howard and Brian Graze of Imagine) sitting in their little office going: Mmm.. that ending is crazy! We can't let that happen! What will the audience say? We can't make a STATEMENT like that! YOUR AUDIENCE (a large amount being book readers) are coming to be impressed, to see an interesting look at overpopulation and Dante's inferno and plague images! I mean, the fact of the matter is: Overpopulation is a problem and Dan Brown proposes an elegant solution in the form of a \"plague\" which PLOT TWIST: Doesn't actually kill anyone, but makes the 1/3 of the population (by random) become infertile. It solves the issue without being genocide. No one dies, yet the problem is solved. Elegant, brilliant, shocking, and opens up a conversation about a real life crisis we are facing. Interesting subject relevant to your audience. Right, okay, at some point they decided to change the ending. Which means at the end you are still stuck with the question of overpopulation. The film makers decided to stick with the crowded scenes. So they constantly showing us that THIS IS A PROBLEM that needs to be solved. Or at least something to acknowledge. Did they offer an alternative or did they decide just to stop the bad guy? They decided to stop the bad guys, not offering even a philosophical comment by Professor Langdon. The problem is still staring us in the face as Langdon flirts with W.H.O. director Sinskey and gets his watch back. You did not give us an ending. You did not give us a tying up of knots. You gave us a cheesy, cheap, Hollywood ending that blew up in your face. Also lets talk about the casting choices. Or not. Because it sure looks like they didn't give a crap. I think the producers got scared. Copped out. Underestimated their audience. Just bad storytelling really. What a waste of a Friday evening that was.",
         "Dan Brown is one of my favorite writers, maybe Inferno was not his best book but it was still good enough. i've read it in 2 days , i know a lot of people that loved it. One of the best things about Inferno was the ending, and they decided to leave it out of the movie script... That was a big mistake, that's why i recommend everybody to give the book a chance even if u tried the movie... I gave the book 9 stars out of 10. I can only give the movie 4 stars out of 10. I'm sorry they changed the soul of the movie , they tried to make it more Hollywood and they made a big mistake... Thanks",
         "specially Created my first account to tell Sony what the hell they have done Ending was the biggest let down When you expect the movie to actually show virus being released as compared to the clichÃ© plot of virus being contained in the last moment , it is disappointing and waste of money to be let down Irfan Khan was wasted while Felicity Jones was expressionless For Book lovers it would definitely be a letdown Emotion building was missing, and it was too fast paced that made it a let down.... If you are reading this avoid Inferno...",
         "kind of SPOILER... It doesn't matter casting, direction, location, production, acting and anything if the best part of the book, the GLORIOUS AND GREAT FINALE that made Dan Brown a genius was changed to the most common, stupid ending of a silly Hollywood mystery/thriller movie. It's like if in 'The Empire strikes back', Darth Vader answered: \"yes, I killed your father...\" or in 'Seven', Kevin Spacey is caught by Brad Pitt just in time to save his wife. What the hell were the producers thinking? They had the chance to make one of the best movies in 2016 and just wasted it. Too much shame on Ron Howard for being such a poor director and for Dan Brown for allowing it.",
         "Imagine if Spielberg had directed 'Godfather' and Coppola had directed the Indiana Jones movies. Both great directors, but it wouldn't have worked. Same thing applies here. Like the first two in this franchise, 'Da Vinci Code' and 'Angels and Demons', there's just something terribly wrong with the direction. Yes, the Langdon movies are suppose to be fast paced, but if almost no scenes are allowed to breathe, does it matter? And why do director Ron Howard keep on insisting insulting my intelligence? Like in the first two, many things are explained twice, so even the dumbest one in the audience knows what's going on. Then there's the blatant mistake of shooting the movie in standard widescreen, instead of cinemascope, like the first two. When you make a movie with several visually looking fantastic locales around the world, it SCREAMS cinemascope. And the best park of the book? They completely changed it. Guess they wanted to avoid any controversy. Hans Zimmer's score was great, as usual, though. The first two Langdon-movies are hovering at 6,6 on IMDb. So will this when the dust settles. If the studio decides to make 'Lost Symbol' and - for once - have a Langdon movie getting great reviews, they should probably hire another director.",
         "Possibly Ron Howard's worst film with one contrived situation after another in this convoluted mess of a Da Vinci Code spin off. While the basic premise isn't bad, in fact it was a steal from the Bond film On Her Majesty's Secret Service where a mad scientist wants to kill off half the world's population. What made it as hokey as a Mission Impossible script was one absurd action scene after another where the hero played by Tom Hanks can't seem to shake off people looking for him. The big shocker is when his apparent savior former star of Chalet Girl, Felicity Jones turns out to be another of his enemies.Overall as silly as many low budget B movies.",
         "I enjoyed the Inferno film for the most part as I'm very fond of Tom Hanks as Robert Langdon. One of the main reasons that I like these books so much is because they provide such a wealth of background historical information so they're a prefect blend of education and entertainment. While it was obviously impractical to include an involved literary discussion of Dante's Inferno in the film, it's a shame that it was barely touched on at all as to me, it was one of the most interesting aspects of the entire story. Like many, I was also surprised and disappointed by the changed ending. The book's solution was challenging but elegant; the film\u0085clunky and predictable. Pity.",
         "TL;DR: This movie was good but forgettable. Reading the book beforehand is a positive here and you will want to go see it, but keep expectations down and expect a radically altered story with no lasting impression. If you haven't read the book, prepare to be confused, but it can still be an entertaining ride. Edition watched: 2D IMAX The largest positive for this movie is Tom Hanks. Hank's role here is a slight departure from how he previously played the role, due to the circumstances that are made apparent from the very beginning (but I won't spoil), and yet he was excellent again as Robert Langdon. Aside from Hanks, the story was muddled but chase-movie action and constant changes of beautiful scenery makes this entertaining if forgettable. I have read the book (and liked it) and I went to see it with 2 people who had not read it. For those who haven't read the book, you should know that this is not like the other 2 Dan Brown movies. Those stories dealt with secrets and puzzles from many years ago (hundreds or thousands in some cases) and they had that Indiana Jones for the art history major feel to them. In this movie, all the puzzles are manufactured by a modern day character in the story, so it almost completely lacks that Indiana Jones feel. Even though I had warned my movie companions about this, both were quite disappointed by this aspect. However, the biggest problem my non-book reading movie companions had was confusion. As someone who knew what was going on, even I felt the way they injected some story elements and then dropped them just as fast was a bit dizzying. Given that this movie was adapted for the screen and had radically altered elements from the book, the handling of the story telling was sub par. Both of my movie companions felt the movie was entertaining but nothing special. One sentence opinion: \"It was OK and I enjoyed it.\" and \"It was OK, let's go eat.\" For those who have read the book, in my opinion this movie departs radically from the source material. That said, reading the book is an advantage and might be a compelling reason to go see this. Knowing the book-story means you will know what is going on, even through elements that were not in the book and/or were presented poorly (e.g. skin rash). I found the changes made for a better experience since I wasn't just seeing a rehash of what I had read. That said, among several disappointments, I was looking forward to a Vasari Corridor scene and I was very much let down. One thing to note, Dan Brown's message was pretty much lost and I wonder if that was intentional? Even the ending, which in the book was used to punctuate Dan Brown's obvious point, is radically changed in the movie. So while the basic story is similar, the actual take away I left the theater with was very different from the book. I mark this as negative because the book made me think about what I had taken for a given, the movie simply entertained me and went away afterwards. Overall, as someone who read the book, I enjoyed the movie but did feel let down.",
         "What a hideous piece of virulent, vomitous excrement. The producers truly must have hit Tom Hanks over the head to make him sign up for this sloppy, vacuous piffle. And if you think I'm taking liberties with the English language, that's NOTHING compared to the liberties that Ron Howard took with this gripping, provocative novel by Dan Brown. I'll ignore the lame beginning (endless dream sequences of Hell) and the middle (senseless scrambling around TripAdvisor Top Ten attractions) and focus on the ending. Don't worry, no spoilers here...except that THEY BALLSED IT UP! YOU CANNOT BE SERIOUS!! The major, most critical issue facing the human race, which will, without question, lead to the sort of hell that Dante envisioned, is TOTALLY GLOSSED OVER! Our population could reach 15 Billion as soon as 2100. This number is impossible for the earth to sustain. You think the housing crisis of 2009 (which nobody though would happen) was bad? Oh buddy. Think Soylent Green, friends. This film COULD have made a statement, maybe generating some intelligent discourse on a problem which affects every human on earth, black, white, Muslim, Christian, Country Fans, Metal Heads. But SCREW that! We might upset people! Best to give them a sappy, sickening Twinkie ending to gobble up. Skip this movie. Read the book.",
         "This was just one movie that didn't need to be made, but it was and unfortunately it was made poorly. Tom Hanks and Ron Howard were there again, the locations were beautiful, it was a great cast, and the story had potential to be done right, but it just turned out very wrong. Let's start with the first fifteen minutes where we have to put up with Tom Hanks' amnesia. Dizzying and distorted views and Hanks' big dumb facial expressions. How annoying. They could have trimmed five or ten minutes of this and we still would have gotten the idea. Speaking of the amnesia, it was more of a convenient amnesia where the Hanks character could for instance remember his gmail address and password but couldn't remember what coffee was called. It was just nonsense throughout how he would remember something and not remember something. Another annoyance were the endless chase scenes. Luckily I could fast forward through them though. And another annoyance, the scene where Sidse Babett Knudsen and Tom Hanks save the day. They go in with a group of people to find the deadly disease. They put it in the containment box and then everybody disappears except for the Knudsen character. She's all of a sudden alone with the box and of course gets attacked by a stabbed guy from a previous fight who swims underwater to find Knudsen. Then, Tom Hanks sees the struggle and jumps in. All of this time nobody else is there from the dozens of people that came in from the World Health Organization. Where did they all go? So dumb. Lastly, the billionaire who came up with this plan to wipe out half the world's population is apparently capable enough to come up with such a virus but incapable of coming up with a backup plan. So, there's only one bag of this virus instead of dozens or hundreds. His backup plan in case he was killed was to create a cryptic path for his girlfriend to murder her way through just to find and blow up this one bag. So stupid. Just one sloppy thing after another. It appears Ron Howard has lost his touch because this could have been done so much better.",
         "I never did read the Dan Brown books and solely went to see this movie with the previous two movies as background. What a disappointment! The movie starts with Robert Langdon having flashbacks and weird visions. By itself nothing out of the ordinary weren't it for the tedious assembly. In stead of getting people invested in what is happening with the professor, you just get white flashes alternated with some scenes that do intrigue until they give those again a generic filter you can even make yourself in Windows Movie Maker. When the movie eventually gets into the story it's rushing from one place to the next. If this was an ordinary action movie that would be acceptable, but absolutely not in a Dan Brown movie. The attractive part of Langdon is the puzzle solving, the adventure, the mysteries. Not someone who says:\"Let's go trough this door. I know it is there because I read it in a book.\" The ending is the worst of the whole movie. Again, a lot of action, but that is not what the Dan Brown-series is about. I heard that in the book the ending is totally different and I really wonder why they changed it, but this is a review of a movie and not from the book. So, I have to give the ending the fame of one of the worst endings of 2016 for me. No puzzle, no big reveal, just some action. Overall if you like Langdon and you wished for something like Angels & Demons without the riddles and with even more action than you are at the right place, but that's absolutely not what I wanted or expected from this movie. I wish I could go back to the static, immersive Langdon from The Da Vinci Code who paused here and there and where the history and the characters intrigued him and me.",
         "I watched this film with great expectation having read the book and found it gripping with a superb ending . This film left me totally disappointed , it is so changed from the book I could not believe it. It is the equivalent of making a movie about the second world war where Germany wins.If your going to see this read the book afterwards it is far superior.Why it has been changed so much I have no idea , maybe they don't want to offend the W.H.O or the church .I would like to know if Dan Brown approved of this .It may be they just wanted another run of the mill movie where the American hero always saves the day.We need another film maker to step up and make the real Inferno which tells the story as in the book , sensitive issues and all.",
         "So, Ron Howard, Tom Hanks and Hans Zimmer return for the third movie adaptation of Dan Brown's bestselling symbolist and iconology professional, Robert Langdon. Though we seem to be ironically missing, The Lost Symbol where Langdon tramples over Washington's Masonic history, which is currently in development but with Howard only sitting in a producers chair. Howard's direction, or the editing seems sloppy and rushed with noticeable out-of-sync audio. It shows that they struggled with cramming as much as the butchered novel into the 121min runtime, missing possible reshoots as some of the performances are really not up to scratch, namely Sidse Babett Knudsen and Omar Sy. Hanks, slips into Langdon mode totally as expected and the delightful Felicity Jones plays the Bond-girl style sidekick very well as we watch them try to figure out the same puzzles and twists Langdon is usually pitted against. It's unfortunate that the more I think about it, the more silly the elaborate idea becomes. There's inconsistencies and obvious inaccuracies with the book and I wonder how much power Dan Brown had as executive producer. The story here appears much weaker than the novel, as does some of its characters, especially the reworking of Irrfan Khan's \"Provost\". A lot of the reasonings are just weak and unrealistic which is a shame for something which could actually happen. Zimmer's score is of the recognisable Langdon theme but, it's been digitised adding a terrible technical feel that might accompany a espionage thriller. Again, giving me the assumption that the film was rushed and not the polished film it should have been. What's possibly the biggest disappointment of the film is the factual reality that the story is based on, and as much as we all might like the previous, popular Brown conspiracies, this story is a real looming crisis. It lacks the serious impact the book gives of the current population crisis, the fact that we're nearly 9 billion people on a planet that can currently only support an estimated 4. It fails to question what we should or what would we do in this situation, which we are actually in and is a serious topic for world governments, councils and organisations like WHO. Should we actively do something about population control or let nature take it's natural course. I don't honestly believe this film has audiences going home and taking a long hard think about the issue or the implications of viruses and other methods of population control. The real question being, do we let people die or save as many as we can to keep mankind from extinction. True to most trilogy tragedies, this is certainly the worse of the series so far and I'm hoping The Lost Symbol doesn't fall to the same fate with a rumoured Mark Romanek at the helm. I had low expectations to begin with and unfortunately it didn't hit the mark. Running Time: 6 The Cast: 6 Performance: 6 Direction: 4 Story: 5 Script: 5 Creativity: 7 Soundtrack: 4 Job Description: 3 The Extra Bonus Points: 0 Would I buy the Bluray?: actually yes, only to be part of the series. 46% 5/10",
         "Personally didn't mind 'The Da Vinci Code', though it was a long way from great, but 'Angels and Demons' while with some good things was lacklustre. Unfortunately, the latest film 'Inferno' is no better, in fact all the mistakes made in 'Angels and Demons' are made here and made bigger while a few more grievous ones are made. There is not much that saves 'Inferno', but it does have to be said that the locations are truly stunning with some nice location work that makes one wish that they belonged in a much better film. Hans Zimmer's music score is haunting once again and accentuates the thriller mood of the film, though it was orchestrated more cleverly before. Tom Hanks again gives his role an easy-going charm and effortless authority, there is not much personal at stake seemingly here for Langdon but Hanks is always watchable and gives his all. However, that is pretty much all that was good. As has been said already, the worst thing about 'Inferno' is the ending (which, also agreed, was the thing that elevated the book to a greater level, the ending in the book was that good), rendering everything seen in the film and all the events in the book useless in an ending that felt like a tacked on cop-out that reeked of production/studio interference. This said, the ending doesn't single-handedly bring 'Inferno' down, as there are other just as glaring problems too. Ron Howard's direction is a mess, it is hard to believe that somebody who has a Best Director Oscar and has done some very good to outstanding work directed in a way that suggested more first time director learning (or more like struggling to learn) the ropes, finding urgency is a constant struggle and then he paces things in a rushed and erratic way. Despite the stunning locations and nice location work, 'Inferno' is cheapened by some haphazard editing and over-reliance on high-speed tracking shots that suggest a cinematographer drunk on the job and have a dizzying effect, actually felt rather woozy and sick after seeing the film. Cast-wise, only Hanks rises above his material. Felicity Jones has a very underwritten character with little backstory and incomplete motivations and it shows in delivery and range lacking in expression, a very going-through-the-motions performance. The rest of the cast either overact or are wasted in caricature roles, with no sense of threat present. Further disadvantaging them are a very corny script, with countless lines of clunky and awkward dialogue that sounds confused, overly-condensed and disorganised. Even worse a story that just doesn't compel, with its over-explanatory at times, but even more frequently convoluted, nature, and pacing that is so jumpy but at the same time so pedestrian that there is the sense that the writers and Howard had no idea what to do with the material and when and how to bring urgency into it. On the whole, three or so good things but the rest makes Langdon's hair significantly less floppy in comparison. 3/10 Bethany Cox",
         "Inferno (2016) might have a decent story, acting, characters and even some smart puzzles and original ideas. I wouldn't know and I don't care. This movie sucks regardless of its other merits because a) the direction is somewhere between awful and mediocre. b) the camera work and cinematography is simply said a mess. and c) the editing of this work is nauseous. The editing is so bad it is like a roller coaster ride during which you lose consciousness and see flashbacks of random events while your point of view keeps teleporting to different angles and locations. I have seen better edited Call of Duty meme montage videos on youtube. The flow of this movie makes no sense. Event one, event two, a trip, solve a puzzle. It's like a constantly firing machine gun which misses every shot. I recommend watching this movie solely for the comedic value of the scene where Tom Hank points a visual representation of Dante's Hell and says something like \"here\". Reminded me of those 'yeah it is funny' videos of Gordon Ramsey talking while some other guy edited himself making the actions which Ramsey speaks of.",
         "Soooo. As many others said the ending... SPOILERS: Half through the movie i said to my girlfriend that this probably is the best out of the three movies. I really liked it for a long time. Now i hope word to mouth will result in bad viewer numbers. The best part in the book was the controversial ending. It was thought provoking and refreshingly not the typical happy end. For the whole time of the book zobrist is the bad guy and then in the end you are not so sure because he didn't kill but found an extreme solution. It was a beautiful ending. And they just threw it out the window and changed it to a boring, stereotypical Hollywood endig. WTF??? I was never so disappointed in a movie theater before. They took an easy, safe and horrible path just so people aren't offended... Don't watch it! Don't pay for it! Don' support decisions like this! Pay them a lesson in reviews and with not paying money for this. I feel betrayed and i will write a letter to sony and co.",
         "This review is from the perspective of someone who hasn't read the book but still knows his/her movies. The movie's start is very confusing at first, where Robert Langdon has some visions but they don't really seem necessary and so it takes quite some time to establish the plot. It lacks the inclusion of Renaissance artists' work or a history lesson here or there, they are there, with the main focus on Dante, however it's still not as much as compared to the previous 2 movies, which just made them so much more interesting. There a couple of plot twists in the movie but nothing that might throw you off your seat or make the movie more interesting. Hans Zimmer's background score felt under par compared to the beautiful scores and themes he has given for The Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons and countless other movies. Another thing that I felt lacking was a final turn in the end, like a final nail in the coffin, like the previous 2 movies had. Overall, I don't know about Dan Brown's novel, but the writing of the script was not up to the mark.",
         "What can I say, I was really bored with this movie. There was some aspect of the previous two films in this franchise that I liked. But this had almost nothing going for it, despite the trippy imagery. It just lacked the substance, and clever depth that the previous two films had. This one just appeared like they made it just for the sake of turning the book into a movie. Everything seemed so generic, narrow and boring. This time around it's the same old same old with the character Robert Langdon is once again played by Tom Hanks. This time around another female accommodates him, she is a doctor this time around. While Robert Langdon deals with a clichÃ© case of amnesia. They just seemed like they were on vacation most of the time, instead of it having a rushing, thrilling feel to it. It seemed like the duo was running around solving boring puzzles just for the fun of it. The main leads are once again on the run and a lot of chase scenes ensues which quickly gets boring. With the hitwoman and the feds constantly after them. That is what sums up this movie with the leads just running around, getting chased solving boring puzzles for about an hour and a half way through. Then the last 30 minutes follows the generic pattern, that you as a viewer have seen way too many times in previous other movies. With the good guys trying to dismantle something that is about to go off. I will just say to go rewatch \"Kingsman: The Secret Service\" again. Sure it doesn't take itself seriously as much as this but at least it's way more entertaining. 4.5/10",
         "I rate this the worst mainstream movie I've seen since 'Ashanti' back in 1979. Indescribably bad in every department. The sub James Bond plot is barely comprehensible, the acting all round is atrocious, especially that of Danish actress Sidse Babett Knudsen; the script - risible. Even setting the movie in Florence, Venice and Istanbul is a waste of time since the camera barely lingers long enough for us to appreciate the beauty of these locations. There is a total absence of suspense and we care nothing about any of the characters. This film exhibits everything that is wrong with modern cinema - rapid editing, shaky camera,meaningless noisy soundtrack all designed to create an atmosphere of fake excitement where nothing of any substance exists. It actually occurred to me halfway through that the entire movie was a spoof.",
         "Inferno is the very definition of phoning it in. Everyone in this film looks bored on the verge of tears and you can literally hear Ron Howard off camera counting his money as he sobs into his pillow. No joke, children, it's honestly one of the worst films I have ever seen. Tom Hanks once again returns as Robert Langdon but he left his talent and emotion back at home. No one is here because they want to be. This time he's caught up in an utter gibberish plot concerning a new world-ending plague that makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. There are more holes in this story than there are grains of sand in the Sahara. A special mention of Felicity Jones' \"acting ability\" deserves its own paragraph. This woman had a sub-Hollyoaks level of conviction. She's so breathtakingly hollow and vacant. I have not ever seen such a non-performance in an actual theatrically released film. How on Earth is she expected to carry the next Stars Wars movie? She was beyond beyond terrible. This is a movie that insults and condescends to it's audience at every opportunity. It's not exciting and so far off the mark that it tries to aim for. Inferno is plays out like a bad SyFy movie. I almost think that everyone involved secretly hate Sony and intentionally made a stinker. I chose seeing this over going to the Anime festival. What was I thinking?",
         "First of all I read the book before watching the film. This seems to be significant on how the reviews are made. Like a few others have mentioned on here, the ending is such a disappointment. The book has brilliant twists but the movie is classic simple happy ending. Times are changing and I think people are getting tired of clichÃ© happy endings. Imagine leaving the cinema if the movie ended as the book did. The thought provoking debate that would ensue between watchers would be great. The love story between Langdon and Sinskey isn't needed. I found Vayentha's acting poor. I couldn't buy into Sienna's role.Poor acting? Maybe. I thought people should have died at the end of LOTR and that was over 10 years ago. Too many happy endings for my liking. This movie has betrayed the book to its detriment. Not a happy camper at all.",
         "The movie was good but not good enough as the book was, if you read the book you can imagine a better movie, when the movie started i tried to concentrate on small details which were missing but that was changed when Langdon and sienna have been separated until that point the movie was quite similar to the core concept of the book except that Langdon were able to solve the mystery easily and too fast.. after that point the movie took different direction than Dan brown him self the killing at the end of movie was ejection from Ron Howard in the book they couldn't contend the virus and they were late six days they get there in the last day where the virus became widespread and they couldn't do any thing. sienna was trying to help and she didn't kill any body at the end also she told Dr. Elizabeth Sinskey what is the virus the message of the book wasn't delivered enough the bad part is that maybe some audiences didn't understand the essence of the virus",
         "Directed by Ron Howard, starring Tom Hanks \u2013 looks exciting, gonna be great! What a turd. Take the script basic idea for National Treasure. Toss Jason Borne into the blender. Now add every unrelated plot device in that you can think of. Have them crawling across high beams for no reason that is related to the plot, the search for the McGuffin. Add a plot device of never-ending use \u2013 he's had a head injury and slowly remembers things. And have him go from seriously, noticeably injured to dapper in a new suit after a shower and a few hours \u2013 from unable to stand to doing a tightrope act. Then throw in a stupid plot twist with ten minutes of The Fifth Sense flashbacks explaining what really happened.",
         "I signed in at IMDb because I had to write a review about this movie. It is, in one word, -terrible-. Not only does the director not seem to be able to build up a storyline, but the actors also don't seem to be putting any effort in playing their roles. The movie is boring from beginning to the end. It lacks a storyline, it lacks excitement and it lacks good acting. It was so boring, I fell asleep not once, but twice during the movie! One could probably summarize the movie in only 2 minutes of screen time and you wouldn't miss anything. My advice would be to not spend your hard earned money on this movie, but to go to a near coffeeshop and enjoy a nice cup of coffee with a blueberry muffin instead!",
         "Don't get me wrong the original story is amazing. Many twists in the blot and the ending is superb. This movie decided to ditch all that. It immediately made things clear that W.H.O is trying to capture the professor. And then they decided to add the boring twist of one corrupt agent who wanted to sell the virus as a weapon. The impression I got that the script writer got the news that he has to write the movie script so he bought the book to see what it was about. He started reading the first chapter and drinking his wine along the book to the degree he woke up the next morning with a terrible memory of what he wrote and few notes of the first chapters as he was sober then. He started to make things up and mess with the story till the end which he seems he never even read and thought sure the virus wouldn't spread and kill half the human race!! So the hero saves the day and the villain dies!!!! PS. If u haven't read the end yet pls do yourselves a favor and read the novel. The result were a very detailed ( and longer than it should be) representation of the first chapters then it went into terrible ride. He had to change the amnesia status. The clues and the details of every part of the story. Add a love background between Dr. Langdon and the WHO head. He had to pack the story and cut things because of limited time. Yet many movies reach 3 hours long with no problem. No idea why the makers decided to limit the time to 2 hours. And then fill the space with the repeated scenes in the beginning or add those hideous blots to a great story. Seriously this looks like a 10 year old summary of the novel and he messed the story and altered the end just to fail his friends who had an exam about this novel. 2 stars is more than this piece of mess is worth IMHO."

         "Robert Langdon is in Italy. He wakes up in a hospital with no memory of recent events. He appears to have suffered some head trauma. He's being treated by Dr. Sienna Brooks. Suddenly someone dressed as a policeman comes in and starts shooting, trying to get to Langdon. Brooks helps him. Langdon finds he received an email from a friend in Italy who told him that he too is being hunted, and he's gone into hiding with what they took. Of course he has no idea what he is talking about. He finds something in his belongings that reveals the Map of Hell which is inspired by Dante's Inferno. He learns about a man Bertrand Zobrist, a billionaire who believes the world is too overpopulated and that drastic measures are needed. He plans to release a virus which he created to kill most of the planet's population. Evidently he's inspired by Dante so Langdon needs to find out what he is planning, while he's being pursued by people from the World Health Organization, and one of them is someone he knows.",
         "Wounded by a bullet and suffering from severe memory lapses, Professor Langdon is hospitalised in Florence. Unable to explain his predicament to his attending doctor, Dr Sienna Brooks, the professor is bombarded by hellish visions of eternally damned sinners, and riddled with questions about the events that preceded his accident. Under those circumstances, unknown forces will violently attempt to locate Langdon to retrieve a hi-end, fingerprint-protected container that points to Bertrand Zobrist, a billionaire biomedical engineer, with a vision of a better world which stems from Dante Alighieri's Inferno. Once again on the run with Dr Sienna, the team will try to navigate through the obscure conspiracy that lies before them, attempting to decipher even the slightest of clues, in a wild hunt all over Europe. \"Cerca Trova\" or \"Seek and ye shall Find\"; however, at the end of the line when the search is finally over, what mysteries await?",
         "The geneticist Bertrand Zobrist is hunted down by three men and commits suicide from the top of a tower in Florence. Zobrist believes that the Earth's population that has an exponential growth should be reduced in 50% to save the other 50%. In Florence, Professor Robert Langdon awakens in a hospital with no memory of the last two days and with daydreams and dreadful visions. Dr. Sienna Brooks explains that he has a head trauma cause by a bullet that scratched his head and he would recover his memory in a few days. Out of the blue, a doctor tells that the police wants to interrogate him and a police officer, who is indeed the killer Vayentha, shoots the doctor but Sienna and Langdon succeeds to escape to her apartment. Langdon finds a Faraday pointer in the pocket of his jacket and when they project the image, they see the Map of Dante's Inferno by Sandro Botticelli. They contact the American Consulate but give the wrong address nearby the apartment. Soon the area is under siege of the World Health Organization (WHO) agents and the local police, including Vayentha, and Langdon and Sienna conclude that Zobrist has created a virus to annihilate the world's population. But who can be trusted?",
         "When Robert Langdon wakes up in an Italian hospital with amnesia, he teams up with Dr. Sienna Brooks, and together they must race across Europe against the clock to foil a deadly global plot."
