         "Ramona and Beezus is a 2010 film adaptation based on the book Ramona Forever. Joey King plays Ramona and Selena Gomez plays Beezus. I thought the film was actually quite good and it didn't disappoint me at all. Now a lot of people are going out to see this film because Selena Gomez plays in it. But the real person whom truly shines in this film has to be Joey King. She steals the show from her co-stars and plays Ramona really vividly. This movie is a very fun family movie, and if you have a younger brother or sister, you'd connect right away. I hope IMDb users don't just give this film a 1, because its a children's movie and I hope they see it before they judge. Ramona and Beezus is a small summer flick, that stands short, but proudly with Huge Summer Blockbusters. Highly recommended 8/10",
         "This movie is thoroughly entertaining from beginning to end. I cried for a large portion of it, but not because it was bad, but so full of emotion! My reactions would not have been any different if this were in real life! Joey King is so sweet and Selena Gomez is a perfect depiction of someone her age! Girls cannot go wrong with her as a role model. This movie is extremely true to life, which is not a bad thing at all. It is nice once in awhile to see another family deal with some of the same situations we all do! The movie follows the book very closely and does a great job with it! A must see for everyone (it is not just for girls!)",
         "First Of all this is my very first review so please don't mind anything.And yessss....... I standby my word.Ramona played by \"JOEY KING\" is definitely the \"Sun\" in this movie and the whole universe revolves around her.This girl is very imaginative and artistic who thinks that her family doesn't love her because she is different.But as in real life the movie goes on and she realizes that she really is \"extraordinary\". Every little move that she makes is depicted beautifully in the movie.The Writers & director knew that anything that powerful needs character building and that's exactly what they did.Joey is full of acting genes,she is a natural talent & i have very high hopes for her. So,the cast is superb too..........most of them are whom we know & love.Ramona has a big sister \"Beezus\" played by \"Selena Gomez\"(at-last a big sister who is not \"mean\").The part of the father is played by \"John Corbett\" whom we know from \"United States Of Tara\" & and the mother is lovely \"Bridget Moynahan\".Character of aunt bea is played by \"Ginnifer Goodwin\" and her boyfriend is \"Josh Duhamel\".All of them played their part nicely. I am surprised that this movie hasn't got better ratings on IMDb............i don't know what's happening to people.But don't get put off by that & \"Trust Me\".Every moment of this movie is worth watching and most of all worth enjoying.So get your pop corns and chill a little...........you'll most definitely like it. So peace until next time.",
         "Ramona Quimby (Joey King) lives in a typical middle class neighborhood on the west coast. Her family consists of Father Robert (John Corbett), Mother Dorothy (Bridget Moynahan), big Sister Beatrice, er, Beezus (Selena Gomez) and a new baby sister. Also close to the Quimbys is their mother's sibling, Aunt Bea (Ginnifer Goodwin). Unlike Beezus, who is an excellent student and very mature for a budding teenager, Ramona struggles at school, especially with her no-nonsense teacher (Sandra Oh). The instructor doesn't have much patience with Ramona's penchant to coin new words, among other issues. Life at the house, also, takes a strange turn, when in the middle of home-remodeling project, Dad loses his job. Soon, Mom is working part time at her old job and Pop becomes the lunch packer and house-husband, while sending out a large amount of resumes. Aunt Bea's life, too, receives a curveball when old flame, Hobart (Josh Duhamel) moves back to his original home next to the Quimbys. Happily recovered from the long ago heartbreak of Hobart's abandonment, Bea is startled to find him lavishing attention on her once again. What's a girl to do? Beezus has love trouble, too, when a relationship with longtime pal, Henry Huggins, may turn into a romance. Ramona continues to weather storms, such as the day an egg breaks on her head, minutes ahead of the school pictures! But, biggest problem of all is the fact that they may have to move, if Dad doesn't find a job in town. What will the future bring for the Quimbys? This is very fine family flick, with plenty of humor and energy without any objectionable material. In fact, it is a shining example of how successful a movie can be without sex or bad language. Then, too, the actors do a great job, with King leading the way. What a wholesome and realistic young actress she is! Gomez, too, is a winning and lovely young thespian while Corbett, Moynahan, Oh, Goodwin, Duhamel and all of the others are lively, all-too-human and flat-out fun. The west coast setting is lovely, as are the costumes, script and all other film amenities while the direction is secure and confident. All in all, this film is one every family should have on hand, for repeated viewings, I predict, will never grow old.",
         "When i first got to the theatre to see this movie i wasn't sure if i would like this; but i was wrong. Plot: Young third grader Ramona has a vivid imagination and energy that makes everyone edgy, but she must use her imagination and energy to save the place she loves most. Ramona and Beezus was a lovely film, thanks to the screenplay by Laurie Craig and Nick Pustay. Its was also a lovely film because of the terrific performance by the cast, but mostly by Selena Gomez and Joey King; I felt there emotions, and their stuggles. The humor is what also made the film. There isn't that much humor but just the right amount to make this a feel good movie. This is the perfect family film. Take you kids to see because i promise they will love it.",
         "Ramona and Beezus on the whole was a charming movie. Many kids I know (myself included) loved the Ramona books because she was active, she did things, and things happened because of her. Ramona in the movie had the dramatic flair I always associated with the Ramona of my imagination. The movie was well cast and everyone seemed to fit their character well. That being said, it was a little wordy in places -- Ramona was a do-er not a big-conversation-er! Some of the superfluous talking should have been removed to add in more of Ramona's adventures and take on day to day life. We loved that Ramona's idea of a really bad word was \"guts\"! As a parent I'm grateful that was the only \"bad\" word in the movie! I'm glad my kids saw it, I'm glad we saw it.",
         "This is a film about a family with three daughters: Beezus (teenager), Ramona (9), and Roberta (baby). Ramona's trials and tribulations are central to the plot and are in and of themselves entertaining. What gives the movie heart are the relationships that are woven throughout: Ramona's relationship with each family member, of course, but also the relationship between her Aunt Beatrice and Hobart (an old flame), between Beezus and Henry (childhood pal), and even between Ramona and her teacher, Mrs. Meacham (as a teacher myself, I love this character). The best part of the film is that it all rings true. These people feel like your friends and family. With a few minor exceptions, the acting is very well done. Having watched the movie at the theater with my daughter, I was charmed and wanted my husband to see it. We purchased the DVD when it came out. He loved it as well (even had tears in his eyes a couple of times). It is an excellent family film.",
         "After seeing the trailer I thought the film will be good and to be honest it really did not disappoint me at all. I decided to see this film because i am a fan of both Selena Gomez and Joey King and they both are playing in it. I thought it is movie with Selena as key role. But the actual person who truly steals the show is Joey King. JOEY KING gave an awesome performance as a very funny and extremely creative and imaginative kid girl. I really liked the idea of Ramona as \"guts\" a really bad word..hahhah... lolz! JOEY KING has an extraordinary performance. Selena looks more beautiful in this film. It is really a cute and funny story. It shows the family connections and love among the family members in an awesome manner. Strictly no SPOILERS in the film. COMEDY, ADVENTURE, FANTASY,SENTIMENT, ENTERTAINMENT� what not..!? Everything is in the movie� Not only kids, everybody of any age would like this movie� I loved it..! I am 20 and i like to watch it again...",
         "This movie, based on the books (already this will eliminate 90% of the movie-going audience) by Beverly Cleary, has no explosions, no talking dogs, no cutesy kids who sass their parents and display a maturity rivaling most 30 year olds nor a child with preternatural smarts who ends up preventing nuclear war etc. What it does have is a smart mom, a cool dad, a disaffected teenage sister, a baby, a cool auntie and some normal children. It's a story about a family who struggle with unemployment, job dissatisfaction, marital discord, self esteem, and bad sprinklers, as seen through the eyes of a nine year old girl whose idea of a bad word is \"guts\". Still with me? If you enjoy movies like Iron Giant and quality children's entertainment-you will LOVE this movie. Sadly, the people who complain the loudest about the film industry and the shallow values they encompass will probably miss this one-don't be among them. Take everybody. When I attended, everyone in the audience was clapping and crying at the end of the film , children and adults alike. Yes, it's a \"little film\"-meaning there are no blue aliens, no 3d stun shots, no cartoon characters passing off moral pablum as deep though. What it is a sweet story about real people. I wish there had been more people of color in the film, but I'll settle for some fantastic actors and a lovely message. See it and tell all your friends.",
         "I went to see it twice at two different theaters and one thing I noticed was that all the kids watching the movie actually watched it. Large numbers of kids in each theater and it was quiet until there was a time for a gasp or a laugh. The parents that I talked to after each movie had nothing but good things to say and the general consensus was that they were happy to see such a feel good family friendly movie making it to theaters. Why can't Hollywood realize that the desensitizing of the masses has gone on long enough. I realize it's all about the money and not the craft anymore but movies like this one restore my faith. Elizabeth Allen really did pull the characters out of everyone's performances. Ramona played by Joey King was exactly like I envisioned her when I read these books. Daydreaming her way through life but with such a big heart. Very surprised with the versatility of Selena Gomez. Definitely more than just a Disney princess. The interaction between Ramona and Beezus was angry, happy, sad, compassionate but most of all love. Josh Duhamel was dreamy and I saw a side of him I didn't think existed. Ginnifer played such a fun and sweet middle sister aunt. I really liked the little interactions with her and Ramona. John and Bridget were perfect as Mom and dad. They were like real parents dealing with real issues. I honestly had tears of joy and sadness, I laughed, but was always watching the screen. I really hope this movie does well and warrants more like it to be made. Sorry for lack the of punctuation but this is the internet and not school :) I totally recommend this to anyone who has a heart and wants to just see a feel good fun movie."
