      "synopsis": "On an alternate world, in the Second Age the Order, a desperate alliance of men, elves and dwarves are led and advised by prophets. Together they finally end the war against the orcs and dark elves. As the Order struggles to restore civilization, an ancient evil is rekindled in the Western lands. Operatives of a syndicate of conspirators known as The Shadow emerge from the lawless borderlands. The Order dispatches agents of its own to discover the origin and intentions of The Shadow Cabal. Meanwhile, in the wastelands the elven bounty huntress Nemyt Akaia (Danielle Chuchran) has been looking for the fugitive orc bandit Fangtor Bloodmoon (Adam Abram). Fangtor is shaman, a dragon rider. Using a ballista Nemyt shoots down the monster and its rider but Fangtor survives the crash. After an intense fight Nemyt cuts off his head. In death Fangtor curses Nemyt with the mark of The Shadow Cabal, which appears as a black sigil on her left forearm. Keltus (Richard McWilliams), also known as Wanderer, an agent of the Order and ambassador of the Prophetess of Arialia (Bailee MyKell Cowperthwaite), tracks the dwarf Gyarmuck (James C. Morris) to his cave seeking information about the Shadow. Unfortunately, Gyarmuck is already serves the Cabal and the two battle. Gyarmuck brags that the God of Death will awaken a few days hence and that using mystic vessel, to be delivered by Kullimon's raiders, not even the Gods will be able to stand against the power of the Shadow. Having told us what we need to know, Gyarmuck tries to kill Keltus with a homemade bomb, but the explosion blows off his arm and apparently kills him. Elsewhere, orc raider Kullimon The Black (Paul D. Hunt), finds out that the orc horde he has been leading has attacked a human friary, strictly against his orders. Moreover, the leader of the raid is his first deputy Mulgrut (Kyle Paul), who is working for a shadow agent. Kullimon tells the orcs that he has always wanted his men to be honorable warriors and not thieves or murderers. But Mulgrut divides the horde with promises of wealth. Disgusted, Kullimon and his loyal orcs attempt to leave, but they are attacked by Mulgrut's traitors orcs. Kullimon alone survives and is taken prisoner. Keltus, not knowing what to do next prays to his prophetess to report his findings and to get new orders. The prophetess tells him that the Gods are preparing their return but that they must not succeed. If the death god Goth Azul is unleashed from the underworld, life will end. She informs Keltus that General Drennon (Danny James) keeps a Shadow agent in his outpost's dungeon. Keltus' mission is to question him by any means necessary to get new information. Nemyt enters that outpost just before Keltus. He sees that the elf is cursed and follows her but Nemyt only wants her bounty for Fangtor's head. Drennon dismissively refuses to pay the full amount offering a lesser sum instead. Enraged, Nemyt replies that she should more rather than less for having been cursed and demands a cleric to remove the black sigil. The mark can't be removed, Drennon replies, in fact, she will now be considered a Shadow agent. His men seize her. Nemyt puts up a good fight but is finally knocked out and put into jail. Keltus now enters Drennon's office and they discuss the problem that dwarves, and now even elves, are being drafted into the Shadow Cabal. Keltus asks to interrogate the imprisoned Shadow agent Maggut Gulbrow (James C. Morris) as soon as possible. In the jail Nemyt has been chained in the same cell as Maggut. He becomes impressed that an elf is now a part of the Cabal. He confides in her, revealing that if she is able to get free she must retrieve a box of gold and take it to Garret's Crossing at a specific time. There she must exchange the gold with Kullimon's raiders for the sacred vessel, an artifact the Shadow is seeking. Nemyt asks where she can find the gold and Maggut tells her that she can find it close to the bleeding stone. She must also collect the blood from the altar but only at dawn. When Nemyt asks, where the bleeding stone is Maggut becomes suspicious that maybe the elf is a spy. As a Shadow agent Nemyt should already know the place. Maggut tries to kill her, but he is no match for the huntress. Keltus enters the cell and finds Maggut's body and asks Nemyt if Maggut spoke before he died, but the elf refuses any answer. Changing his tactics he takes her into his custody by authority of the prophetess. The duo is stopped by a veiled woman (Eve Mauro) with a handcart as they prepare to leave. The woman tells Keltus that death is upon him, that a hero is known by his deeds but is judged by his heart. She asks him who his heart belongs to and leaves. Once in the wilderness Keltus takes off Nemyt's handcuffs,but the elf attacks knight immediately. To quiet her, Keltus assures Nemyt that a priestess of the Order will remove the mark IF Nemyt is willing to help him infiltrate the Shadow. Knowing that the mark will kill her at some point, she agrees and tells Keltus, that they have to go the bleedng stone. On the way Keltus learns that Nemyt is a high elf of the GaruunDan, who survived the Orc Wars as a child.explaining her violent hatred of orcs. Crossing forest they discover Kullimon tied to a cross but still alive. The elf wants to kill him, but Keltus stops her and frees the Orc in exchange for information. Kullimon tells them that Mulgrut has attacked a monastery of mendicants to steal the bone-vessel for the Shadow. The artifact contains the holy ashes of Amun-Khan. Disbelieving, Keltus asks for the place of the exchange. Kullimon offers to take them there to get his revenge on Malgrut, but Nemyt reveal the place and time--Garret's Crossing at new moon. Kullimon notices the elf's mark of the elf, refuses accompany them any longer inciting Nemyt to attack him. The fight ends in a draw. Keltus, acting as mediator, gets them to agree to work together for the common good. Together they reach the Bleeding Stone, an ancient meeting place for warlocks. Nemyt tells the others that she is supposed to collect the blood dripping from it. Kullimon thinks that it must be important for the Shadow. Keltus decides they might need the blood at some point of their mission. While they wait Nemyt sneaks away to collect Maggut's gold, hidden close by. In her absence a horde of undead and an Abomination attack her two companions, wounding Keltus. They are outnumbered and held by the hulking monster. Upon Nemyt's return the undead stop fighting, recognizing her as one of them. Kullimon takes advantage of the respite and kills the monster. Nemyt kills all the rest. Keltus discovers the gold, enraging the elf again. She asks, if the prophetess will really able to help her. Keltus affirms his previous statement, calming Nemyt. He sees that she is beginning to change. They collect the blood and leave to Garret's Crossing. Kullimon expresses the thought that Nemyt must be evil since she was cursed and the Shadow can only claim souls, which are filled with murder and hatred. But Keltus defends Nemyt. He tells the orc about Fangtor's fate, his curse for Nemyt and also that Nemyt is a child of the GaruunDan. Kullimon understands, and is also thankful, that she killed the shaman, since Fangtor turned Malgrut evil. At Garret's Crossing they wait for Malgrut's orcs, who should bring them the bone-vessel. Keltus wants Nemyt to pretend that she is the Shadow agent, who is buying the vessel with Maggut's gold. After the exchange the Order should destroy the bone-vessel. Without the two others knowing Keltus prays again to his prophetess to report his findings and his plan. He tells the prophetess that he promised, that a priestess of the Order will remove Nemyt's mark. The prophetess disagrees and orders Keltus to kill Nemyt, when she gets useless. As a murderer and servant of Goth Azul she has to die. Keltus agrees. When the orcs arrive, Nemyt meets them at the crossing. Mulgrut is sceptical, but the elf can persuade him with the gold and her sword to make the exchange. Just when she is leaving, the real Shadow agent appears, and the orcs stop Nemyt, wounding her seriously. The agent takes the vessel, curses the orcs and tells them to come to the Dimwood pass. Then he leaves. Mulgrut is happy about being immortal now and serving the Shadow. The orcs leave for the Dimwood pass together with the injured and captivated Nemyt. Keltus decides to follow the agent for the vessel, while Kullimon wants to follow the orcs. The orc is disapointed, that Keltus is leaving Nemyt to a terrible fate after she did her part to help him. Keltus excuses his behaviour with his responsibility to the prophetess. Keltus can catch up with the Shadow agent, who tells the knight, that he will belong to Goth Azul, since his soul is empty. Keltus wants the vessel back and attacks the agent. He loses and is stabbed. In addition he is cursed with the mark and unable to attack the agent any longer, since his faith is too weak. The agent goes away with the blood and the vessel, leaving Keltus to die and to become an undead servant of Goth Azul. Keltus prays to his prophetess to save him, but she and their goddess turn him down and forget him. Meanwhile Kullimon gets closer to Mulgrut's horde. He has to cross a lake and is nearly killed by evil mermaids. Mulgrut's horde is taking a break, and Mulgrut wants to abuse and torture the captive Nemyt. Kullimon arrives just in time, challenges Mulgrut and kills his former captain. He refuses the cursed horde, and tells them that his revenge is now complete. Mulgrut suddenly comes back to life. As a shadow warrior he can't be killed, he explains. Kullimons frees Nemyt and wants to leave. But the elf wants her sword, takes a knife from Kullimon and runs to the horde. She stabs Kethku (James Gaisford), Malgrut's captain, several times insanely, since that orc hurt her badly at Garret's Crossing and also intended to abuse her. She gets to her sword, kills many more orcs and leaves with a bewildered Kullimon. During their escape she is shot in the back, but Kullimon carries her and they can escape. Keltus is dying. The veiled woman with the handcart approaches him and tells him that he is now so very alone with an empty heart. She drops her cloak and reveals that she is a prophetess of the goddess Tarsa or even Tarsa herself, the god of light. She explains Keltus, that she is his oldest and only friend, that she has been watching and judging him, but that he is unable to defeat Goth Azul. She claims Keltus as her own and explains that Goth Azul has no power over the living. She takes his arm and enchants him. Kullimon is taking care of Nemyt's wound, while she is unconcious. She awakes and is disappointed that Keltus is not there. Kullimon admires Nemyt's resistance to the curse and is sad, that his men are lost to the Shadow. Nemyt offends the other orcs again, but she admits, that not all of them seem to be bad. She thanks Kullimon for saving her and wants to go after the Shadow. Kullimon insists on helping her. On their way to Dimwood Pass they are ambushed by the dwarf Gyarmuck, who did not die in the explosion during his fight with Keltus. Nemyt and Kullimon are not able to defeat the heavily armed dwarf. Nemyt is nearly killed and unconcious, while Kullimon is defenseless. The dwarf wants to kill Kullimon, but is beheaded by Keltus. Keltus heals Nemyt's wounds with his magic given by Tarsa. He admits, that he was wrong about her, and that he lied, when he said, that her mark can be healed. Nemyt does not get angry and promises to resist the curse as long as possible. Keltus explains, that when the Shadow mixes the ashes and the blood at the pit of demons, an entrance to the underworld, an avatar of Goth Azul will arise to lead an unstoppable undead army. Nemyt leads the trio to the pit for their final battle. The elf notices that Keltus has changed, and he confesses that he now follows Tarsa and shows his new mark of light. Nemyt gets hurt by the sight, but Keltus tells her that there is still hope for her to be healed. At the pit of demons they decide a suicide mission to stop the ritual. While Kullimon and Keltus should distract the horde, Nemyt should approach the Shadow agents and steal the ashes or the blood to stop the ceremony. Nemyt wants Keltus to swear to kill her, if the curse overtakes her. Nemyt and Kullimon shake hands. She tells Kullimon that her vengeance on the orc kind is satisfied. She is happy that she did not kill him and leaves for the pit. Nemyt is able to get close to the agents and the ceremony. Mulgruts detects her, when Kullimon and Keltus start their attack. The elf leaves her cover and wants to attack the agents, but the main agent is able to intensify her curse and orders the elf to commit suicide with her own sword. Suprisingly she is still strong enough to resist, but is shot by Mulgrut in her side. The ceremony continues and the blood is spilled into the pit. Mulgrut tortures Nemyt again, but Kullimon can get Mulgrut away from her. Nemyt gets angry again, pulls out the bolt and starts killing the agents in the ceremony. While Keltus is still fighting the horde, Kullimon cuts of Mulgrut's head, killing him once and for all. In the meantime Nemyt got to the final main Shadow agent and forces her sword into his head. In death the agent pulls the sword out, strikes Nemyt seriously and falls into the pit together with the ashes. The remaining horde stops attacking, and Kullimon helps Nemyt. She tells him that she failed, but the Orc calms her down and tells her that it is now Keltus' turn. The avatar of Goth Azul rises and starts killing everyone with a large black spear of shadow. Keltus stabs the monster with his sword but without effect. The avatar sends another spear after Keltus but misses. The knight picks up the spear and with Tarsa's magic it turns into a spear of light. Keltus throws the spear right into Goth Azul's chest and destroys the monster. Keltus finds Nemyt and Kullimon and notices that Nemyt's marks is gone and that she is now free. Nemyt dies in Kullimon's arms. Keltus prays to Tarsa to give Nemyt back, and the elf comes back to life. Nemyt picks up Mulgrut's gold and they leave the battlefield, discussing how to split the money,",

         "\"Don't expect a blockbuster\" ... that is the main comment I have read now in the last days about SAGA. That is true, but you should simply not care, if you like Fantasy and Independent Films like me. With the low budget (I would really like to know how much it was?) the producers did a great job. Arrowstorm Entertainment and Mainstay Productions are small companies: They are making movies for fans, all sorts of short movies in different genres and offer young talents a chance to contribute their ideas. Originally SAGA was considered as a Webseries and they did a short movie, which is now the first scene. That was a test for the concept, shot in one day with almost no budget in Snow Canyon State Park. It worked out and they collected enough money (also from fans via Kickstarter) to make this movie. And it is very entertaining with even some funny moments. The costumes are very good in my opinion, especially the ones for the orcs. I like the music and also the fighting scenes. I would really like to see a sequel with our heroes. So give it a try! You will like the ears of that blue-eyed sword swinging elf. For me it's a 8/10, including a bonus for the elf, the main orc :-) and for the fantastic evolution of this project.",
         "I visit IMDb for several years, but this is the first film I really feel the urge to comment on around here. I stumbled about \"Dragon Lore/Curse of the Shadow/The Shadow Cabal\" by pure chance (I think it was the lead Elf's iconic mask that initially caught my attention). The story itself isn't something to write home about, but isn't inferior to the stuff one gets served in most of the shiny Hollywood productions either. A High Elven bounty hunter, a human cleric/paladin and an Orc war chief team up -- more or less reluctantly -- to defeat the malevolent Order of the Shadow, which disciples plan to summon and materialise their demon master, the death god Goth Azul. Nothing new here. No, the strong points of \"The Shadow Cabal\" (I'll stick with this title) lie within other fields. In some parts the film is wonderfully trashy, but more than once we are granted well done sceneries, e.g. the vision sequences or the Orc's boating trip. It is also the Orc that is the trio's most entertaining one, thanks to the actor's solid performance. The Elf, Nemyt, is established as a likable \"bad girl\", albeit with an irritating habit for spitting (and sexy \"Underworld\" contact lenses). She has got an impudent attitude, indulges in animalistic hissings at times, but turns out to be loyal to the good side. Last but not least, she is pleasant to behold. Which leaves us with the paladin: He stays slightly anaemic, partly because he hasn't got as many strong scenes as the other two lead characters. Digital effects are scarce, yet (or therefore) the final boss is rather impressive for an indie film. Furthermore, there is many a scene that sports a downright surreal atmosphere (for example the happenings at the Bleeding Stone). The locations are generally well chosen, but the footages of the Grand Canyon and other recognisable sites work against the immersion into a fantasy world. Make-up and props look good, often really good. However, the main Orc needs a nose job -- right now he reminds me of the Grinch. The fighting scenes are mostly solid and never overdone. To top it off, there are a lot of lovely details, such as Nemyt's aforementioned mask. Unbiased, this film would get a seven. But the indie bonus makes it an eight out of ten, hands down.",
         "This movie was surprisingly good. The story is relatively simple, but the interesting characters (especially the orc, Kullimon, \"ha ha ha\") along with great music and pictures made it work. It's not as \"shiny\" and overdone as Hollywood products and I think that's its biggest strength. Special effects (which are very good for a low budget production) were kept to the scenes where it makes sense and not used carelessly. The landscape and scenery are so much better than anything you're used to from big movies, because it's actually real and not 50% CGI. It doesn't look oversaturated and edited, but really natural, which adds a lot of immersion that most movies are lacking nowadays. Overall it's a really nice movie and I can definitely recommend it to people who like the genre.",
         "This was really a surprise of a movie. \"SAGA: Curse of the Shadow\" is somewhat of a mixture between \"Lord of the Rings\" and \"Dungeons & Dragons\". And if you enjoy high adventure, sword and sorcery, or enjoy (or ever have) playing Dungeons & Dragons, then chances are very likely that you will enjoy this movie as well. The storyline in \"SAGA: Curse of the Shadow\" is rather interesting, especially because it is well thought through, and director John Lyde did a good job in managing to entangle the threads of the three different tales of the three main characters; the elf Nemyt (played by Danielle Chuchran), the human Keltus (played by Richard McWilliams) and the orc Kulliman (played by Paul D. Hunt). Without getting too much into fleshing out the actual storyline, I will just quickly skim it and summarize. The story is about three unlikely adventurers who have to join forces against an awakened evil that threatens the entire land. The storyline is actually quite much like something you would find in most high adventure tales of sword and sorcery; it is something taken right out from a Dungeons & Dragons game. And I love it. It was so cool. Sure this wasn't as grand and epic on the same scale as \"The Lord of the Rings\" movies - given they were on two entirely different budgets. But \"SAGA: Curse of the Shadow\" actually fared better, much better, than all of the three \"Dungeons & Dragons\" movies that are out on the movie market so far. The acting in the movie was quite good. And the above three mentioned actress and actors did good jobs with their given characters, and they also fared well in the combat and melee situations, which just improved the enjoyment of the movie quite a lot. As far as costumes went, then \"SAGA: Curse of the Shadow\" had some pretty nice touches to the costumes and the make-up of the various creatures and characters. It was all quite believable, and it worked out quite well. However, one thing that didn't sit well with me, was the sounds like roaring and growling lions that the orcs had to make. Yeah, I get that they are of savage minds, but come on, those sounds were just a bit too much. Another great treats for fans of the fantasy genre and people who enjoy the Dungeons & Dragons games. In \"SAGA: Curse of the Shadow\" you will see humans, dwarfs, elves, orcs, mermaids/sirens, dragons, zombies, a minotaur, and even two deities. The movie was beautifully shot, with lots of good camera work. And there was a lot of visual treats for the eyes from the various locations and scenery found throughout the movie. \"SAGA: Curse of the Shadow\" is highly recommendable if you enjoy adventures, sword and sorcery, or if you are fan of the fantasy genre in general. I enjoyed this movie tremendously, and was totally caught off guard at how cool this movie turned out to be.",
         "Given the nature of the film, the content and the advertising - I admit I was inclined to watch it anyways. However reading some of the comments here I got the impression this was a film over-looked by the normal mass viewer. Fortunately I did watch it and I agree with things expressed here so far. The film is so natural feeling, yet with a hint of amateur innocence. Great set pieces, costumes, scenery. The dialogue is acceptable, the pace is quick and the direction is clear. I only wish it was longer or a part of a larger series. If this is what 'Indie' can do on a budget, I'm hopeful for the future of B films.",
         "I saw this film accidentally, with zero warning, so to speak. It looked as if it was interesting enough, so after watching the trailer and a bit of pondering, I decided to go and check it out. (Besides, I tend to enjoy watching bad films - I saw Uwe Boll's \"Alone in the Dark\" after reading all the bad reviews - so nothing could go wrong, right?) And yes, nothing went wrong, I actually quite enjoyed the film. Yes, it was a bit cheap and the (sparingly used) CGI weren't top quality, but that's quite understandable given the film's limited budget. The music was very nice, and the costumes were spot-on, with the orcs looking quite good. (Fun fact: There were more fantastic races in this film than there were humans.) Speaking about the races though, the film certainly reminds more of WarCraft III than of Tolkien, but it only \"reminds\", nothing more. We didn't see a lot of dwarfs, unfortunately. The story was reasonably good and the action scenes were abundant. I'd have loved more character development and more introduction to the world (the first 10-15 minutes of the film were mostly swordfights), but it works as it is. The film is gripping and interesting enough, and worth a watch. Just don't expect something too amazing. It seems to be based on a video game and I've heard rumours about other films (or TV series? I'm not certain, sorry) in the same universe, which I'd certainly give a shot to as well. A solid 6/10 from me, but it's very near to the 7. NB: Note that there is some blood and a bit of gore in this film, which some viewers might find displeasing.",
         "A pretty well done fantasy film of mythical characters and magic powers. The actors played their roles nicely. With suiting effects and suiting costumes the movie introduces the viewer in that world of legend. I would say the movies was better than most Hollywood movies. The whole crew that done this movie did a very well job; The orcs looked vividly orc-ish and the elf girl has played her part well. And of course the human hero was no less impressive. The story was not amazing, but was good enough thanks the writers. I will give it a well deserved 7 out of 10. Despite the low budget the movie was surprisingly decent.",
         "This is the first time i've been compelled to write on IMDb. If you're a lover of Sci fantasy and like me feel starved of decent movies in our favourite genre then give this a watch. I only wish that this movie had been given the budget that some of the garbage that has been delivered over the last few years has received. Well done to all for this gem. I would hope that a sequel is in the planning and please keep the 3 main leads as i imagine that they received a small fee for this movie due to the budget but still delivered a performance that deserves another outing.",
         "This was much better than I expected it would be. I was expecting a trashy B movie but this was much better than that. The first 15 minutes are a bit of a whirlwind, you get thrown right into the story, this could be a good thing, but also to an extent you kind of feel like you are watching the second half of a film and have missed the scenes where they introduced these characters. The main Orc was excellent - he was by far the most physically convincing in the action scenes, and had some of the funniest lines as well. The CGI was budget limited but was perfectly acceptable. The hero and the elf were both acceptably done. The acting in general was much better than you'd normally get in this genre of film.",
         "I will watch just about anything with swords, dragons, and magic. So I was kind of curious to see what this movie was. I was mildly entertained because right off the battle scenes were poorly choreographed. Storyline fell short of what I would have liked it to. But as a writer that is what gets me naturally. I think they just kind of took a bunch of elements together and threw it into a pot and called it a story. Dry cereal. But if you are into sword and sorcery like I am then you can say this movie has not progressed since the same movies in the genre of the 80s. Still worth a watch if you aren't lactose intolerant because it comes with cheese. I will say they had a nice element with the green screen and the makeup was nicely done. Honestly visually for a Bmovie I was into it, but somewhere the story fell short and the flow of the action wasn't there.",
         "Somewhere in time and space, there is a battle between the evil and the good. The Prophets of The Order are trying to restore civilization while The Shadow is trying to revive the God of Death. The female elf bounty hunter Nemyt Akaia (Danielle Chuchran) fights against the criminal Fangtor Bloodmoon (Adam Abram) and kills him. However she is cursed by him with the Shadow mark on her wrist. When she goes to the nearby castle to collect her reward, she is arrested because of the mark and sentenced to death. Meanwhile the human Ambassador of Light Keltus the Wanderer (Richard McWilliams) chases the dwarf Gyarmuck (James C. Morris) to find the real intentions of the Shadow and he learns that the orcs have a powerful vessel that they will sell to the Shadow representative. Keltus heads to the castle where Nemyt is imprisoned and he finds that she has discovered where the orcs are going. He brings her with him to seek out the horde of orcs and promises that the Prophetess would help her to get rid off her mark. On the beginning of their journey they find Kullimon the Black (Paul D. Hunt) that was left behind tied up to two trees by his former horde after being betrayed by the orc Mulgrut (Kyle Paul). The unlikable trio teams up in a journey to avoid that the God of Death returns life and destroys civilization. \"SAGA \u2013 Curse of the Shadow\" is a low-budget adventure in a magic world of elves, orcs, dragons and forces of light and shadows. The story is rushed in the beginning certainly due to the budget constraint and the screenplay is uneven. The choreography of the many fights is terrible, the repetitive music score is annoying and the acting is reasonable only. But the flick is watchable in a rainy day afternoon. My vote is six. Title (Brazil): \"SAGA \u2013 A Maldição das Sombras\" (\"SAGA \u2013 Curse of the Shadow\")",
         "Dragon Age Dawn Of The Seeker was quite a good movie, for its Budget it has much better Special Effects than some of those horrible Sci-Fi movies being released lately, the cinematography of the landscapes and scenery was amazingly beautiful, you really do not expect it for the budget, the Elves, Orcs, Dwarfs, Mermaids, Sirens, Dragons and the rest where very good, their make up was pretty Amazing, the Orcs look similar to the Orcs in Lord of the Rings and they even carried over the Orc music from Lord of the Rings with a few differences, probably to protect them from Copyright. The acting in this movie was Fair to Good, the combat and Melee fighting scenes were pretty poor, but you can get passed the poor fighting scenes as the movie is engaging and you do still want to watch it till the end.",
         "Objectively, this is a low-budget movie with high-quality make-up, choreography and photography. Fighting scenes, costumes/scenery and background music lacks nothing. It is engaging in image as it is in dialogue. It correlates completely with what you would expect from a fantasy/adventure book/movie. The enactment of different races, the small racial details that are so well synergized between actor and environment is perfect. Subjectively, i thought this movie had so many details about races, so well executed, that it surpassed the performances of any orc/elf/human fantasy actors in any other low-budget movie in the genre. Its a story that doesn't have to explain the universe it unravels in, as the story itself and its characters will all alone enthrall you with all the glorious adventure-feel that you love so much. Recommended to all fantasy fans.",
         "For a low budget movie it certainly impressed me more than I hoped. Really, REALLY beautiful scenery, good cast (main trio), high-quality make-up and costumes (the elf girl is just a perfect elf, never saw better in any movie). The plot is a canon fantasy, nothing too original, but I wasn't bored by it. Fighting scenes were generally good I didn't had much expectations from the beginning, so for the scenery alone I could give it a 10 easily (and for Danielle Chuchran, of course). But I must be fair - some special effects were too cheap for this kind of beautiful environment, I'm not into the fancy graphics, but the dissonance was just too strong. The final battle was lame and plot has its issues. All in all, it is a \"must see\" for any fantasy fan.",
         "You know when you play some fantasy game and you have the mythical creatures, the complex script, the compelling battles and you think to yourself \"If only they would make movies like that!\". That's exactly how Curse of the Shadow feels! The movie starts with a battle between a dragon riding Orc shaman and an Elven bounty huntress. There are no moving camera effects, no cheesy dialogues, no pompous and ridiculous fighting like in Xena, but a fight that is believable and lasts for more than five minutes. I knew I was going to like this movie just from the attention that this first fight scene got from the creators. The rest is a classic fantasy quest, where the unlikeliest of allies - a Human cleric, an Orc chieftain and the Elven bounty huntress - battle the growing threat of evil. There were scenes that seemed a bit off, but not many. I was inclined to rate this a 10 just because I couldn't think of any scenes that I didn't enjoy or felt they were not part of the story. The battles are well done, the make up professional, the acting top notch - and you have to take into account that these are no name actors with a few films like Osombie in their belt - and the story doesn't feel like it was written by a kindergarten child. All in all, don't expect anything else than a good fantasy quest film, but it was thankfully and unexpectedly good. I can't wait for the next SAGA movie.",
         "I know. I should be tolerant: This is a low budget movie. The photography is quite good, and the attention to detail in makeup, props and clothing is actually better than I expected. But I resisted only an hour before I turned it off. I never could believe and transport into the story. The elf girl snarls all the time and all of them act as if all their stereotype words had a profound meaning. The music is Wagnerian even when actors climb a little hill or pass the salt. The screenplay just hops along as a succession of badly sewed scenes. I think there is potential. I really do. But the whole crew and cast need honest feedback to be able to correct their shortcomings. They should be encouraged, but they're far from being there yet.",
         "I'll say this right off the bat: This is a low-budget film, and it can't be entirely faulted for that. The kind of pitfalls you would expect from a low-budget movie are all here: Cheesy effects, poor makeup, limited sets, over-processed visuals (as a result of limited sets). Normally, these things would be forgivable if the acting, story, choreography, and cinematography outshine them. In this case, they simply do not. Everything you see in the first 5 minutes lets you know exactly what you're in store for. A terrible CGI dragon is being ridden by an orc in very unconvincing makeup. The orc is shot down by an elf with the cheapest color contact lenses this side of your local mall, and a fight scene ensues. This is where you see the combination of poor direction and framing coupled with extremely inept choreography. Hell, there's a point in the first fight scene where you can CLEARLY see the elf MISS her kick to the orc's face by about a foot, and he still grunts and flies backwards as if it connected. That's the kind of thing you either re-shoot or cut in post. This is the kind of quality you might expect to find in a feature-length YouTube production -- though that might be insulting to some of the more accomplished YouTube content producers.",
         "Started watching this movie and was already disappointed with it within the first 10 minutes. However I was determined to see it through to the end hoping it might pick up and get a bit better. I was wrong. The scenes are boring, and clearly shot on the same set with minimal changes. The story line is difficult to follow and thought the movie it is unclear what they are actually trying to achieve. The only thing we know is they are trying to defeat the 'dark shadow'. This pretty much includes a whole bunch of staged fights which are very unexciting using a lot of careless spins and tricks instead of it actually looking like a proper fight. Kudos to the outfits they may be the only good bit of this movie. I would definitely not recommend this, even if you have seen lord of the rings, stick to that for a fantasy thriller.",
         "My first review of a movie. Was surprised by how good this movie was. I have seen a few B fantasy movies and this is a one of the few good ones. I like the characters and the details of the outfits and makeup. The fight scenes are also good (for a B movie) but they do use a few tricks like fast-forwarding on a few of them. I think they use the same settings a few times but since it is a B movie it is expected. It is a movie you can watch an afternoon when you have nothing to do and it will keep you entertained if you don't want to watch something too serious.",
         "It's as another user described it much better than expected. That doesn't make it really good though. The expectations were low and it didn't fall below them. Since the movie does not have a lot of money (see CGI), it does do the neat trick of keeping most of the story on the road. Or in the woods would be a better description, where you have the possibility not to show any technology at all. Acting is decent for what the movie is. The story of a group that doesn't really belong together but has to stick with each other is old, but has some charm. If you rent the Disc make sure to watch the Outtakes, it's obvious they had fun making it and I think it would be too harsh and unfair to criticize the movie too much",
         "For the life of me I can not understand the low rating this movie has. If you loath all the CGI over the top Movies. This movie is for you. If you prefer characters in really good costumes. This movie is for you. If you prefer monsters that fight back. This movie is for you. If you prefer really good fight scenes. This movie is for you. Hands down one of my favorite movie finds of the year. It blends great fight scenes with a lot of different races and considering it had a smidget of the Lord of the BORING's budget, it still produced a far better movie. PLEASE MAKE A SEQUEL!!!",
         "Awesome. As good as cheap gets, in my opinion. Admittedly, the rating is overwhelmingly due to the chick protagonist because 1) she's hot, 2) she's hot in a slightly exotic way, and 3) she puts on better fight choreography than just about anybody I've seen in *any* movie, low budget or not. Casting above & beyond the rest, really. As for the rest of the movie, at least serious effort was made to make it look good... in fact, much of it was just plain beautiful. Which kind of kills the rationalizations that people are making for some of the sub-par crap being wheeled out in the new Star Wars cash cow of a steamroller, for example (apparently $200,000,000 wasn't enough to iron out the kinks on some of their rushed effects). So yeah, the story is irrelevant and plenty of it looks *beyond* dopey, but you really couldn't ask for much more from such a comparatively minor project.",
         "I am writing this in 2015 and Arrowstorm Entertainment as well as Splendid Films (Mainstay Productions for this piece) are getting a reputation for being masters of good, low-budget films. One of their first films was this piece, SAGA: Curse of the Shadow, which is a story of a rebellious bounty hunter she-elf that finds herself, unwittingly at first, within the mix of a motley crew (paladin and orc) that ends up saving the world while looking past their differences and becoming the best of friends. Yes, it is low budget so the CG, by today's standards, is sub-par. But, if watchers can get out of their visual-dependent box and take in all that matters in terms of movies, then this movie certainly stacks up to be... dare I say, \"excellent\"? I never thought I would like B-movies until I saw the several from Splendid films and Arrowstorm Entertainment. SAGA: Curse of the Shadow has a strong storyline, solid character development, well-done environments/scenery, REALLY good soundtrack (and they mix the music well). The music by Panu Aaltio really adds a lot to this piece. I highly recommend this film if you are out to be entertained. That is what movies really are for, aren't they?",
         "As some of the other reviewers have said this is good. There is some dross out there, but this was good quality Sword and Sorcery. Made very much on a shoestring, by a 'repertory company' of actors, actresses, and crafts people, but despite that, overall, it was entertaining, the script worked, the VFX were functional and not over-powering, and the actors delivered good performances. Costuming in particular worked well and weaponry - one of my pet hates is stupid swords, and the ones in Saga - the Shadow Cabal, are nice bits of cutlery, good functional swords. There are somethings that could have been done better - some of the fights sequences are little bit over choreographed, and someone tell the extras to stop all that swaying, but I reckon it's well worth effort.",
         "Having watched pretty much every fantasy film ever made, Curse of the Shadow is surprisingly good. Although fairly low-budget, with no major actors to speak of, it makes up for this with extremely good photography, outstanding make-up effects and exciting action scenes. The effects are also quite good. Vivid CGI depicts dragons, wyverns and other fantastic beasts. Dialogue is a stilted at times and the simplistic story becomes overly complicated. The story could have used more fleshing out and less annoying dialogue scenes that just stand to pad out of the story. Danielle Chuchran is surely and one-note as the elven bounty hunter, while most of the film's genuine moments come from Richard McWilliams as the cleric warrior. American actors seem to be unable to take this type of fantasy seriously and end up looking like they are in a bad LARP adventure. All in all, this movie was reasonably entertaining. Well crafted and done with obvious affection for the genre. Check it out if you have a chance."
