         "I loved this movie from beginning to end. It was a wonderful story of growing up and as the memories are long distant everything seems so much more magical and larger than life. As it really does when we are adults looking back at our childhood. I thought the acting was excellent and it was very well cast. Daniel Radcliffe plays a very subdued character far removed from HARRY POTTER and shows that he has the talent to continue in the business as an adult. The other 3 boys are good finds and I am sure we will see more of them in the future. While there is only a small cast, each one has a strong role and Mr & Mrs McAnsh are truly memorable. Kangaroo Island is absolutely stunning and from the dusty outback to the crystal clear coast, the visual splendour is a feast for the eyes. Don't expect a special effects blockbuster, just enjoy the journey of a lovely story!",
         "I believe many of the movie critics out there have been far too harsh in dismissing this film. I found it rather refreshing from the over-hyped, over sensationalized and big budget disappointments in the past few years. Many of the indie/low budget films are far better than what is making the big dollars and getting the heavy promotion these days. December Boys is not a great film but it certainly is good and I found it very enjoyable. I laughed, I cried...and Mr, Radcliffe is definitely on his way to a long and successful career. He isn't the leading character although he is definitely the headlining star that without him this film probably would never have seen the light of day outside Australia. I thought his performance was wonderful. He may not have much dialog, but the sensitivity of his character comes across beautifully. I believe Mr. Radcliffe is underrated as an actor, one desperately trying not to be typecast and stereotyped a \"the boy wizard\". If the media would stop reminding us that he's Harry Potter, and let him be the untapped talent that he obviously is.... Give audiences credit that we can separate an actor from the role he plays. Frankly, not all of us are Potter fans and I don't see HP as this great literary work. It's an okay story that has benefited from brilliant marketing. However, I'm grateful because HP gave us a troupe of new and very talented young actors...and showcased just how many brilliant actors come from the UK. Given many of the horrific child stars and forgettable cookie cutter actors out there in equally forgettable films , here is a young man that shows promise in the years to come. Give him a chance. He is obviously trying very hard to be more than what he's been painted since he was 10. Maps isn't a huge stretch, but a stepping stone from Potter. You can see where Radcliffe was in terms of acting ability right after Potter 4. He is easing his way delicately from his alter ego. Then he demolished his Mickey Mouse Club image with Equus. It's a shame that wasn't made into a film. He was truly brilliant as Alan Strang. Granted this film (like others with A-list stars, mind you) has its trouble spots, but it still doesn't detract that it was beautifully shot and some of the acting was impeccable. Radcliffe has notably excelled further since this film was made over two years ago. Equus showcased that he isn't a one trick pony and that we really do have someone worth looking forward to as a brilliant actor in the future. This film isn't perfect, but I just saw two other films this week that had huge plot holes and continuity errors, etc, so-so acting performances with clichÃ©d plots and so forth but still garnered high praise. Maybe its the high profile stars or those producing/promoting these films. I just don't understand critics sometimes. I don't think anyone expected Oscar-caliber from this film or Radcliffe, but at the same time it is a helluva lot better than other films released this year. To be honest, I would have been disappointed in Radcliffe if he chose some dopey tween flick that seems to be the calling card of American young stars. Herbie Fully Loaded and High School Musical are such great films after all. Radcliffe could cash in on his current fame like the others and make trash, and be the poster boy of the tabloids but he doesn't. That should count for something. I'd rather read more about him than the likes of Lindsay, Paris and Britney any day of the week. . I have seen complete garbage nominated for Oscars in the past and lately I don't put too much stock into many movie critics that give \"A\" ratings to films that I cannot believe someone paid money to even make let alone ones that I would waste my money on. There's nothing wrong with a film that has a simple story line....a feel good movie thats enjoyable to watch. It doesn't have to have grotesque violence, language and explicit sex scenes. Probably one reason I love old Hollywood and independent films. Generally, I find these films wonderful (and many great ones) and ones that are worth the ticket price and buying the DVD. I can't say that about most of the films that are released every year nowadays. It just seems this poor guy (Radcliffe) can't win for losing. If he released a candy/teenybopper flick he would have been crucified...he really takes a risk and goes for it with Equus and people freaked out that he wasn't a good role model for the Potter fans....oh, what a travesty! Yet he was a splash on the London stage and has obviously grown as an actor since this movie was made. Give the guy a break.....I think he will only get better and better with time. I know this was long winded, but I really champion this young actor. Not all Radcliffe fans are squealing 10 year olds. The only thing I found worth to criticise in December Boys was the unclear time period and the time span in the aging of the characters at the end. Hardy unfortunately used music from different periods. The film looks to be set in the 60's but some of the music tells otherwise. And obviously the 'present day' older boys are too old, in my opinion by a couple decades. Some say it was too sugar coated, etc...but there were many films in the golden age of Hollywood (which I loved) that would now be considered too chaste, too sweet, un-realistic...the list goes on and on. I would still take those movies (and this one) any day of the week over 95% of the garbage that is released today. Forget the critics....go see December Boys.",
         "My husband and I loved this movie. Finally a movie where you actually care about the characters. The acting is marvelous, the story is touching and the scenery is magnificent. Not only does every actor in the movie look their part, they are believable for a change. As the movie progresses, it's like you've been invited along on the trip to the cove with these four young orphans to see how they deal with the hand they're dealt. The people they meet during their holiday by sea are exactly what you'd expect. Regular folks with real life emotions, dreams and problems. This was a bold movie by Hollywood's standards. No car chases, explosions, swearing or ego-feeding in this movie. Just great entertainment. For people out there who love good movies; go see this one. It's made the way movies ought to be. Good story, smart dialogue and a believable representation of the subject matter. We loved it! Great Entertainment. Four thumbs up!",
         "The buzz for December Boys surely points to how Daniel Radcliffe will fare sans cloak, glasses and lightning bolt scar on his forehead, to star in a movie that's totally out of the Harry Potter franchise. Gone are the fantastical elements and scores of ready, adoring fans, and in comes a serious dramatic piece about the coming of age, growing up, and raging hormones. Wait, Harry Potter is about that too doesn't it, although it stretches over 7 movies? But Radcliffe comes through unscathed, and it's not before long that you'd forget that here's Harry Potter. While possibly the biggest recognizable name on the cast list, it wasn't a walkover performance as everyone else had raised their act and not allow a young starlet usurp the strength of the movie. Based on a novel by Michael Noonan, December Boys tells the story of 4 orphans, all being born in the month of December, who were sent packing to a seaside village for a vacation, by virtue that it's a reward sent to the orphanage, and what better (lazier?) way to select the lucky few, than the ones celebrating their birthdays the same month. So we have Maps (Radcliffe), Misty (Lee Cormie), Sparks (Christian Byers) and Spit (James Fraser) sent on a journey that will test their close friendship, and as usual, each will come face to face with their individual challenge that will forever change their lives. Gee, I sound like a generic trailer, but trust me, although the premise might sound clichÃ©, December Boys hinges very heavily on the delivery of the child actors for its success. While the spotlight might be on Radcliffe and Cormie, Byers and Fraser each have their own charm, but are restrained by the frequency of their characters' on-screen appearance. The landscape of Kangaroo Island adds vast scale to this relatively small movie, opening our eyes to natural geographical wonders, becoming a character in itself, with its inhabitants mere players on its grounds. While it's not Stand By Me, there's the usual basis that lurks around begging for comparisons. And worse, the story here allows for each of them to try and go one leg up on the other, as they learn that one of the purposes they are there at the village, was to allow for one of them to be selected for adoption. Hence the competition amongst the boys as they vie for attention, putting on their best behaviour, most contrary to what their actual characters are like. Each child however, have an episode directed around him, to similarly allow the audience to pick their preferred sub plots, involving a giant fish, a misunderstood motorcycle stuntman, dealing with mortality issues when their surrogate guardian has to battle disease, and of course, saving the best for last and for Radcliffe, first love, in the form of a young lolita Lucy (Teresa Palmer). Soon, their hot blooded young boy antics and rebellious streaks give way to a tone of seriousness, and there's where the movie adds its poignant gravitas. December Boys might not seem much from the get go, but with each passing minute, it adds layers upon layers to build its repertoire and stand up against the scrutiny of mediocrity. By the time the final scene rolls by, even though it doesn't show much and does so mostly through narration, I thought the ending was perfect, with a tinge of regret, happiness, sorrow, and a show of solidarity all rolled into one.",
         "Set in the late 60s, December Boys is a beautiful, poignant tale of adolescence and abandonment with the vast, awe-inspiring Australian outback as a backdrop, unraveled in the same vein as Stand By Me. \"What's the big deal about having parents anyway?\" Maps (Daniel Radcliffe) retorts to his summer fling Lucy (Teresa Palmer). Maps is the eldest of four orphan boys who get sent for a seaside holiday with an elderly couple. Misty (Lee Cormie) is the youngest and the artistic one of the brood. Sparks (Christian Byers) is good with mechanical things, while Spit (James Fraser) is so named for what he does best. Having been given a glimpse of what the orphans' lives have been like together, you have an idea of where Maps' trend of thought comes from. They've survived so far without parents, and they have had each other to call as family growing up. This just becomes more glaring as they interact with their host family's neighbors, and they get in an emotional competition for possible adoption that tests the limits of their brotherhood. Unfulfilled expectations are shared by all characters regardless of age and situation, and this is the main theme that the audience empathizes with. It is heartbreaking to see their faces light up with hope at the possibility of winning the parent lottery only to be passed on time and time again. Rude awakenings and rejection are themes that most people can relate to after hardened years, but for children to already know it intimately at such an age is what makes December Boys the thoughtful tearjerker it is.",
         "To Jlin from the Emerald Isle .. methinks you had a little too much of the Hard Stuff ;-) Whats it like to be an Orphan in the days of narrow mindedness and strange moral beliefs that were taught then ... this film portrays this well. Excellent Cinema Photography and composition with some excellent stills and excellent script too with some pot shots at the ridiculous order that Nuns were and are today :( with their strange methods at handling Orphans not to mention their narrow minded beliefs. The acting by the 4 orphan boys was very convincing as was the portrayal of how young boys behave like smoking after lights out in bed, or how the awareness of the opposite sex awakened their senses. The orphans were the stars without a doubt the other adults competent enough Jack Thomson was somewhat wooden in his role. To sum up an enjoyable film devoid of any nasties ... not a masterpiece by any means though.",
         "\"December boys\" is a tale of growing up, of brotherhood, of love and most of all about friendship. It's a good movie, I really felt that I cared for what happened to the boys, especially Maps and Misty. Teresa Palmer as Lucy is absolutely beautiful, it's the first time I've laid my eyes on her. You'd think she is a brainless blonde when seeing her, but this one actually can act. At least I felt so. I also liked Fearless, Teresa, Bandy and his wife. They all seemed like so very nice people. After a somewhat slow start, I was entertained 'til the very end. I found myself watching with interest. Still, It's a movie I suspect I wouldn't like as much the next time, or the time after that. I know the story, it doesn't feel like it would be so interesting when it's not the first time. All in all, this December boy gives the December boys a 7/10 stars. Well done.",
         "December Boys is an overly sentimental and clichÃ© ridden tale, but it has a special something that makes it work. That something is the engaging performances of the two major boys - Daniel Radcliffe and Lee Cormie. The action takes place during a Christmas holiday of the late 60's or early 70's in Australia. The December boys are four boys from an outback orphanage whose birthdays fall in December. They are given a treat of a vacation at the shore provided by an older couple. The four are three pre-adolescents - Sparks, Spit, and Misty (Cormie) - and one older boy who acts as the big brother of the younger three. He is Maps, played by Radcliffe. The story is told by Misty as an adult and contains many, probably mis-remembered, events of that eventful vacation. The boys are hosted by an older couple with the man being played by Jack Thompson as Bandy. This is a bare-bones part, and Thompson's considerable talents are wasted. Bandy's wife is ill with cancer, and there are some interesting scenes of interactions with the boys but the couple plays a very small role in the whole thing. The vacation cabin is in a small cove accompanied by several others, and the inhabitants of these neighboring cabins provide a number of interesting characters. The most interesting to the boys is a young, childless couple. They are seen as potential parents by the boys, and the three younger ones compete in a battle for their attention - led by Misty. Maps is far more interested in a local teenage girl with whom he develops an intimate relationship. Because Radcliffe became famous as Harry Potter, Russell Edwards of Variety sarcastically states, \"Destined to be forever known as Harry Potter Gets Laid\u0085,\" but I saw much more in Radcliffe's portrayal of a teenager's first love. His performance is richly affecting. December Boys is an entertaining combination of the vacation adventures and fantasies of four boys coupled with that longing purity of first love. It's not a great movie, but it gives the viewer a good feeling and gives this viewer some memories and emotions of times long passed.",
         "I've seen a lot of movies, from Hollywood to Bollywood, jumping countries and continent, mixing comedies and dramas, actors and amateurs, but I have never seen a movie where I knew that even though it would be sad ending, I would feel happy about it, knowing the characters in the film will always be happy. Where to start...the acting was simple and brilliant. You could not ask more of children this age. Daniel Radcliffe also shone in this role, and I am always delighted to see his movies (he is truly an inspiration for people who want to do good in this world). The scenery is gorgeous. A rocky cove in a corner of Australia, away from civilisation, with power-lines turned on by generators, and sand-dunes and old cars to play on. Simply put, the simple things in life we now take for granted and shun, because we have our iPads and computers, cars and video games. We have forgotten the feeling of brotherhood, of looking out for each other, of enjoying the simple things in life, of fighting but reconciling in the end, of the merit of good deeds that, even when they are hard to make, come back to you in a good way. There is not one criticism I would make of this film. It is a film about growing up and making hard choices, about loneliness and a sense of belonging, about friendship, brotherhood, first love and lost, family, parenting, good life skills. Anything you want, this movie offers. Do not believe a word the critics say. I haven't, and I was absolutely delighted by this movie. If you have a heart and are a human being, you will too. And after you have wept in tears of joy about the beautiful melancholy and serene sense of purpose this movie guides you to, you will then recommend it to your friends, and the words of love and life will spread. 100 out of 10!",
         "A great movie indeed with all that a good movie needs: love, drama, realistic characters, joy, sadness and all the other things that a human being might feel nostalgic about at a certain moment. The orphans change the cove and cove changes them forever and, if you let it, their story might change you as well. The emotional charge simply grows bigger and bigger from the beginning of the movie towards the end thus providing with a finale of biblical proportions (emotionally speaking). Although in the beginning it might not seem like much this is, in my opinion, a movie that will not leave you unchanged and give you a new perspective as to what your dreams are and/or ought to be."
