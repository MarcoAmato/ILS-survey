First of all it was not based on any real, except the gun control theme that rocked the US recently. Nor it was adapted from a book. That's really got me. This was a beautiful screenplay and I could not think how flawlessly someone has written just for a film, not for a book. Secondly, in todays world where the voices were raised for the equal rights/opportunity for women, this film became a great example to head on the right path.\r\n\r\nIt opened with a court scene, then went back to flashback to reveal everything that happened in between period. There's a voting is to take place in the parliament for the introduction of a new bill. The miss Sloane's firm splits over differences and hence two teams fight for one another in the same matter, but to achieve the opposite result. Pursuing the MPs and all other dramatic events takes place, while they are ready to go any length. Then the story comes to an end with a twist with one of them victorious, but a heavy price has to pay it.\r\n\r\nYou might won't like the politics, but this is not one. This is something like the story of an election campaign team. How they work to achieve their goal, particularly keep checking their rivalry. So it was more or less a cat-mouse game kind, but the perspective was not shared equally. The majority of the film was from miss Sloane's angle. Just like from 'Zero Dark Thirty', Chastain has been simply awesome. One of her career best performance for sure. I don't get it how this film had missed the Oscars race. She should have won the best actress award. I might a little late to watch, but I did not miss it. So I hope you too as well not to miss it.\r\n\r\n_8/10_",

      "synopsis": "The opening shot of this film shows Elizabeth Sloane (Jessica Chastain) delivering a monologue directly to camera, telling us Lobbying is about foresight and anticipating your opponents moves and devising countermeasures. The winner plots one step ahead of the opposition, and plays her trump card just after they play theirs. It is revealed she is reciting a mantra to her lawyer. He advises her to answer as instructed. She responds with what he has told her to memorize \"Upon the advice of counsel, I must respectfully decline to answer your question, based on my rights under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution\". He continues asking questions to prompt her; she repeats the same thing over and over. She jokes about trying variations and he tells her its serious and they want her behind bars. The media is covering the hearing, saying that Elizabeth is a lobbyist being charged with bribery and corruption. In court, she states her name and then pleads the fifth to every question asked. We flashback to SEVEN MONTHS EARLIER. Elizabeth is chatting with her friend Jane (Alison Pill) who is ready to quit her job at the law firm they are lobbyists for so she can enroll in post-grad. They walk to the bathroom and Elizabeth talks about the palm oil tax that is being taxed by the Federal Government, depleting the funds for Kenyans. She suggests the senator proposing the bill goes on an all-expenses-paid field trip to one of the plantations in Kenya and then showered with gifts; when he returns, his bill will die. In the strategy room, Elizabeth holds a meeting with other lobbyists. She asks a young junior lobbyist if sales tax applies to chocolate-covered cakes or chocolate-covered biscuits and he says he doesn't know. We get a taste of Elizabeth in action as she schemes to build support for their cause. She is called upstairs to have a meeting with some older men including George Dupont (Sam Waterson), who works at the firm, as well as the president of the Gun Lobby. They are concerned about the Heaton-Harris Amendment which would require background checks for those trying to purchase firearms. The Gun Lobby president wants Elizabeth to be the face on a bill against background checks since she is a great lobbyist and also a woman so she will appeal to the masses. She laughs hysterically at this and then tells him she believes in the other side of the bill that background checks keep guns from going into the wrong hands and the Gun Lobby should support them because it would help distinguish responsible gun owners. Later, George and another lobbyist argue about Elizabeth in his office while she waits outside. She enters and tells them she has overheard their conversation as she can read lips and they have glass walls. She points out that when she was hired, she said she would only fight for causes she believed in. George accuses her of being biased because she was a victim of gun violence but she says she simply formed an opinion on the issue. He points out she reps Kenyans and Elizabeth says she does so to stop the government from looting one of their sources of incomes. She adds that her reputation is the reason the Gun Lobby even came to the firm for support because she has a reputation for winning. Elizabeth talks to her doctor about pills she takes to help her sleep. Simultaneously, we see her pop a pill at a fundraiser event in D.C. When she leaves, a man follows behind and asks to talk to her. Guessing hes from the Post, she agrees they can chat while she walks to her car. He asks if its true that she refused to work with the Gun Lobby. He tells her hes impressed that she only works for clients whom she believes in. He points out that dildos are illegal In Texas but you can get a shotgun within five minutes and asks if she knows anything about the Gun Lobby's opponents, Peterson Wyatt. She says they're a small law firm and the president is probably a wuss. He then reveals that hes Rodolfo Schmidt (Mark Strong), the president of Peterson Wyatt. He wants her to lead a fight to pass a bill. He writes down a quote A conviction-lobbyist never cheats. She exposes cheaters. On the other side, he writes down the amount that Peterson Wyatt would be able to pay her. She takes the piece of paper and he asks where her car is. She admits that she doesn't actually have a car and just wanted to see what he wanted. Back at the office, Elizabeth teases one of her colleagues about eating chocolate cake for breakfast. He tells her its a muffin. She tells him both muffins and cakes have eggs, flour, sugar, cocoa powder, milk, chocolate. That by rebranding cake as muffins, they can claim they're not cake and that answers the questions about taxing chocolate biscuits that she proposed of her young colleague. He asks why he proposed the question of her if she already knew the answer; She tells him she is educating him in case he isn't coming with her and then announces that shes decided to leave the firm and will start up as a consultant for Peterson Wyatt. As part of her deal, she negotiated for all of them to come with her with no change to their compensation. One colleague, Pat Connors (Michael Stuhlbarg), says the Gun Lobby just recently agreed to hire them to fight against the bill and he refuses to join her. But one by one, everyone does except her best friend, Jane, who now says she is thankful to be at one of the best firms in the city and she is staying. She adds that she wont miss all the late night calls Elizabeth requires of her hinting at her insomnia. In present day, Elizabeth is in court, being questioned about the Kenyans bribing a senator but she continues to invoke her fifth amendment. But when the congressman (John Lithgow) asks her about the medication she takes to treat her insomnia, Elizabeth gets flustered. Finally she blurts out that shes not a drug addict and that her medication is no different than a double espresso and corrects him that Kenya is a republic on the continent of Africa and not an African republic. He has tricked her into breaking so she can no longer invoke the fifth amendment. Outside, Elizabeth's lawyer is livid and says she could get five years minimum. Now if she stays quiet, shell be sent to jail for contempt of Congress. We go back to six months earlier. Elizabeth goes into a hotel room where a man (Jake Lacy) is sprawled on the bed. She asks where Mark is. He says Marks moved on and he's Forde. It becomes clear he is an escort that Elizabeth has hired. They size each other up and then she begins to undress. At Peterson Wyatt, all the new lobbyists settle in with the old ones, right after learning that the palm oil tax Elizabeth fought against was dropped. Elizabeth meets Esme (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) who is the firms authority on gun control. They realize that they need exactly 60 senators to vote for the bill and not a single less 59 wont do. While they have some senators locked in, the other side only needs seven and there are 22 senators in play. They need to appeal to the voters because the Gun Lobby has much more money than them. The group gets a man who lost his daughter in a mass shooting to go on TV and discuss his push for background checks. This irritates the lobbyists fighting for the Gun Lobby. Jane is now working with the men, giving them her thoughts on the situation. Elizabeth makes a phone call, asking someone in the media to make sure they capture an event. She is sending one of her colleagues, Clara, to a fundraiser and she will ask a question about where a congressman stands on the amendment. Arbitrarily, Elizabeth reveals shes reading a book on pulmonary pathophysiology and asks a junior about a doctor he was told to research. A colleague tells Elizabeth the opposite side is going opt take the angle that their bill is the first step towards a national register of firearms. She counters that the bill will simply delay acquiring a gun by two weeks but Americans will wait six months for an MRI. She tells them to use sound bites and points out that anyone desperate to get a gun immediately shouldn't be allowed anywhere near one. At the fundraiser, the congressman takes questions from the audience. Clara was planted to be called on but he skips her. From outside the ballroom, Elizabeth talks to Clara through a cell phone and points out that Jane and others from the rival firm are there and when they vetted Clara, they would have found out she worked with Peterson Wyatt, using her as a decoy. The last question is asked by a doctor claiming to work for the Pulmonary Associates of America. He asks how the congressman plans to vote on the Heaton-Harris Amendment. Elizabeth admits that hes actually an actor they hired and when they vetted him, it linked to a doctor with that name and they assumed the actor is him. Because they thought Clara was their representative, they didn't research him too thoroughly. On stage, the congressman feels pressured to say he will support the amendment and its all caught on camera so that he cant change his mind later. Elizabeth goes to the hotel room again and Forde and her chat with each other. He is curious why she uses escorts. Elizabeth says she never has time to date and if she wasn't able to squeeze it in her 20s, shes not going to do so now. Back at the office, Clara is upset that she was used as a decoy. She checked with Finance and found that the actor hired as the doctor was paid out of Elizabeth's pocket to keep them from detecting him. Clara suggests Elizabeth is afraid to trust her because someone on their staff might be a rat. The group contests its anti-gun campaign. Elizabeth is seen traveling around the country, meeting with many women on the issue. The group knows one senator will bring seven people with him if they can get his vote. They ask at a rally if senator supports the Heaton-Harris Amendment at a rally and he says they've got his vote. We then see that senator playing billiards with George Dupont, who tells him they're going to back a powerful man to run for office. The man thinks they're threatening his political career and is not worried because he knows he can beat the man. He is then told that man will be running against his son, who is just beginning his political career unless he votes against the Heaton-Harris Amendment. Back in D.C., Elizabeth and her group now have a lot of supporters and only a handful left to go before they get enough to pass the amendment. Elizabeth suggests they will focus on swinging Florida but the others protest its very gun-friendly and will never change. They also learn of the senator who has done a 180 (after the Gun Lobby threatened to put a strong candidate against his son) which loses them eight senators, all transferring to the other side. Elizabeth suggests making him feel the weight of his policy change. Elizabeth goes to a television network and watches as Connors, the lobbyist who refused to join her company move, preps for a debate on the amendment. He asks why she isn't participating and suggests the two of them debate in the future. She agrees. Back in the strategy room, everyone discusses going to Florida. Elizabeth points out they're not really going to Florida and tells them to turn to tab 12 in their notebooks. One of the women, Cynthia, doesn't have anything there but everyone else has a picture of Cynthia meeting with Connors in the park, giving him info on what their strategy is. Elizabeth explains that Florida was false information to see who would spill it. Security is called and Cynthia is escorted out of the building while her files and hard drives secured. Cynthia protests she was offered a partnership track. Elizabeth admits Florida was a ruse; they are going to focus on Colorado while the Gun Lobby is focused on Florida, which was never in danger of changing sides. The lobbyists go to the bar and Clara asks how she did it. When the others explain Cynthia wanted to further her career, she pointed out that she was asking about Elizabeth. Simultaneously, Elizabeth chats with Esme when she runs into her hailing a cab. Elizabeth suggests they share one and explains that she doesnt drive because she never got her drivers license. Elizabeth takes her to her favorite Korean BBQ spot, a sort of hole in the wall but with great food. The two chat about why the amendment. Elizabeth mentions she looked at Esmes résumé and noticed a huge gap of time unaccounted for. She asks if she would talk about her background if it helped the issue. Esme says, yes. The next day, Clara asks Elizabeth how she knew the woman was involved in leaking information. It becomes clear that Elizabeth didn't know; she simply had every single one of them followed and watched to make sure no one was a mole. Elizabeth meets some men in a mobile surveillance unit. They can do 24-hour surveillance using a cockroach which has been retro-fitted with electrodes to record things, to use against the senator who flip-flopped. Rodolfo, the president of Peterson Wyatt, has followed Elizabeth and he convinces her not to go through with what would be blackmailing of a member of Congress. She agrees. At a fundraiser, Elizabeth runs into Forde but she pretends she doesn't know him. One of the lobbyists at Elizabeth's old firm witnesses the exchange. An inflatable rat is driven around town, attacking the senator who turned on the amendment, until he buckles and returns his support to the amendment. The country gets behind the movement and the rat gets its own Twitter feed. The congressman is advised to change his position on Heaton-Harris before it ruins his career. The group now has 18 votes locked with 16 to go. Elizabeth is getting her makeup on, preparing for a televised debate with Connors. She asks that Esme get touched up, too, since its a small studio and the camera might pick her up. The debate begins and its intense with Elizabeth using sound bites that were prepared in advance (we know because the other lobbyists are watching, throwing out talking points before she repeats them). She points that Americans require drivers licenses for drivers and its illegal to operate a care without going through rigorous tests and those tests dont infringe on the freedom for people to drive cars. In Japan, chefs train for seven years before they can serve poisonous blowfish to customers. Connors talks about the Second Amendment and Elizabeth counters that it was signed at a time when life expectancy was 38 and very few people lived in America its not representative of the country as it exists today. She adds nothing is unimpeachable, not even the Constitution and people hide behind it like people do with the Bible and gay rights. She adds, \"It shouldn't matter what it says in the Bible, Constitution, or your horoscope\", which wasn't rehearsed and it throws her team aback. Elizabeth adds there are many people affected by violence and background checks will be done for them. She personally knows someone who had to hide in a locker room while a shooter shot up her school in 1998 her name is Esme Manucharian and shes there with her today. The camera films Esme who runs away, frightened. Back at the office, Rodolfo asks Elizabeth if she ever sleeps since shes always out, working. He is astonished that she set Esme up. Elizabeth has known about her story all along since she researched the staff before she met them. She tells Rodolfo that shes been traveling around the country targeting women they make up more than half the population, are typically for background checks for gun users, and the white men of the Gun Lobby ignore them. She has raised about 15 million in a PAC set up for their cause. Now they can combat the Gun Lobby. Esme becomes the face of their movement and gets a lot of media coverage. This helps shift Americas support for background checks. She doesn't hold it against Elizabeth though because she knew, from when she first met her, that Elizabeth was going to use her experience as a high school student for the cause. Meanwhile, Connors and his team begin to worry and know they have to make a big move to get momentum to swing back to their side. In the usual hotel room, Elizabeth meets with Forde. He has looked her up and knows shes a lobbyist. He asks why she pretended not to know him at the gala. She says, in public, they are strangers. Forde compliments her ability to change into another person like she did when he approached her. They talk about his background and why he works as an escort. Elizabeth suggests spending the night ordering room service and talking. They bond, as friends. She tells him its the closest shes ever been to being on a date because she was too busy with business and her professional life. He refuses to take the money because he says it was just dinner with a friend but she demands he takes it anyway. Esme calls Elizabeth while she dines at the Korean BBQ place they first went to dinner at. Distracted, she bumps into a man and walks away without a pencil. When Esme goes outside, a man follows her. He is a gun owner upset that she is the face of the amendment which would require background checks for gun owners and points a gun at her, preparing to shoot her. But he is stopped by the man who has followed Esme to return her pencil. The man who saved Esme now becomes the face for the Gun Lobby because he had a registered gun that he carried for protection. All the attention Esme had gotten now goes to him. When asked about the Heaton-Harris Amendment, he says he opposes it. Connors and his team paint D.C. with posters of his face; hes also given awards and declared a hero. Elizabeth tries to spin this in that hes someone who is a responsible gun owner and background checks would actually be in their best interest to disassociate them from those who are dangerous. But it doesnt work. They start losing support, even from senators who had promised to vote for the amendment. The group is defeated and suggests regrouping in the morning. Alone, Elizabeth calls her old friend, Jane, but Jane replies by telling her she has the wrong number, not wanting to talk to Elizabeth while she works for the other side. Jane points out to her team that the public is still in favor of gun control and voter pressure is strong. Without Elizabeth, their campaign has nothing so they have to remove her somehow. They want a congressional hearing to look into Elizabeth's unorthodox lobbying practices because George knows a Congressman he can persuade. Everyone on the firm is asked to dig up some dirt on Elizabeth that they can use to launch the hearing. After many false leads, Jane finds out that Elizabeth violated the gift ban with the Kenyans and the palm oil tax. George meets with Congressman Sperling in his car. George convinces him to lead an inquiry into Elizabeth's affairs. Congressman knows that people will suspect hes been strong-armed into doing this but George tells him they're arranging an article on Elizabeth's misdeeds which would justify the launch of the investigation. Congressman Sperling complains that it will costs millions of public money but George says the Gun Lobby will blitz him with negative finance and they'll reduce him to nothing if he doesn't cooperate. At the office, Elizabeth's secretary tells her beyond the hate mail and death threats, she found a letter from the a newspaper doing a feature on her, asking for an interview. Elizabeth realizes they didn't reach out via phone because they don't want Elizabeth to respond so they can claim she had no comment but instead, she wants to grant an interview, defending herself. During the interview, Elizabeth tells the reporter that the media is part of the problem because it generates hatred for individuals and chooses scandal over insight. She wants to know why the reporter is asking abstract questions which have nothing to do with the basis of the article. She finally leaves, pointing out the reporter doesn't even care what she has to say she hasn't even turned the Dictaphone on. The article comes out and everyone at the office is upset at how it has attacked Elizabeth. She shrugs it off and says they can recycle the papers and turn them into pencils which will go to a reporter with some integrity. But a week later, more and more articles against Elizabeth turn up from past acquaintances. They're 29 days until the vote and they've lost all ground and are afraid the bad press will lead to an indictment. Were back to present day while the indictment is going on. In the hearing room, Congressman Sperling asks about the Nutella Tax law (nickname for the palm oil tax). She insists it was paid for by the Kenyan government and but the congressman says it was paid for by a pooled account. He points out that others contributed to the account before the Kenyan government had it so it violates the gift ban. She accuses him of holding some special interest in dragging the process out as long as possible (hinting that hes trying to slander her name so it keeps their amendment from getting passed). He then tells the court that he has one more witness Robert Forde (the escort). Elizabeth's lawyer tries to fight this but Elizabeth tells him to let it play. Forde admits he is an escort. But when they ask if hes ever met Elizabeth before, he responds that he did once, at a fundraising event and never as a client. In the lawyers office, Rodolfo and Elizabeth discuss how Heaton-Harris is dead and the issues gone cold. Elizabeth wonders what it would take to revive it. She is told it will take an earthquake. Elizabeth says they should hope for one. Back at the Congressional Hearing Room, Congressman Sperling asks if there's anything Elizabeth wants to say. She says that she received an offer to take up a position advocating for gun control and gives a speech about how important it was for her to refuse the Gun Lobby and work on the Heaton-Harris campaign. She brings up a recent mass shooting and how shes sacrificed her career and personal life for an issue she believed in. She then says there are dishonest politicians who stoop lower than the rest to get further than the rest. In the public gallery, Jane leans over to George Dupont and says she's like to discuss her future. He tells her its not the time. Elizabeth continues, reciting the quote we heard at the beginning of the film. Lobbying is about foresight. About anticipating your opponents moves and devising countermeasures. The winner plots one step ahead of the opposition, and plays her trump card just after they play theirs. \"It's about making sure you surprise them, and they don't surprise you\". She says she anticipated what would happen if they had some momentum with Heaton-Harris. Jane approaches George again and tells him shes resigning and doing post-grad work (as she always planned). Elizabeth tells her before she left the firm working with the Gun Lobby, she retained an operative of hers in their ranks. We flashback to see Jane was working in tandem with Elizabeth all along, which is why Jane gave them the info of Elizabeth signing the paperwork that led to her indictment. It is revealed that the surveillance team that Elizabeth met with had used the cybernetic cockroach to film George blackmailing Congressman Sperling we see the bug videotaping their meeting. In the present, Elizabeth tells everyone to type a DNS address into a browser and download the file named Earthquake. Everyone does and watches the video of Congressman Sperling being blackmailed by George We flashback to Elizabeth looking through things in her home including the offer that was made to her one side of the note reads A conviction-lobbyist never cheats. She exposes cheaters. On the other side is the offer Peterson Wyatt offers $0 for your services. She had agreed to switch sides because she believed in the cause, even though she went from a salary to going unpaid. The hearing is adjourned. Nonetheless, Elizabeth is sent to prison for the breach she committed by signing the contract. She is granted five years minimum, although suspected to be free in less than a year on parole. Six months into her sentence, her lawyer visits the prison and tells her the Gun Lobby is the most hated lobby group now and the amendment passed. But he points out that now guns are sold on the black market and it resulted in career suicide for her. Elizabeth says this was her last hurrah. The credits roll and then we see Elizabeth leaving the prison. George Dupont and Congressman Sperling are facing charges of conspiracy, corruption, and abuse of powers. The public now knows Elizabeth was the victim of a smear campaign and the amendment is passed into law.",

         "This is a powerful female driven film about the title character and politics. It's one of Jessica's best performances if not the best. This character allows her to show so many things of her skill set. She's so believable, every nuance, every line she delivers is just so perfect. She should have been nominated for this role for every award show... Miss Sloane is a great movie which has a very fast pace. You can't predict what's coming next, great performances by everyone on the cast. Forget about the bad reviews, even if you don't like politics this movie will keep you interested. It's upsetting that It bombed at the box office. I think It's because of the subject matter and people might had enough of the political climate in real life. But It really deserves to be seen. I highly recommend this awesome, very underrated movie.",
         "From the standpoint of a dispassionate observer separate from the tangled mess that is US politics. One of the best movies I have ever seen. The intensity of the movie is unrivaled. The genius who designed the plot of this movie deserves a whole host of accolades for them personally. Twists and turns around every corner making it engaging on a level similar to that experienced when deconstructing a Shakespeare play. This movie is for anyone who desires not only a piece of quality entertainment but also something that stretches their intellect. Aside perhaps from the role of Tony Stark I have never encountered a more badass main character.",
         "Loved it. Jessica is very believable as uptight and smart, her lines are delivered with sharp intensity and she is just darn right sexy. Beautiful sets and cinematography. Cool wardrobes. Excellent whistle blowing. Any film that exposes truths about how massive greed and corruption are is a needed film to see. The hidden message is NOT about gun control, it's about corruption and how deep it goes. Seeing an educated, powerful women with needs also shows realism. The score is also nice. This is a great film and is very underrated!",
         "So many users are getting their knickers in a twist. They are giving this excellent movie with great twists a low rating because the story is about gun law, and sides with, yes you guessed it, anti gun lobbyists. All the 1/10s own a gun lol. It's actually not about gun law at all. Gun law has only been used as the subject of the day, to put the point across about dirty politicians and lobbyists. This movie is terrific. It's complicated at the start, but soon starts to make sense. The main character is terrific. Cold, hard and calculating. Great job! I can't say anymore because I never include spoilers. Just trust me. Whether you're for or against guns, that's not the point. This is a political thriller folks. Sit back, relax and enjoy it! BTW....it's not a true story. Don't take it so seriously. 8/10",
         "It makes absolutely no sense that this film is bombing at the box office, this is a great film! Maybe it's because it's fresh off the heels of an exhausting election, or maybe it's because of the other big time films out right like Star Wars. I sincerely hope that it's not because of the NRA, I hope that people won't avoid this wonderful movie just because of the gun lobby. Jessica chastain gives a real powerhouse performance as Elizabeth Sloane, a tough as nails lobbyist for the Brady campaign. Also here is Sam Waterson, who works for the gun lobby, and I really liked him in this role, he fit in it well and gives a good performance. I loved the great writing in the movie and the clever moves that are made. This political drama is so interesting and well constructed. Mark Strong is so good here too, chastain and him have a great on screen chemistry/presence too. The film will keep your attention the entire way through, it has too because there is just so much happening. Now I know that plenty of conservatives and big time Pro-NRA people will want you to avoid it and maybe even write a bunch of scathing articles slamming it, but don't listen, oh what a great movie this is! 10/10!",
         "Just watched the movie and I have to say I'm shocked that it's rated so low on IMDb, as I have watched much, MUCH worse movies with better ratings. Scrolling to evidentially biased ratings and reviews I'm giving it a 10, just hoping it will balance out the harm done. Jessica Chastain delivered great performance, but she wasn't the only one, whole crew was really good, but she really did earn that globe nomination. Furthermore, movie is beautifully captured, cinematography is great and whole atmosphere is really nice. The last but not the least, it's a great thriller, with an unpredictable twist and not boring for a moment. I do understand it's might be different experience watching it for an European audience, as from the start second amendment and gun legislative is for most of us here absurd, however, although I can understand that for some Americans it might seem one sided story, my question is aren't many of story lines one sided, to be honest it's not advertised as documentary, so why should you even expect other side to be equally represented? Strongly recommend to give this movie attention it deserves.",
         "Fantastic movie - exceptional acting, intricate plot, suspenseful scenes throughout and an unbelievable twist at the end, which was impossible to predict. Whilst some gun-tooting viewers may not appreciate the biased view towards the need for greater gun control measures (a point so intelligently made by drawing an analogy with car ownership), there can be no doubting the quality of this piece of work from a cinematographic perspective. The recurrent theme not of gun ownership issues but rather of aberrant behaviour by self-serving politicians, if indeed not evident corruption and nepotism, is a theme that will strike a strong cord in many Western countries today, and lead us to question what democracy actually means in a world where money plays the role of god.",
         "i can tell that the gun lobby is also active on IMDb. this movie is straight told with unexpected moves. it is realistic as well as true. but in a world of alternative facts difficult to accept. it goes on too long far too long.. it has to stop here and today. the connection with the gun lobby and the senate is authentic. the characters are real. what i liked most of all was the fact that everyone is selling out anyone except the call-boy. in this world of business and in the world of politics , the decent one is the one who sells his body. while everybody would kill for their ego or for wealth.. he remains sincere and surreal . the whore is the only person with ethics and value is messed up world is quite a message, although it had little to do with the main story... again i feel disgusted by the reviews who have nothing to do with the movie but a lot with their political views... the reviews prove this movie is true!",
         "I picked this movie without prejudice, as I hadn't heard a word about it. And I loved it!!! The tempo is sustained, the performances outstanding. An interesting story with a twist, well written, and the perfect cast. One element that also enhances the movie: its diversity. Multi-faceted characters which gives spice to the story's meat. The only downside: the way love is given a bad name. How do you want the youth to connect if you keep telling them that love ain't the sh*t?? It is a recurrent theme in 21st century cinema that i condemn, because it perpetuates mechanic sex--humans deprived from feelings. I am for a little more optimism in that domain and the human species. My 2cents; LM ARNAL",
         "This movie is awesome. One of the best pictures I've ever seen. Very strong emotionally. The performances are top notch; all of them. But In my opinion, this is Jessica Chastain's all time best role. She deserved at least an \"actress in a leading role\" nomination. She achieves a better performance level than Natalie Portman - \"jackie\", Isabelle Huppert - Elle\" or even the winner - Emma Stone in \"La La Land\". Again, my opinion, of course. The interest prediction on this movie describes an ideal curve, growing strongly from the start till the end. And at the end it explodes in a rainbow of emotions you could never predict. It's absolutely astonishing. Loved it.",
         "Surprise! Hoplophobic non-sense (*whispers* but we already knew that). An interesting observation is that Hollywood loves to glorify law- breaking gun violence in order to sell movies while simultaneously vowing to disarm law abiding citizens through propaganda pieces precisely like \"Miss Sloane\". Strange times we live in but I digress. Since Bloomberg and his minions can't buy politicians into office to push his agenda, he pays for a movie: Miss Sloane. Using movies to push a political agenda certainly isn't an unwise move on part of anti- gun elites (that are protected by armed guards) as it worked well for Goebbels, ironically, for similar reasons.",
         "In a roller-coaster year for political intrigue on both sides of the Atlantic, and with all hell breaking loose again between Trump and 'The Hill', here comes \"Miss Sloane\". Jessica Chastain ( \"The Martian\", \"Interstellar\") plays the titular heroine (I use the term loosely): a pill-popping insomniac who is working herself into an early grave as a top-Washington lobbyist. The game of lobbying is, as she describes, staying one step of the competition and \"playing your trump card just after your opponent has played theirs\". But all is not going well for Elizabeth Sloane. For the film opens with her being on trial for corruption in front of a congressional hearing, chaired by Senator Sperling (John Lithgow, \"The Accountant\"). Through flashback we see how she got to that point, moving from one firm headed by George Dupont (Sam Waterston, \"The Killing Fields\") to another headed by Rodolfo Schmidt (Mark Strong, \"Kick Ass\", \"Kingsman: The Secret Service\") against the backdrop of the high-stakes lobbying around a new gun-control bill. Her fanatical drive to 'win at all costs', and the trail of destruction, through her cutthroat work ethic, that she leaves behind her, digs her an ever-deeper hole as the political and legal net closes in around her. Jessica Chastain has played strong and decisive women before, most notably in \"Zero Dark Thirty\", but probably never to this extreme degree. Here she is like Miranda Priestly from \"The Devil Wears Prada\", but not played for laughs. Miss Sloane is an emotionally and physically damaged woman, but a formidable one who takes charge both in the boardroom and in the bedroom, through the unashamed use of male escorts (in the well-muscled form of Jake Lacy, \"Their Finest\"). As such her character is not remotely likable, but one the I could certainly relate to from past business dealings I've had. (And no, I don't mean as a male prostitute!) I found Sloane to be one of the more fascinating characters in this year's releases: I was never being sure whether her actions are being powered from a background of strong moral conviction (fuelled by a devastating childhood incident perhaps?) or through pure greed and lust for power. I thought Chastain excelled in the role, but for balance the illustrious Mrs Mann thought she rather overplayed her hand at times. Outside of Chastain's central performance though, this is a very strong ensemble cast. Mark Strong \u2013 not with an English accent for once and not playing a heavy \u2013 is great as the frustrated boss, as is the seldom-seen Sam Waterston (who, by the way, is the father of Katherine Waterston of current \"Alien: Covenant\" fame). Christine Baranski (so good in \"The Good Wife\" and now \"The Good Fight\") pops up in a cameo as a flinty Senator. But the outstanding turn for me was Oxford-born Gugu Mbatha-Raw (\"Belle\", \"Beauty and the Beast\" \u2013 and yes, I'm aware of the irony in this pairing!). Playing Sloane's colleague Esme Manucharian \u2013 both a lady with a secret in her past as well as possessing a great name \u2013 Mbatha-Raw is just riveting and deserving of a Supporting Actress nomination in my book. What binds the whole two hours together is an extraordinarily skillful script by debut writer Jonathan Perera, which has both a gripping and ever-twisting story as well as a host of quotable lines. Ladies and gentlemen, we may have a new Aaron Sorkin on the block! It's a brave script, dealing as it does with 2nd amendment issues, since there seems to be nothing that stirs up American comment like gun-control. For those living in the UK (where gun deaths are over 50 times less per capita than in the US) the whole topic is both fascinating and perplexing. The marvelous Cinematography is by Sebastian Blenkov \u2013 the second time this gentleman has come to my attention within a month (the first time being \"Their Finest\"). The director is Portsmouth-born Brit John Madden (\"Shakespeare in Love\", \"The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel\") and he does a great job in sustaining the tension and energy throughout the running time. This all makes it a great shame that the film has not done well at the US box office, perhaps because ( the film was released in December 2016) the public had more than their fill of politics after a bruising and divisive election. (I'm not sure the UK release date now \u2013 just before our own General Election \u2013 is wise either). But for me, this was a memorable film, and come the end of the year it might well be up there in my top 10 for the year. I'm a sucker for a good political thriller with \"All the President's Men\" and \"Primary Colors\" in my personal list as some of my favourite ever films. If you like those films, \"House of Cards\" or remember fondly TV series like \"The West Wing\" or (for those with even longer memories) \"Washington Behind Closed Doors\" then I would strongly recommend you get out and watch this. (For the graphical version of this review, please visit bob-the-movie- man.com. Thanks.)",
         "I live in Norway, we have one of the strictest gun control-laws in the world, I am anti-gun and even I got some heavy propaganda-vibes from this movie. The movie picks ups hot topic but does not invite to debate, you get force-fed a certain viewpoint and it just falls flat. I had hoped for something much better but i was sorely disappointed, this could have been really good but you are forced to think the same way as the main character and that does not make the viewing pleasant. I would much more recommend that you watch a real debate on the topic where both views are presented by both sides, movies like this one will only get this ongoing debate stuck and we will never hear the end of it.",
         "This is the first big movie about lobbiests I've come across. Jessica Chastain plays a tough part but unfortunately her personality isn't examined in depth during the 2 hours. The film explores the ways men are treated differently from women. For example she hires a male escort and while men would overlook this in a male lobbyist ('cos it would be far from the worst thing they do), for a woman it would end her socially. The escort is the perfect combination of sleazy and possibly entertaining. I don't imagine the notion that background checks before the purchase of a firearm is a seriously debatable point and so the film doesn't get into some pointless debate. Perhaps the proposed 'Registry of Muslims' is to allow crazy WASP's buy a surface to air missile but prevent sane Muslims from buying a 22. This movie was under promoted, like most films staring women. If you look at the posters for 'Arrival' you'll see that the female star got the same billing as her male co-stars who have a fraction of the lines. This was a movie about a strong woman, not unwilling to be disliked by men. Its funny at the start when the NRA man who thinks women are best spending time in the kitchen, is nervous about meeting her. He doesn't know if he should shake hands with a woman in the business world. Political movies where good triumphs (such as 'The Ides of March') didn't don't get much support despite the great cast and script. Instead tragic films like the new 'King Kong' or the recently lame 'Jurassic Park'offering are the only things in the cinema. My totally biased opinion is that some stupid men (like the committee Ms Chastain refers to) make choices about movies. They make testosterone fueled choices and go for expensive pointless non- scripts like 'Gods of Egypt' instead of low budget films that have a genuine script. Obviously - I'm with Her!",
         "One of the best movies I have ever seen. The intensity of the movie is unrivaled, twists and turns around every corner. You can't predict what's coming next. The hidden message is NOT about gun control, it's about corruption nepotism even greed and how deep it goes in the system. This will strike a cord in many countries today. It's about a cat and mouse game to see who can pull more tricks. Sloane is one badass character. Jessica Chastain delivers a phenomenal performance! I'm definitely going to see more of her films now. Besides the amazing plot and acting, another thing that stood out to me was that the only person not selling her was the call-boy. Talk about irony. One considered working a \"filthy\" job is the only one with ethics and moral. Probably some of you won't agree given the low ratings the movie has here but we're all entitled to have our opinions. A thrill ride of a movie that will leave you awed by the time it's finished. JUST SEE IT!",
         "Before we go any further, I am a veteran, a gun owner, with a minor in film and a theater background, and I keep an open mind when I watch movies. I actually saw the movie and I will keep politics aside but as you can tell from other reviews a lot of people are just down voting or up voting this movie based on politics. My score and critique are primarily focused on the screenwriter and director. These two factors I feel sunk the movie. This is the Jonathan Perera's first screenplay and while a valiant attempt he wrote something in one of the hardest genres, about a culture that isn't his, dealing with an issue he doesn't understand. And the director who I loved in The Best Marigold Hotel has many of the same issues, not understanding the American landscape. It is like Mel Gibson doing Braveheart, it isn't accurate at all however the difference is that Braveheart wasn't being shown to William Wallace. What made me want to see this movie is that it is a French company (EuropaCorp) with a British director and Screenwriter (John Madden and Jonathan Perera), a Dutch Cinematographer (Sebastion Blankov), about a controversial American industry (American Lobbying) that deals almost exclusively with a controversial American topic (gun control). It is almost a perfect storm of bad ideas and misconceptions, and it kind of is that. The one saving grace is that Jessica Chastain, who plays the lead, gives a great performance but it can't save this movie. The movie is meant to be an American Political Thriller that examines the corrupt world of Washington politics with a meaning message, but everyone involved is such an outsider to that world that it is greatly flawed, in both its depiction of D.C., lobbying, and American gun culture. The movie starts with Ms. Sloane being a powerful lobbyist in D.C. working for a right wing lobbying group. However for \"reasons\" when her boss asks her to start lobbying for a gun's rights, one of the most well-funded American Lobbying groups, she says no and immediately jumps ship and takes her entire team minus one member to a \"rag tag\" group. This is in the beginning of the film, and here is the fundamental issue. It comically misunderstands the issues and motivations of lobbyists in D.C, American Conservatives, and even American law. Besides the many non-competition clauses you sign when join a powerful D.C. lobby group, besides the gun lobby being portrayed in a comical fashion, what really hampers the movie is motivations of the characters especially the lead Ms. Sloan. She isn't an idealist or an activist. She isn't in it solely for the money. She just wants to win, but if that is the case you still question most of her decisions. But the moment you start getting into the movie, another terrible side character ruins it, or a terrible understanding of American politics ruins it, or a shoehorned in message about guns (really this is a very minor part of the movie seeing the ads and reviews you would think it was just about that). The movie does have a few tropes, such as the \"Court Room Moment\" that plays like the 15th season of law order as opposed to \"A few good men\". The movie is just lacking. The movie has a few good scenes but it is destroyed by inaccuracies and a lack of character depth. This movie has so much potential with this lead, but she can't save the sinking ship, and the marketing for it was just a huge risk that upset a lot of people, but that is what happens when a large team of outsiders only know America from online and media portrayals of us. See it only if you are a fan of Jessica Chastain. Otherwise go see Moana, or Rouge One, yeah they are Disney, but at least the motivations of the characters has more depth.",
         "This is overall good work, a talky but fierce and intelligent script, featuring one of those performances that people hopefully will continue to go back to from Jessica Chastain that makes it clearer why she shows so much depth and dimension for a character that could, in other hands or on the page by itself, not seem to be as... human (the very opening, which you've seen in the trailer, shows her as so cold it may be, uh, \"scary\" to those men uncomfortable with women simply being strong *people*, regardless of gender, or, maybe, because of it too). It's a very good movie, the kind that Hollywood used to make more of (or just saw a wider release than 1,600 screens at a s***y time of release at the end of an Election year), though just shy of greatness. If it had had a Fincher or an Alan J Pakula behind it or something with a little stronger of a vision - Madden is good, but standard, a hired gun who executes it as well as he knows how, and casts it impeccably, but shoots it like it's (often, not always) a TV show, and I thought less of House of Cards and more of Scandal, albeit this is much smarter than Scandal gets - then it might be unstoppable. The only part of the ending I found unrealistic really is that a gun bill for universal background checks and stricter regulations could pass in this country, regardless of what comes out about the sneaky meetings between lobbyists and politicians - for practically ANY reason. It's a nice ending, but a little but of a fantasy in the world we're living in, where race and culture and so many other factors make gun control such a burnt hot potato, if that makes sense. But considering that's 5% of this movie, it's great to see the other 95% showing the political world as cutthroat as it is, which is how it f****g is. Or as Sloane puts it, and I'm paraphrasing here, being cynical is something Polyannish people say when they don't want to sound naive. I'd add what George Carlin says about them: the real cynics think that everything is going to be alright.",
         "The main reason I'm posting a review is to counter all the 1-star reviews left by pro-gun advocates who obviously have not seen the movie. I saw it last night and it is *not* about the gun lobby, although that's part of the story. In fact, the movie does a good job portraying both sides of the argument. About the movie. I liked it and thought it had depth and raised a lot of questions about power, greed, corruption, the weakness of some of our laws, means vs. ends, and the motivations of some of the country's movers and shakers and elected representatives. I plan to see it again. It also brings up the question about males vs. females in high power jobs. Men who act one way are called leaders, women who act that same way are called ice queens or something like that. For example, I'm sure there has been a lot of discomfort over her, er, sex life when I don't think audiences would have had the same discomfort if it had been a male lead. On the downside, I thought it was a bit \"over the top\" at times and I just didn't buy into some of the motivations or plotting, but what do I know about power politics in Washington?",
         "Not that impressive, and too long. I found this movie interesting but unimpressive - typical hollywood movie where a super man or woman leads the story with invincible power to offer some lessons, whether it is right, biased, or prejudiced. Nontheless, I like this movie's lesson about how pathetic america's gun situation has been. My favorite part of this movie is last scene when she got out of the prison - the music, color and atmosphere outside the prison, and the feeling of expectation she might meet somebody( maybe her escort?) when she was staring at",
         "This movie is nothing more than horrible anti constitutional rights propaganda. Hollywood is working with the anti American gun control groups. People wonder why the establishment is working against them. This movie tries to dupe you into surrendering your constitutional rights as an American citizens. This movies was made by two non- Americans who hate American values. Foreigners telling Americans what to do is unacceptable. Horrible performance by actors and actresses involved in this movie as well. Were the hosts/anchors of the The Young Turks, Michael Bloomberg, George Soros, and B. Hussien Obama among the writers and producers? Most pathetic movie I've ever seen. Roger Ebert would roll in his grave if he saw Miss Sloane. Miss Sloane should be nominated for Worst Picture at the Razzies. I'd give zero out of ten if I could.",
         "It's almost like there are two separate movies within one. The first part is a tedious almost a hour and a half political and legal jargon filled introduction to Miss Sloane and her pompous must-win attitude. She is lobbyist living in D.C. working for a large firm but has a unfriendly fallout and joins another firm to lobby against the 2nd amendment. She gathers some team members from her earlier firm and in Esme she finds someone who would come to play a crucial role later. We also get a look into Miss Sloane's personal life and what's the reason behind Miss Sloane's 18 hour workdays and insomnia. Once we gets over the initial slump, there's a turning point after which the film really picks up the pace for a thrilling finish although it comes a tad too late to save the movie. Jessica Chastain is a strong actress and the later half really drives home the point but the first half doesn't highlight it. If you're patient enough, it still works but I wouldn't be surprised if people are turned away by the tedious first 90 minutes and walk out the theater.",
         "This was not a movie about left vs right or agendas. The advocates for gun reform and background checks vs the gun lobbyists were merely the format for showing what a rigorous process it is to get bills passed in Congress, the price you have to pay for it and how broken our entire system is ... that most people are unaware of. It even left out the most important fact that 70% of Americans want stronger background checks to purchase a gun, so it really wasn't a pro or con movie. It's obvious that those one star reviewers, who only talked about the movie in terms of liberal and Republican or the left and the right, never saw the movie and only wanted to discourage people from seeing it. I've seen literature from the right that tells people to go to movie and book review sites and down vote any of them that appear to have a liberal bias. They're told that they don't even have to watch the movies or read the books. Just bash them if they sound liberal. I'm not taking sides here, just showing how one side works. After looking at the one star rating reviews, I gave the movie an extra star to offset their obvious political agenda driven star ratings. They had nothing to say about the actual movie. There isn't any way, after watching the movie, that you'd think one star is all it deserves. There wasn't one second when the movie drags or that you would want to miss...unless you have no interest in politics at all (a serious problem in American culture) but in that case, you probably wouldn't go see it anyway. This was one of the few much better movies I've seen this year after being lured into so many that have nothing to say, are all computer flash and bang and are forgotten the next day. The acting was great all around but especially from Elizabeth Sloane (Jessica Chastain) who was incredible, and the ending was a total surprise., We need more people to see movies like this and IMDb should be wary of this problem with the ratings. I've seen it before (there's tons of them about this movie) and it destroys the credibility of the whole rating system.",
         "Anti-gun propaganda film masquerading as a \"strong woman\" drama. God this woman is obnoxious. I couldn't stand being in the same room with her for more than 10 minutes. Chastain as the lead character was unappealing and unsympathetic so consequently I wasn't rooting for her. Quite the opposite. I was kind of hoping she would be taken out by opposition. To those who say the subject matter of gun control was just the background for the drama of the lead character, I say uh uh. Not balanced. No, this was the typical Hollywood \"guns are bad & people who strive to take them away from everybody are good\" drivel. Boring and predictable. Don't waste your time like I did.",
         "Seriously terrible, formulaic, self-righteous political commentary. Smart-ass, social misfit lobbyist with high standards (do you already see a problem?) takes on the gun lobby and Washington's old white men... bla, bla, bla. Save your time. This movie was created bottom-up by young, inexperienced, idealistic and vitriolic minions reaching for a spark of light within widely held misconception.",
         "The story is fine when you watch it, but after the films \"twist ending\" nothing about the story makes sense in retrospect. Chastain is good, though she's very monotonous and that tires quickly. Mark Strong is always good (he seriously deserves more recognition) the rest of the cast are frankly, irrelevant. Jon Lithgow deserves a mention for his portrayal of a bumbling senator falling just short of a full Dick Solomon. In short, the film thinks it's more clever than it is, it fails to surprise and is very predictable. It's an adequate movie if you just want to chill out of an evening, but if you're after something more meaningful, or a political thriller with more guts, look elsewhere."
