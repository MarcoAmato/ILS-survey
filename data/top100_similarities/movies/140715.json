As a film, it was awesome and as a biographical film, even more awesome, but not an inspiring film that I was expecting. There were many bad things in it, like the language and character portrayals. Though hats off to the filmmakers for rendering the it with the bold contents. I don't know if it being true to the actual events, but anybody can feel how those circumstances would have been for those involved in the real.\r\n\r\nOne thing is for sure, the film is not for the families. The first half was the reason which was very negatively appealed, particularly the racism and police abuse preoccupied rather than telling the actual story. But the next half was much better. I liked it because of that part which crafted so brilliantly. That's where the real journey begins. Well played characters, everybody who repressed those real ones were done incredible job.\r\n\r\nThis film revealed something I did know. Like how the Rap music got so popular. I quite belong to the same generation where this thing got its revolution. It was like another 'Lords of Dogtown' where the young guys made skateboards popular, but here it was the Rap songs. It was a two and half hour long film, longer than an average film length, but the pace was good. Except the strong contents, the narration never looked dull. I totally enjoyed watching it, a good film for adults, particularly those who love Rap music must not think of missing it.\r\n\r\n_7/10_",

      "synopsis": "Compton, South-Central Los Angeles, California. 1986 Easy-E (Jason Mitchell) is in the middle of a drug deal that's breaking bad. Guns are pulled. Threats are made. The police appears and raids the block and E barely makes it out of the house and escapes to freedom across the rooftops. Meanwhile, Dr. Dre (Corey Hawkins) is listening to records in his room. His mom (Lisa Renee Pitts) is mad that he missed a job interview. He says he has a job working as a D.J. at a local club. She points out that making $50 a night isn't a real job. She wants the best for him. He says he does too. He moves out. His little brother T (Keith Powers) is sad to see him go. Elsewhere, Ice Cube (O'Shea Jackson Jr.) is writing rhymes on the school bus. Other kids on the bus horse around by flashing gang signs at a car driving next to the bus. The car cuts them off and the guys inside board the bus and pull guns. They tell the kids they better start \"gang banging their books\" or the Crenshaw Mafia might just get them. Cube goes to the house where Dre is staying. He and Jinx (Cleavon McClendon) are making beats. Cube tells them what happened on the bus and lets them know that he wrote some new rhymes. As Cube goes to head back home, the LAPD stops him and violently searches him. Later at Doo-Tos Club, Dre and DJ Yella (Neil Brown Jr.) are spinning. The club owners Lonzo (Corey Reynolds) tells them he doesn't want any \"rap shit\" on stage, but as soon as he steps out, Cube takes the mic and raps about his day. Lonzo hates it. But MC Ren (Aldis Hodge) and E are at the club and they like what they hear. Dre asks E to think about putting his money into the music. There's a fight in the parking lot after and the LAPD locks up Dre. E bails him out. Outside the police station, Dre tells E that if he can sling dope, he can sling records. Together, they form Ruthless Records. They invited a group from New York called HBO to record \"Boyz in the Hood\", one of the raps Cube wrote, but they hate it. Its suggested that Cube just record it, but he cant because hes already in a group with Jinx. So E does it. After much coaching from Dre, hes able to hit the beat. The rap song, 'Boyz n the Hood' by Eazy-E and NWA becomes the #1 song for six weeks. Music manager Jerry Heller (Paul Giamati) meets with E and tells him that he wants to make him legit and together they can build something big with their talent. Skateland, 1988 E tells the group he wants them all wearing black clothing because it's professional. Jerry has invited other record executives to the show to check it out. They all pass with the exception of Bryan Turner (Tate Ellington) from Priority Records. Priority currently has the California Raisins on their roster. NWA thinks that's a joke until Turner points out that the Raisins went gold. Bobby Brown bodyguard Suge Knight (R. Marcos Taylor) is also at the show. He gives them props. The band records 'Straight Outta Compton' at a recording studio in Torrance, California. During a break in the recording, the guys go outside and are harassed by the racist LAPD. Jerry witnesses police brutality first hand. After the event, Cube writes \"Fuck tha Police\". Jerry has given E his contract, but no one else has gotten theirs. Jerry says that's normal. The lawyers take forever. Meanwhile, Dre and his lady are sleeping with a baby at his aunt's house. NWA Tour, 1989; The Summit in Houston The band plays inside the packed arena. Afterwards, Dre tells his brother over the phone that he can come out and meet up with them in Florida. Two guys show up with guns to find their girl at a hotel party. NWA chase them out with guns of their own. Riverfront Colosseum in Ohio The FBI issues a warning about playing 'Fuck tha Police'. Jerry recommends putting the song on hold for a little while. E sees this as free publicity. Spectrum in Pennsylvania The rest of NWA still doesn't have contracts. Cube mentions that to Dre, but Dre says he doesn't want Cube jumping to any conclusions that anything shady is going on. Dre gets a 911 page. His mom tells him that T was killed in a fight. Dre breaks down crying, and the rest of the group consoles him. E tells him that they will always stay brothers. They go back home to California so Dre can go to the funeral. He tells his mom this would have never happened if he had just let his brother come on the road like he wanted. His mom says that isn't true and that she's proud of Dre. Joe Louis Arena Detroit, Michigan The Detroit Police show up and tell them they can't play 'Fuck tha Police' due to the vulgar language of the song. Cube tells the crowd what's going on and they play it anyway. The crowd goes crazy. The police make their way to the stage. Gun shots are fired and everyone flees. In the ensuing riot, NWA is arrested. NWA holds a press conference. Cube says that their art reflects their reality. A reporter asks the band what a guy from Compton does when he starts making money like that. Everyone looks to E for an awkward moment. He answers, \"Buy Raider gear!\" Jerry finally gives Cube a contract to sign and offers him a check for $75,000 once he signs it. Cube wants to get a lawyer to look it over because he knows something is wrong. Jerry doesn't want him to do that, so Cube walks away. He says he'd \"rather be broke than be fucked\". Dre doesn't leave because \"we gotta do what we gotta do.\" He has his mom, a girl and a child to think about. Suge is there when the tour ends and announces that hes decided to get into managing talent. Priority Records 1990 Ice Cube is now with his wife Kim (Alexandra Shipp). They meet with Turner who tells Cube that there isn't a lot of money in going solo, but if his first record is a hit, they'll make it up to him on the second. His first album is also a hit. Eazy-E Wet & Wild Party Six months later, 1991. Jerry has E signing contracts. There's a whole Ruthless roster now. Jerry advises E that it's important to keep Dre happy. Suge tries to recruit Dre. Cube wants an advance for his second album, but Bryan says its complicated, so Cube smashes up his office. E is jealous of Cube's success. The DOC (Marlon Yates Jr) is in an accident and his throat is crushed. Dre visits him at the hospital. Suge is there and points out that E and Jerry aren't. He makes another attempts at recruiting Dre and offers to have his people look at Dre's contract. Bryan plays the newest NWA record, \"Real Niggaz\", for Cube where they call him a Benedict Arnold. Cube answers it by dissing NWA and Jerry on his next album. He calls Jerry a Jew. Out of everyone, Jerry is most upset and wants to sue Cube for defamation of character and for being anti-Semitic. He tells E to take care of it. At a New Music Expo, people from Ruthless Records get into a fight with Cube's people (Lench Mob). Meanwhile, the Rodney King beating is televised. A mysterious man shows up at Jerry's house one night and freaks him out. Dre tells E to get rid of Jerry, but E is loyal. Dre points out that they didn't make it because of Jerry but because their shit is dope. Dre reminds E that when T died, E promised him that they'd all stay brothers, and replies sadly, \"I guess you forgot about that.\" Dre leaves to form his own company (Death Row) with Suge, who in a later scene, beats the shit out of E to get him to release Dre and DOC from their Ruthless contracts. Death Row starts signing new up-and-coming artists like Snoop Dogg. E tells Jerry that they have to kill Suge. Jerry says they fight with lawyers. Dre and Snoop collaborate, but all is not well. Dre is put off by Suges over the top violent nature. On April 29, 1992, the verdict in the Rodney King case comes down. The LAPD is found not guilty and the LA Riots begin. One year later, 1993. E begins having money problems; Cube is reading the script for his role in the feature film 'Friday'; Dr. Dre's album, \"The Chronic\", has sold five million copies. But despite the success of Dre's album, he finally decides to leave Suge. E sees Cube at a club and they patch things up and show respect to each other's careers. Cube agrees to do an NWA reunion as long as there's no Jerry. E is starting to cough. E's girl Tomica (Carra Patterson) looks over the contracts and tells him that Jerry took advantage of him and now he's broke. E meets with Jerry, who points out that he isn't looking too good. But eventually E fires him. Then he calls Dre and they patch things up as well too. They talk about collaborating again. Ren and Yella are ready to start recording a new NWA album. They're just waiting for Cube and Dre to show when E faints and is sent to the hospital. The doctor tells him that he's HIV-positive and all they can do is try to keep him comfortable for up to six months. In late 1994, E goes public with the announcement that he's dying of AIDS. Another few months later, Dre visits him in the hospital when he's in a coma. Cube shows up, but doesn't go in the room because he doesn't want to see E like that. A few days later, on March 26, 1995, Eazy-E dies from AIDS at 31-years-old. The film closes on a montage of the real life surviving members of NWA and their careers up to the present. Ice Cube continues to make music and is a big-name movie star. Dre has become a hugely successful business man. He makes Eminem a star and sells his Beats by Dre brand to Apple for $3 billion.",

         "I've been writing reviews for IMDb for ten years, and I think something fishy is going on here. STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON is getting very, very high reviews from the vast majority of IMDb reviewers -- but the nine and ten- star reviews are all getting pelted with \"negative\" marks, earning scores of \"1 out of 15\" likes. So what's the problem? The problem is that this movie wasn't supposed to be a hit. The mass audience wasn't supposed to respond to the story of young black men facing oppression and coming out on top. The American people were not supposed to see the real truth about how their police treat minorities every day. Quick, let's bury the good reviews! Let's spawn a phony backlash! Let's discredit Dr. Dre and Ice Cube on the basis of things they did twenty years ago. Oh, and let's all get sentimental about Eazy E because he's dead, and young black men are okay once they're dead. The dead ones are no longer scary and threatening. The problem with this movie is that the people who made it actually dared to portray young, angry black men as heroic, not as criminals or predators. It's okay to glamorize white criminals, because Hollywood was built on that. From PUBLIC ENEMY to THE GODFATHER, white audiences have always loved to sentimentalize their own criminals. But you can't do that with black men who rap about crime, even when they aren't actually criminals themselves. When Cagney postures like a thug in some ancient piece of crap that's cool. But when black men do it today that's dangerous and irresponsible! There are very powerful elements in this country that are terribly frightened by this movie. They're frightened because this movie gets white audiences to see young black men as something other than dangerous criminals. The scenes of NWA being roughed up by police are a terrible threat to the powerful elements in our society, who stay in power only by keeping white people scared of black men. They can't tolerate the idea of black male victims, so they instantly start a media backlash portraying the victims as criminals. I say this is a good movie, a powerful, exciting film that presents a side of American life that is almost never seen on the screen. I know I'm not going to get many likes for this review, but what the hell. I've got enough already.",
         "I am not a big fan of N.W.A and their music does not interest me. I have to admit that after seeing this movie I was overwhelmed with dismay. It is true that the media and the movie critics have been slanting the news to trap us into seeing this film. Alas what a boring film!. From the beginning to end,this documentary movie about five black rappers failed to impress me. Off course this movie deserves a fair NC17 rating,but the explicit sex and the bad language did not offend me since I am an adult. What I strongly hated about this movie is that it indirectly promotes racism and hatred against black people for in this movie are represented as ruthless and immoral rebels . Sorry to tell you that (Straight Outta Compton) is a movie you should avoid if you do not want to waste your time and lose your money.",
         "This movie tells the story of 5 corrupt musicians who live a depraved life and are happy about it!. This bad biography film is about the life of the Rap group NWA. The story basically follows the life of Eazy-E, Dr Dre, and Ice Cube. The film is so boring and have a slow pace . The women nudity and the hardcore could please horny men for a temporary period of time. After seeing the movie I was really disappointed because I did not see any drama in it and the boredom in it really kills and sucks so bad. Sadly this is a bad adult movie with corrupt men that I advise you to avoid.",
         "Ask five narcissistic, self centered, selfish, juvenile, thugs to create a movie about themselves and this is just the garbage that will come out. Most is obviously not accurate but embellished by the creators to make themselves look like heroes. And they are far from heroes. Sure, they were angry, but now that they all are millionaires, the whole thing seems very self-serving. It makes me wonder what kind of person would be proud of such a dismal portrayal of their life. I think NWA now stands for Not Worth Attending. Graphic nudity, sex, drugs, violence...what great role models these gentlemen are for the new generation. And the fact that extra security has to be assigned to the theaters showing this garbage speaks volumes for the type of people this crap attracts.",
         "Gosh what the hell is going on with this movie?. It ain't worth watching!. \"Straight Outta Compton\" portrays the life of ruthless beggars who abruptly rose to fame as a result of their infamous vulgarity. Everything is boring and disgusting about this bad and violent movie. The music really sucked and the acting was artificial. The few enjoyable things that lustful adults could temporarily enjoy are the naked prostitutes and the blow job scene. I think this ain't a musical biography but rather a story of evil men who enjoy pornography and who fantasize about committing every kind of sin. REALLY IT IS A GREAT SHAME!.",
         "Straight Outta Compton tells the bad way of life about NWA corrupt artists who seem so happy to be bad,aggressive,violent and depraved. They enjoy their perversion and rejoice in being angry and ruthless thugs. What A Great Shame!. The music in Straight Outta Compton Is Completely Disgusting Just Like This Nonsense Movie. I know that rebels should not resort to any violence if they want to get their rights. Those dirty rascals always swear and enjoy being evil and corrupt and they suck so bad indeed. Straight Outta Compton Is Completely Boring From The Start Till The End. Do Not Believe The Fake High Votes!. Do Not Believe The Hype!. Honestly this is The Worst Movie Ever Seen.",
         "...I had to watch the movie since I actually liked at the time some of the music of NWA, especially the title track of the movie. Yet what happened after-wards, after their success, is just a sell out to make a bunch of money with no more attitude than all the others. And now the movie and it would deserve just one star, yet the music brings back some memories when things could have been changed in a different way than they wanted to. Look at them now, nowadays...thats all that there is to say about the characters of the movie. The acting is typical for the gang banging crowds nowadays and so it can be seen on every street-corner in major cities and is nothing special and that I mean not in a good way. If that was meant to change things, well Sirs, screw you! The story itself, well I do not know what is true and what is not, but like stated above, in the end it came to make more money than others. What they have changed is just that violence and negativity can bring success, that youths of today look up to them what they could do and want to do as well...THAT is what they have changed and just because Compton is nowadays almost everywhere, does not make this a success in changes, but a success in stupidity. And so it does not matter to me if you become legit than after-wards and make movies about your awful youth and how you can succeed and then make funny movies, like Ice Cube.... So what remains is the music...there was once a dream of a few guys who wanted to change something, what they have changed is to have today an attitude, which became wide spread, for the big buck. Nothing wrong with it, yet don't be surprised when you get now the attitude that you spread and so...please straight BACK to Compton and please try again! For former NWA fans a must, for people who love the attitude nowadays a must, for normalos who aren't impressed but rather appalled by the success of a negative attitude and the real change they created, a no show!",
         "If by voting this a 3 or lower I could send the real life versions of these losers along with their shameless \"gimme ma money dawg\" sellout \"actors\" to jail, I'd still vote a 1, and so only because I cannot cast a lower vote. What's there to say? If the reviewers who gave this a 10 are paid to raise the rating (and this is most certainly the overwhelming case) then please do not have children! You are moral sellouts. If on the other hand you actually enjoyed this movie, sorry, but you're an idiot. A story--er nightmare, about scumbag filth who prostituted their way through the 80's and 90's as the moral fabric of society was being systematically destroyed by a new brand of media and television, and used this gap in evolution, as these types always use any possible opportunity to capitalize where the least amount of intellect or work is necessary, to make themselves downright rich so they can then spend the rest of their useless, oxygen-thieving carbon waste lives to further deconstruct decency by telling their tale of filth to the world with actors who don't have the skills necessary to clean a truck stop restroom. The lower your IQ the higher your rating will be. For those who have not seen it and wish to retain some sense of dignity, don't even watch this on pirated sites. You'll lose over an hour of your life for nothing. Read a book instead - even a comic book! Your time will be better spent. This movie is testament to the fact that this generation is lost and worthless. Anything good to come out of the last 2 decades seems so rare that it deserves a statue. One can only hope that this trend ends and soon, so the world can start rebuilding a sense of pride and decency again. Yuck! Ugh! Blah! No amount of Listerine rinses will help you get the taste of this movie out of your mouth.",
         "I am totally disenchanted that I wasted my time and money in seeing one of the most awful movie ever. Mean rappers who violate every law and live a meaningless life where every kind of sin is allowed . These gangsters are not peaceful rebels at all,but evil and aggressive rappers who respect no one and whose atrociousness and uncontrollable instincts made them more like beasts rather than human beings. The story of five horny sex slaves who seek pleasure in pornography and explicit sex. The music is absolutely lousy and noisy. Believe it or not :This is a disgusting movie. See this movie on your own responsibility.",
         "I really tried to look at this movie with an open mind although this type of movie isn't really my cup of tea anyway so to speak. It was awful to say the least with no cohesive plot whatsoever! It glorified the worst aspects in our society and portrayed the \"thug\" lifestyle as somehow glamorous? It was directed with an obvious bias to regurgitate the same old stereotypes everyone already has but in a way that attempts, but fails, to put a positive spin on \"Hip Hop\" culture. Just not a good movie in any way, shape, or form. Do not go see! If you want to see a great movie with an African American cast that is uplifting and shows what is admirable about our great society then go see \"War Room\"!!",
         "{Straight Outta Compton }is a movie everyone must avoid.It has a lot of offensive words ( Profaning Jesus As mother fuc.er) by a blasphemous white man who often shouts in the face of his own dad and describes his own dad as a (mother fuc.er)!!!!. This film instead of teaching people how to respect others ,it has a destructive theme of corrupting the youth and speaks in favor of using random drugs . Parents Beware!. It has unnecessary violence especially against women. Feminists must beware of this movie. Furthermore,there is no single didactic theme in this movie except corrupting teens and instigating boys to rebel and torture their own beloved fathers. All I know is that peaceful rebels who want to get their rights should never ever resort to violence. Concerning the music,it is not my type.This movie's plot is weak. I could not find any suspense in this movie at all except boredom.",
         "This was appalling to watch real hip hop and rap was people like Kool Moe Dee or the young Busy Bee movie's like this make our world a harder place It felt like this was sent out out to all the teens and children it's wrong appalling. This isn't how music should be this genre is so poisoned and tainted it shouldn't of been funded it was unbearable. Would it of been so hard to have some positive people in it positive lyrics. Not that their life stories aren't bad or respected it's just the movie was all about rewarding ignorance I feel like anyone that watched this has been tainted it's not the cast, I respect some of the cast it just put the wrong message out to people especially the ones underage that will watch this. The swearing, drugs and violence were a huge impact on this and now more teens will do it monkey see monkey do. If it was old school if it was like respected hip hop artist in the 80's it would of been way better and I would of loved it.",
         "I'll come clean and say that I generally liked this film because I love hip hop; particularly from the late 80's through to the late 90's. I was interested in the character portrayal, the music was great and as a hip hop fan it was interesting. However ... Honestly, as a film it was pretty bad really. The acting is terrible, it's an hour too long and I find it a bit weird that Cube and Dre are bigging themselves up massively and they are the producers. I can't imagine that anyone that does not like hip hop would even begin to like this film in the slightest. It's very boring towards the end and it's just a series of really weird scenes all cut together. I'm not sure why it's doing so well with the critics, but I expect that the timing is great with Dre's new album and the Apple Music stuff. Either way, if you like hip hop you'll like this for a lot of reasons. If you don't, this is likely to be the worse film you'll ever see!",
         "I should first clarify that while I'm no fan of rap music, I can appreciate any solid movie about a musical group. That all said, the movie was horribly flawed. Movies in which the antiheros can be liked are indicators that a movie may be quality. This was no such film. The main characters were simply not likable, yet we're supposed to sympathize with their supposed \"peril and hardship.\" Once they achieve the fame they were oh so desperate for, they become aggressive and egotistical. However, I can excuse that, since there are far worse problems with the film. The plot has no direction whatsoever. It's a series of mild hardships, followed by some success, followed by an \"authority figure out to get them.\" Then you just rinse and repeat. An hour into the movie, I was wondering if my hair was graying. This was my largest problem with the movie, along with a distinct lack of chemistry between any of the main leads. The movie had a weak plot, weak characters, among much else. Granted, I laughed a few times in the film, and found Easy-E tolerable. For those few good things in the movie, I'll give it a 2 out of 10. It's overrated, don't bother.",
         "I cannot stress how disappointed I was with this movie. I expected a powerful, raw and real view into the true story of the revolution of hip hop/rap. I was quite young when all of this actually occurred but (growing up in the 90's) music was evolving in new and significant ways that was truly exciting. As far as the stories behind the music we were left with what little we heard on MTV news, read in the few gossip columns of magazines and word of mouth. That's why I was eager to see this movie. With social media now we know every step everyone takes-and they are aware of that-so I was looking forward to seeing a depiction of a time before that. A behind the scenes look at what really went on when nobody was looking-because then compared to now-nobody was. ...Instead what I got was 2 1/2 hours of horrible acting! I've seen more character in infomercials than in this movie. Seriously I'm more emotionally invested in if Bob can get that burnt cheese off his non-stick pan than I was of the deaths in this movie. The actors seemed as if every single blink was scripted, nothing seemed natural or real at all-which to me is important when you're portraying something that actually happened! If the intentions of this movie were to take a real life, hard, emotional yet exciting revolutionary story and make it seem fake and drab it gets 10 stars. But it wasn't, therefore I give it 1. It could've and should've been something great.",
         "This is a typical movie that glorifies one party and demonizes another. There are three sides of the story: party A, party B, and the truth. Cops had just as much reason to target young black men as young black men had reason to target innocent people in the streets. The thing that should not be glorified encouraged in young people who are inspired by this film is the terrible attitudes and general lack of respect for anyone. Aside from the dominating racial theme of this movie, the truth of the events that took place is stretched to put it lightly. Fact checking any number of the scenes that were portrayed will lead you to see that the facts were warped in order to convey the story that they wanted rather than the truth. Along with the fictitious plot-line, the acting is cheesy and not believable. There is no stand out performance and one can expect that, as this is many of these young actors' first big time film. This movie is a renter at best; the only saving grace is the music.",
         "I'm no fan of the police, and I know first hand that police officers can be nasty and abuse their power, but the way \"Straight Outta Compton\" portrays the LAPD is about as realistic as an X-Men villain. Oh the big bad police keep picking on these low-lifes who make money off exploiting their own people and promoting the spread of violence within black communities... I like NWA, and I liked them all as solo artists, so believe me when I say that this isn't an indictment on their musical talent, but still this movie really annoyed me less than halfway into it. As I've gotten older, I've learned how to think a little more critically. NWA should not be glorified, those who control our society want you to put these idiots on a pedestal, but don't do it! NWA was not some rebellious voice that black people could rally around in an effort to improve their lives... No, it was the opposite of that... NWA and gangster rap in general is there to KEEP YOU ON THE PLANTATION! To fill your head with criminal and immoral nonsense in an effort to keep you stupid, keep you physically incarcerated, and keep you mentally enslaved... That way nothing will ever change, and you will continue to destroy yourself and your community. And that's the real........",
         "The movie was poor, I was expecting a real rag to riches story and the films to portray the troubles of easy e, as he made nma.Instead it hown him to be a money grabber, when in fact that was dr dre and ice cube. The movie is a typical \" lets make black people cool\" movie, gloryfying mindless violence, over the top swearing, and thuggery, its not cool, its not big and its not clever. It really is a poor portrayal of what could have been a half decent movie, It if would have employed decent actors, stuck to a real life story and made the characters more likable then it might have made it but it was just another \" lets glorify black men as being cool thugs\" movie. Boring, over rated, tedious, and had every stereotype under the sun to go with it. who ever rates this movie above a 1 is either a mindless teenager or someone who knows absolutely nothing about movies.",
         "I didn't believe that was Eazy - e. That was no where near the real Eazy e. They made him look soft but he was the hardest in the crew. I think there was too much Cube influence and the sad thing is that Cubes son played the part exceptionally well and was the most believable performance. I think N.W.A and Eazy's story differ perhaps from the perspective of cube and Dre. There wasn't much about MC Ren in the movie and being a fan of M C Ren and Eazy, I found hat disappointing. Dre's role was played well and Dre was the realest in contributing towards the truth in the writing of the story. All in all we want Eazy-e movie on it's own and this time man the f**k up and let em know he gave you your success. They made him look younger than the rest in the movie and he was the eldest. It was totally believable but worth the watch for a small insight into the perspective of this amazing rap group.",
         "Ghurghgh. I loved N.W.A. for their gall, anger and methods, but hated their misogyny. Still, this film focuses on that, disses MC Ren's abilities to lift the group after Dre left, and yeah, there's more misogyny here, still. Drab. Sad. The best bits are of the band shaping their first album. The rest should be read in books and preferably forgotten. It's not hard to see why Ice Cube went on to surpass what Dre did later, even on his first solo album. I wish one would hear more dissing of Dre courtesy of Eazy-E, buuut--Eazy's dead, so Dre's words take precedence, I guess. And there's even a whole buckload of distasteful ad for beats headphones at the end of the film. Truly bad.",
         "I think that if you're going to make a movie like this then you need to show all sides, the good and the bad. -Like Eazy and Dre's disrespectful, repugnant \"black b*tches\" comments (No wonder Dre seemingly never had a problem with Eminem's infamous \"black b*tch\" lyrics). -Like Dre's refusal to have anything to do with his black kids. You put your white kids into private school while the black ones are stuck in the ghetto. Doesn't the fakery just gnaw at you, Dre? As a black woman, I have zero respect for you. -Like the abuses that women faced at the hands of Dre, that he only apologized for when this hokey movie was about to come out. Aside from Ice Cube, a family man who doesn't deny his kids or disrespect black women (at least not anymore), these are not the people you want your kids to emulate. Watching this movie was painful because even though I grew up to this music and used to have at least a modicum of appreciation for it all, as an adult I see the damage that it's done to an entire generation, and to watch these men painted as martyrs and heroes and such literally turned my stomach. It's SO FAKE. You can see through it even if you don't know anything about the real rappers. I'd advise you all to do your research on these people. Dre especially does not deserve respect or even a portion of your paycheck. So glad I waited until it played on HBO. I would never buy this junk.",
         "So I know people within the music industry that have been in it for over 20 years. I usually have access to V.I.P./backstage.... So that being said, when this came out quite a few of my musician buddies mentioned they had been around N.W.A. in those days or knew people close to them. Their responses though were not so kind. They mentioned quite a bit of this movie is made up/Hollywood fluff just to sell it. So don't take this as an actually history piece, because it is NOT. Pretty much all of them were disgusted by it. Think the real story will ever happen? Most likely not. Sure, I grew up to their music, but I just couldn't bring myself to finish watching this.",
         "First i have to confess that before watching this i didn't have a clue who NWA was. The Hip Hip / Rap scene passed me by or more accurately i avoided it because i really can't stand rap. F. Gary Gray lazily presumes the audience is already familiar with these people and that annoyed me. I did not have a clue who the members of NWA were and i think that put me at a massive disadvantage when watching this film. The characters aren't the most likable of people. They seemed to spend the majority of the film scowling and arguing about money rather than making music and it this grated on me ( but not as much as the music) . Only in the last half an hour of the film do we actually see any form of compassion or humanity from the band members . It wasn't until the film showed a few real film footage clips near the end did i realise how well they did with the casting as the actors as they really do look like the real artists. Sadly that wasn't enough for me to like this film but i'm sure fans of NWA would totally disagree.",
         "\"Straight Outta Compton\" is one of the most talked-about films from this year and it gives us an insight into the rise and fall of the successful hip-hop posse \"NWA\". And even if I am not too interested in rap music, I cannot deny having heard of some of the main characters such as Suge Knight and Dr. Dre of course. Maybe my lack of interest in this film is because I have not lived back then yet or wasn't old enough to follow these significant years in hip hop history. The director is F. Gary Gray and you may have seen his work \"Law Abiding Citizen\". Another problem I had with Compton is that it just felt too long for its own good. There was nothing really refreshing in here, pretty much everything expected, such as the guys' struggles with (predominantly white) policemen, authority arguments with other black people living in the hood etc. Oscar nominee Paul Giamatti may be the most known name in the cast here playing a prominent record company boss and even if he is good as usual, he cannot make this film a memorable watch either. This movie runs for almost 2.5 hours, which is definitely way too long. They just did not have the material to make this an exciting watch for such a long time. 100 minutes would have been more than enough. There are occasionally interesting references about the 1980s such as near the end people thinking the HIV virus would only be transmitted through gay sex, but also this area is not enough and could have been much more than it actually turned out to be. I think this film is only a good watch for people who are already hugely interested in rap music before watching. This is no film that will spark an interest for anybody who doesn't really care about hip hop. Surprised this one has received such favorable critical reception. Not recommended.",
         "I didn't have high expectations for this but I knew the characters portrayed and was interested in their history. Unfortunately, the acting is poor and the direction appears to have no purpose. The music has not stood the test of time and is now dull, repetitious and tries far too hard. It is amazing to look back and believe that these people and their \"music\" became popular at all. Rap lacks any real innovation and doesn't seem to have progressed very far since the 1980s. It needs to steer away from the violence and misogyny that it popularizes and I wonder why women don't complain out loudly about this. The actual story is so stereotypical and formulaic that it became tedious to watch very early on and made it difficult to stay interested. After watching I cannot believe the high rating the film has here and I can only put it down to some earnest fans and their friends voting for the music rather than the story."
