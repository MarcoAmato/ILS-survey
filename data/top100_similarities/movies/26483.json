      "synopsis": "In the distant future, humans have died out, and animals have mutated into creatures with human characteristics. In this future world, an aging rock star named Mok has been toying with dark powers, and has found a possible way to unlock a doorway to Hell. To do so, he has to find a special voice. In Ohm-Town, Mok finds that voice in a girl named Angel. Mok requests that she meet him at his palatial estate, though Angel brings along her bandmates, included her hot-headed boyfriend Omar, and their bandmates Dizzy and Stretch. Omar has his assistants 'The Schlepper Brothers' (Toad, Sleazy and Zip) occupy the Angel's bandmates while he attempts to get her to assist him. Angel refuses to leave her bandmates, and Mok ends up drugging her, before placing her, himself, and the Schlepper Brothers in his personal dirigible, that takes off for Nuke York. Omar assumes that Angel has abandoned the band, but the others convince him to go after her. Taking Police Car, the three journey to Nuke York, where they visit Dizzy's Aunt Edith. Asking for information about Mok and the Schlepper Brothers, Edith recommends they seek out the Brother's sister, Cindy. It just so happens that Cindy is also in the same building where Angel is being held, and upon finding Angel, simply assumes she's one of 'Mok's girls.' Cindy is planning to sneak out to a local club, and Angel convinces her to take her along. While crawling through the building's duct system, Angel overhears Mok talking with his computer. The computer explains that the voice to open the portal must sing a certain progression of notes. However, there is a way that the portal can be closed. When Mok demands to know how or who can do this, the computer simply responds through the power of 'one heart, one voice, one song.' Angel and Cindy eventually make it to the club, where Omar and the others have also come. However, before they can find Cindy, the Schlepper Brothers find their truant sister and take her away. Omar sees Angel leaving out a side door, and then finds her in the arms of Mok. However, it is revealed to the audience that this was a decoy wearing a mask that resembled Angel's face. Mok returns the real Angel to his place, and shows her that he has captured her bandmates, and is willing to torture them unless she sings for him at his next performance, where he plans to open the portal. Angel agrees, and Mok sends the others back to Ohm-town on a bus, though the shock treatment he has administered has left them in a lucid state. Angel performs in Nuke York, but the portal fails to materialize, with the aftermath resulting in the destruction of the concert hall. Mok checks the computer for what went wrong, and it explains that there was not enough power to allow the portal to materialize. The computer then explains that a suitable power source can be found back in Ohm-Town. Mok returns to Ohm Town to complete his task. When Angel refuses to sing, she is drugged, and chained on stage at the Ohm Town Power Plant. Mok sucks up all the power from the town that he can, and a hole in the floor soon opens up, revealing a pulsating hellbeast that begins to decimate the audience, as well as ends up killing one of the Schlepper Brothers named Zip. Suddenly, a scream rings out, and Omar appears, freeing Angel from her chains. Angel has regained her consciousness, and then attempts to 'sing the creature back.' Singing a song titled 'Send Love Through,' Omar joins her in a duet, fulfilling the conditions of \"one heart, one voice, one song\" to banish the demon, causing the creature to shrink back into the hole from whence it came. Moke desperately tries to stop them, but is thrown into the hole by another of the Schlepper Brothers, upset by the death of Zip. Mok attempts to climb out of the pit, but ends up falling into the abyss as the pit disappears, and the sun rises on a new day outside of the Power Plant.",

         "Unearthed Films just brought this classic out on DVD in a two-disc collector's edition. It's well worth the price! The two-disc set contains the original Canadian version, the altered American version, and the release of \"The Devil and Daniel Mouse\", the inspiration for this movie. Also included are \"making of\" features about both \"Rock and Rule\" and \"Devil\". This movie is animated, but it's not for the very young crowd. It contains animated nudity, occasional adult language, and adult situations such as drug use and death. That said, I first saw it when I was 12 and wasn't scarred for life. This movie's got it all: great music, great animation (far better than \"Heavy Metal\", a similar film, which was released around the same time), and a storyline that appeals to a more mature mindset. If you think of animation as two categories -- anime or \"Care Bears\" style kid stuff -- this doesn't belong in either. It's a uniquely American animation style. And the music! Debby Harry, Iggy Pop, Mick Jagger, Earth Wind & Fire, it goes on and on, a constant stream of music that not only doesn't distract, but is a complement to what's going on on screen. The songs have aged very well in the past 30 years. This movie's a musical, but its music flows naturally, without those \"And now I must stop everything and sing!\" moments that make musicals so tedious. The special effects are also amazing, the more so when you consider when this movie was made. I was one of the people who wrote Nelvana, and then Unearthed, begging for this re-release, and I was one of the first to order the set. I'm happy to say Unearthed has remained true to Nelvana's vision -- this set is everything I hoped it'd be. Don't miss it.",
         "I have to say, I was very excited when I learned that this movie was going to be released on DVD. I vaguely remember seeing this as a 10 year old in the 1980s and being impressed (granted, as a 10 year old). So I rented it last night and was overall disappointed, but I must say its probably because I had over-hyped it with my own cloudy memories. I found the animation and the general artwork to be very impressive. The songs were fantastic, especially \"My Name is Mok\", but I found the characters to be generally annoying and the story lacking much development. Mok was the only character who was interesting and entertaining. Omar was a self-absorbed narcissist who doesn't give the audience a reason to empathize. Omar's companions were overly juvenile as were Mok's assistants. The story has a great basis--dangerous post-apocalyptic world of mutants. But we don't really get much of a feeling for this world beyond the initial set-up. Also, we know that Mok wants to raise a demon, but why? Did I miss it or is it never really stated? I assume he wants to dominate the world, but it seems to me that he pretty much does already. Overall, the movie is lacking character development and follow through on the story. The music is fantastic and the animation is great. Its kind of a mixed bag. I only wish it had lived up to my expectations.",
         "A very well made animated film that has garnered a cult following. The animation was groundbreaking for its day. The film features music by Cheap Trick and Blondie but the songs never seemed particularly awe inspiring to me. I enjoyed the storyline, and the post-apocalyptic style of the film worked well and fit with some of the humor in the film. The animation is very psychedelic in the way it is presented, and this unique added a lot to my enjoyment of the film. Overall, I thought it was a very fun film.",
         "I was never fortunate enough to catch this film on the big screen. However, I did see it on cable in '86 and have been keeping my eyes open for a copy ever since. Having found an old bootleg recently, I was pleased that the animation is still truly amazing and has held up well over the years. The soundtrack is equally fine. Being a fan of stories with an apocolyptic bent, I really enjoyed this particular film. My friends and I still quote various parts of the film even after all this time. While the story is a little short, I feel it captures some of the frustration of being in a small-town band that is trying to break out. That and the fact this band must battle a vast evil is an interesting angle. Please won't someone re-release this diamond in the rough?",
         "In a post-apocalyptic future, (or if you watch the Candian version, \"Another time...Another place) Mok, a legendary megolaniacal rock superstar who appears to have fallen somewhat, but not totally out of flavor, kidnaps Angel, a new female rocker, to sing for him to open a portal into a darker dimension. It's up to Angel's band mates to save her from Mok's evil clutches in this Canadian produced animated sci-fi musical. The story and plotting seem a bit on the archaic side, but the music is superb (escpecially from Lou Reed and Debbie Harry) and the animation is pretty good. That's enough to make me recommend this film, but I still believe that the earlier \"Heavy Metal\" is a better overall experience. My Grade: B- DVD Extras: Disc 1) 77 minute version; Commentary with Directory Clive Smith; 24 and a half minute Making of; Character sketch Gallery; Restoration Comparisons Disk 2) 81 minute CBC version; \"The Devil and Daniel Mouse\" short; a Making of said short; \"Drats\" work print; Rock and Rule Title Workprint; more sketch galleries; Theatrical Trailer; and Trailer for \"Electric Dragon 80000V\" DVD-Rom content: the original screenplay in .PDF format",
         "Ah, my childhood in the 80's. I recall staying up until dawn watching the marvel we've come to know as CABLE TELEVISION (which I was still exploring at the time). And THIS was one of those unforgettables they showed at 2am on Showtime (which was actually quite good). Music fans will embrace this movie for the soundtrack - Lou Reed, Cheap Trick, Blondie, even Earth Wind & Fire! The songs are catchy and upon a couple of listens WILL stay in your head! ***Funny enough, R&R would come off like something you'd hear as a reference in a cartoon like Family Guy (who are FAMOUS for its numerous 80's and pop culture references disguised as \"private jokes\" for those who \"were there.\") Peter Griffin (sifting through video collection: \"Let's see - Electric Dreams... Heavy Metal... Animalympics... Space Camp... HERE WE ARE - Rock & Rule!\"*** Even the film itself has references to Rock & Roll, such as the sinister MOK, who is the \"what-if result if you threw Iggy Pop, Mick Jagger, and David Bowie into a blender.\" EVIL INDEED! :) I won't say it was a 10 though... it's a basic guy-saves-girl story, but one with a rolling plot, gritty animation, and (like I said before) a great soundtrack! I will say it was the better of \"midnight movies\" I've seen, and I-CAN'T-WAIT for a DVD release (which is rumored to be available in 1st Qtr. 2005)! I hope you get to see Rock & Rule and join us many breakroom \"insider jokes\" to come (Hot dogs and sushi? You're not my kind). -Jes'",
         "Rock & Rule was put out of print back in 1985 shortly after its first video run. Since then it has not really seen the light of day, other than on ebay auctions, random TV sightings, and most recently on Bit Torrent. Now, with a two disc special edition DVD being released, it is finally time for this film to get the attention it deserves. Rock & Rule most likely failed because it was released in a time when animation was still dominated by the Disney/Children's market. Ralph Bakshi had a few successful films in the 70's, but as the 80's came along, he failed. Transformers (another PG animated film) failed. There were so many experimental animated films coming out, but none of them were successful, just because of its more adult-like content. Rock & Rule isn't as extreme as say some of the Bakshi film are. But, there is a strange use of drugs (with orb-like balls) in the film, sexual innuendos, language, etc., But, nothing a young teen couldn't handle. Our story begins with some information about a war that is long passed. Humans don't exist anymore. What we have now are mutant evolutions of street animals (dogs, cats, rats, etc.,). We are introduced to Mok. He's an Iggy Pop/David Bowie sort of character. His music career is somewhat going under. It isn't as strong as it used to be. He stumbles unto a secret code that can only be un-locked with a certain key. That key is the perfect voice. Once this code is unlocked, a beast will come and destroy all that Mok wants to be destroyed. He stumbles upon a struggling band in his local town led by Omar and Angel. Omar sings the first song. Then Angel sings the second. When Mok hears this, he discovers the perfect voice. So, he does a little heist and kidnaps her and takes her to \"Nuke York\" to perform. After Omar and his friends wake up from a drug-haze, they travel to Nuke York to try and save her. Animation is splendid for its time. Crazy visuals. Especially during the \"Triumph\" scene. It's almost like a psychedelic trip. The music is also great, featuring Cheap Trick, Earth Wind and fire, Iggy Pop, etc., I suggest any fan of animation check this out once it comes out on DVD (whenever that may be, but it will be soon). It ain't a cult classic amongst true animation fans for nothing!",
         "Well, I can see that here is about the same as in the real world, about three people have ever heard of this movie. That's a shame too, the Cheap Trick songs alone make it worthwhile. I would have to say if you stumbled upon this and have never seen it go try to track it down if you are into animation or good ol' Eighty's rock. Great story, great animation, great voiceovers, great songs = great movie. In my opinion, I would have to put this movie above Heavy Metal in comparison with viewability. This movie I could watch over and over, Heavy Metal always puts me to sleep near the end now. That is probably because this is one complete story instead of some short stories put together for a movie. 10 out of 10 here... By the way, to all you aspiring animators out there; can you guess what they used to give the Creature that gelatinous look? (Yeeech, you probably don't want to know)",
         "I first saw this movie back in '85 on HBO and I LOVED it! (I managed to tape it, but someone stole it from me!) The art is great, the music superb, and the storyline is intriguing! I've managed to find some of the songs online (with alternate lyrics) I agree that its a shame that Nelvana doesn't seem to think releasing this on DVD is worthwhile. I managed to find a genuine VHS copy at a flea market (for $3) back in '94 and I've held on to it ever since!! :) the box is very worn and slightly damaged, though. Rock and Rule is on a par with some of the best Anime on the market today! I showed it to a local Anime club, and they loved it and asked where they could acquire a copy as well...See Nelvana? You could still have a moneymaker there.....",
         "\"Rock & Rule\" is a lost classic of American animation featuring some of the best rock musicians of the early 80's, including Deborah Harry, Cheap Trick, Iggy Pop, Lou Reed, and Earth, Wind, and Fire. In addition to the best American animation of the 1980's, the film features a terrific rock score, excellent voice acting, and an impressive screenplay which is a wicked satire on the music industry, animated films, and the cyberpunk genre. But what do you expect from a post-apocalyptic cyberpunk rock opera with 'funny animal' characters and overtones of H.P. Lovecraft? See you at the MOK Concert at Carnage Hall!"
