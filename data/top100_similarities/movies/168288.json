      "synopsis": "Bogota, Colombia Mike Milch (John Gallagher, Jr.) is on his way to work while driving down a crowded street. He is approached at his car by a man in town who offers him a figure made from an old corncob. Mike buys one from the man. Mike arrives at his job, Belko Industries. The company COO Barry Norris (Tony Goldwyn) pulls up to find armed guards at the entrance asking to see ID. As he enters the building, we meet other Belko employees who have been working there for over a year. Mike goes to his girlfriend, Leandra Florez (Adria Arjona), who is in the process of getting divorced. Leandra is constantly harassed by Wendell Dukes (John C. McGinley), who doesn't get she's not interested. There is new employee Dany Wilkins (Melonie Diaz), who is told that the employees all have trackers placed in their heads for the higher-ups to keep an eye on them, due to the high number of kidnappings that occur in Colombia. Dany becomes acquainted with Roberto Jerez (David Del Rio) and Leota Hynek (Gail Bean). Not long into the day, the local employees are sent home, and a mysterious voice (Gregg Henry) speaks over the intercom telling the employees that within 8 hours, most of them will be dead. In 30 minutes, they are required to kill two people, or else more will die. The building is then completely sealed off by metal on all the doors and windows. Everybody becomes nervous and tense, while Barry tries to keep everyone calm. People play it off as a sick prank. Maintenance workers Bud Melks (Michael Rooker) and Lonny Crane (David Dastmalchian) try to melt the metal off with the blowtorch, but the metal is apparently too strong for it to have any sort of effect. Dany, Roberto, Leota, and tech guy Keith McClure (Josh Brener) to go the roof to find cafeteria worker Marty Espenscheid (Sean Gunn) smoking a joint up there with two of his friends. As they discuss the situation, one of Marty's friends dies when the back of her head explodes. The others freak out, while in the lobby, three more people die with their skulls getting blown out. The other employees panic, thinking someone is shooting at them. Upon further inspection, the employees learn that the trackers in their heads are set to explode. Mike goes into the bathroom to try and cut his out, only for The Voice to speak and order him to stop trying to take it out or they will detonate it on their own. Mike stops at the last second as Leandra begs him to stop. The Voice then states that they are not messing around, and now it is demanded that the employees kill 30 among them within two hours, or 60 will be killed. The employees start to weigh their options, as some of them cannot bring themselves to killing anyone else. Barry, however, is set to make it home to his wife and kids, so he tries to get security guard Evan Smith (James Earl) to give him the keys to the armory. Evan refuses to do so after he just witnessed one of his fellow guards and friend get killed by the explosive. In the basement, Lonny is freaking out as Bud tries to calm him down. Bud gets too close, and Lonny reacts by hitting Bud in the head with a wrench, leaving a huge dent in Bud's head as he dies. Dany, who was hiding, witnesses the whole thing. Lonny tries to stop her from telling anyone and he grabs her. Dany kicks herself back and causes Lonny to back his head into a metal bar, killing him. Mike, Leandra, and Evan split up while Barry, Wendell, and Terry Winters (Owain Yeoman) work together to try and break into the armory with a blowtorch. Evan tries to stop them by pulling out his gun, but he relents and must let them continue. Mike takes Evan's gun and shoots the blowtorch tank before he leaves with Leandra and Evan. The three meet up with Keith, Leota, and Roberto to make signs to hang over the building to call for help. The guards in the hangar spot them and start shooting at them, hitting Keith in his hand. The Voice demands them to stop hanging up signs, or their explosives will go off. Mike and his friends start to head back downstairs, but Mike gets knocked in the head with a fire extinguisher by Barry. In the heat of the moment, Wendell stabs Evan and takes his keys. Evan suffers as bleeds out. Barry and his guys get the guns out and start ordering people to head into the lobby as they get down to less than 20 minutes before their deadline. They begin to group people according to whether or not they have kids or if they are over the age of 60. Mike is then brought in after he regains consciousness. Barry and Wendell start executing people, and Terry nearly gets to Mike until Dany cuts off the power in the basement. Barry, Wendell, and some of their goons start shooting in the dark while others make it out safely. The Voice speaks over the intercom saying that time is up and they have only killed 29 people. 31 additional people have their heads blown out, including Keith and Leota. Everyone else hides. The Voice speaks again and says the third round of their game will have the employees with the most kills walk out free. So far, Barry and Wendell have the most kills, so they go off to try and up that count by killing everyone they come across. One woman tries to offer her body to Barry for her life. He responds by twisting her neck backwards. Barry gets into an elevator as Dany and Roberto try to make their way up on top. Dany gets off the top but Roberto gets crushed by the elevator, leaving Barry stuck. Dany climbs to the other side to get out. Leandra finds Marty and his friend Chet (Abraham Benrubi) in the cafeteria where numerous bodies are laid out. Marty and Chet dug the bombs out of the heads of those who didn't get their skulls blown out. Wendell shows up and starts shooting. Leandra hides behind a table with Marty and Chet, but those two get shot dead by Wendell. Leandra makes her way over to Wendell and starts swinging an axe down into his face. Mike and Leandra find each other and evade one employee who is flinging Molotov cocktails, and Barry wielding his gun. Barry shoots Dany in the head as she comes out of the elevator. The Molotov guy gets shot too. Unfortunately, so does Leandra. She dies next to Mike before he steps out in a rage and goes after Barry. The two fight until Mike grabs hold of a tape dispenser and starts bashing Barry's head in. Mike is then the sole survivor. The guards come in and pull him out. Mike is brought into the hangar, where he meets The Voice himself, a man whose face is partially scarred. He tells Mike that the experiment was to observe human behavior in this type of experiment. Mike then reveals that he took the bombs that Marty dug out and slipped them onto the guards and The Voice. He runs to the control panel and sets them off, then shoots two other goons. The Voice tries to talk Mike out of it, but he has none of it and shoots The Voice man dead. Mike walks out of the building. The camera pans out to reveal other screens from dozens of other Belko companies where other survivors have completed their own ordeal. Another voice then commences \"Phase 2.\"",

         "Eighty American workers in Bogota get locked inside their office building and an announcement over the intercom gives them half an hour to kill any two of the employees. When they don't comply, the rules are amped up, and an American Battle Royale (down to the 'collars') ensues. The Belko Experiment managed to accomplish the difficult feat of never being boring, not even for a minute. It takes almost no time getting going, and at any given moment it is either action packed, or taking a break from action and descending into dark humour. Both of these were well-executed, with one particularly memorable action piece (the end of round 2, so pretty), and a spattering of interesting side characters, a lot of them hilarious in either attitude or demeanor. With that, it managed to entertain throughout, making it worth seeing. However, where it fails is originality. The Battle Royale formula has been done time and time again, and here we get the straightest form of it, with zero deviation from the norm and zero unique perspective. Where a movie like Circle tries to infuse some kind of basic examinations of social themes, here there is no higher level to the killings. And for this, the movie never once surprises with a thought or an event. The characters are just shells of people; the bad guys are caricatures of evil, the protagonists of good. There is never ambiguity of character, in a movie where so much moral ambiguity should be present due to the situation. So from minute one you know exactly who will be a villain and who will be a hero, and the end game is obvious from the start. It's a waiting game for the movie to arrive where you know it is going, which makes it very unsatisfying once the action is over.",
         "The set up for the movie had a somewhat interesting concept at its core: what do people do when they are trapped in a situation where the only way out is to kill others? Not a completely original idea, but it has some potential to be thought provoking if there is some kind of message it is trying to send, or some aspect of society it is trying to satirize. The resulting bloodbath is well executed, if you are into seeing office workers murder each other. I can't tell if the movie has a messed up sense of humor, or if a few people in the theater with me just thought some of the deaths were so ridiculous it was funny. Personally I never found any of the deaths over the top ENOUGH to truly find them funny, so the other people's laughter just kind of made me uncomfortable... After the bloodbath ends though, ultimately there was nothing there, no deep thoughts, no important message, no point at all really. The closest thing I can up with for meaning in the movie is that in the end, they basically admit there was no real reason for the experiment to be conducted, and so conducting cruel experiments without a purpose is a bad thing? But that seems obvious, right? When chaos ensues, different people react in different ways. It's sort of like the Walking Dead in that sense, but the Walking Dead has time to develop its themes and characters long enough for you to extract some meaning. In a way, the pointlessness of the experiment and the killing is reflected in the pointlessness of the movie itself. I don't know if that's kind of meta, or just a waste of time, but yeah, if you skip this movie, you won't be missing much except seeing a lot of talented actors who always play supporting roles murder each other in the center stage. If you want to see John Ghallager Jr in something better, watch Hush, or The Newsroom. If you want to see Meryl from the Walking Dead, watch The Walking Dead. If you want to see the ideas this movie brings up actually addressed in a thought provoking way, maybe try the Hunger Games, or Battle Royale. This was a fun little film that ultimately means very little.",
         "Let's get one thing out the way: this is horror for the masses, in the worst possible meaning of such definition. It's domesticated, neutered, lowest common denominator, watered down horror at its worst and, as such, is a bar lowerer for the whole genre. With that said, here's a list of adjectives and definitions that passed through my mind while I was watching this: unfocused, half-baked, hypocritical, unrealistic af, lame, predictable, stupid to the point of being downright offensive, heavy handed, useless. Mostly hypocritical (for what it tries to say about \"human nature\") and useless, anyway. The only positives are that is generally well acted (with a tragic waste of John C. McGinley) while featuring some beautiful shots (nothing to write home about, though) and it's not shy on gore (for a mainstream movie). These, along with some humor here and there, are the only reason why I'm giving it 4/10 instead of 1. The story has been done to death in countless other movies, novels, short stories, comic books, TV shows and video games (so, for the geniuses claiming this is a rip-off of danganronpa: yeah, no. That game is as much as rip off of other, better things, than this is). If you want some examples of movies that do the same kind of storyline, only way better than this: \"Cube\" (1997), \"The Experiment\" (both the German original, 2001 and the American remake, 2010), \"The Mist\" (2007) or any adaptation of \"Lord of the Flies\", really.",
         "One of the worst movies i've seen this year. The story is just ridiculous and the acting horrendous. A bunch of employees go to work on a normal day, only things take a turn for the worse and the soon find out the whole building is on shut down, and they have to kill each other to survive. The company has put microchips in all the employees, and use them to explode the people when they don't follow instructions ( sound familiar) The plot is really bad and the so called twist at the end is even worse. Its so predictable what's going to happen, and eventually they all die except the good guy, who happens to plant the explosives on all the culprits at the end and blow them all up. How would the explosive still work if it had already been detonated before???? how didn't they see this on the cameras, they were quite obviously dissecting people's heads getting these things out, didn't they wonder what was going on? It was really bad, don't waste your time on this movie, its not worth the time watching it.",
         "You know the story. Heads explode, people are stabbed, sliced, and shot. I'd rather see 'Final Destination' type creativity with this sub- genre. It's decent enough to watch. Nothing to rush out and see right away, though. Gore without creativity no longer amuses me. It once did. But I'm a grow ass man, now. Please hit the \"this review was not helpful\" button. I love that. I try to give an honest opinion about a film and people are going to hate on it. It is what it is. But, this movie was mediocre at best.",
         "The strongest part of this film is its premise. It's really fantastic. There is so much possibility for this fun, satirical look at what people will do in certain situations. The film is really filled to the brim with brilliant possibilities. But for the most part, they remain just possibilities. I do think this is a really good script. However, I don't think the execution of this screenplay was as good as if could've been. The characters making decisions and breaking off into groups could have been fascinating and riveting, but it didn't reach the level it should have. The actual streaks of killing could have been so cool to watch, but it comes off as kind of dull. Where the action could have been really inventive and insane, in a Kingsman: The Secret Service kind of way, it ends up being rather rudimentary and bland. There isn't nearly as much electricity or excitement in this film as it deserved to have...",
         "The Belko Experiment is a messed up film and it's wildly entertaining. The Belko Experiment is an indie film that's essentially about a office building that gets shut down and the people inside are forced to kill each other. Here's the good. The story in this movie keeps you on the edge of your seat practically the whole run time of the movie. It's a physiological horror film that really asks the audience, \"What would you do in this situation?\". I was lucky enough to be at a screening of the film with writer/producer James Gunn and the director Greg McLean and most of the cast. They talked a lot about how there was no villain in this movie, which is something I loved. The people in this movie were all acting for themselves, doing what they need to do for their family or for survival. The story in the beginning and the middle is very interesting and will keep the audience entertained well after the movie is over. The acting is this movie is, for the most part, believable and good. Tony Goldwyn, John Gallagher Jr., and Sean Gunn were the standouts of this movie. Tony was terrifying, and just as he talked about during the Q and A at the screening, his character wasn't a villain. His character was doing what he had to do to make sure he could come home to his family again, even if is terrible. John Gallagher Jr. does a fantastic job as the main character. He displays a wide variety of emotions perfectly and pulls off a really really good performance, surpassing his acting in 12 Cloverfield Lane. The real standout of this movie is Sean Gunn who did a fantastic job with his character. He has some of the best and most memorable lines in the whole film. It's amazing to see how far Sean Gunn has gone in his acting ability when compared to his role in James Gunn's Super. Everyone in the movie, including the extras, pulled off great performances. The technical parts of this movie are very well done. I have tons of respect for this movie's use of practical effects which added a lot of horror to the movie's tone. The cinematography in this movie was impressive, keeping a lot of shots close to give off a claustrophobic feeling. The lighting in this movie is used perfectly. Towards the latter half of the movie, many action sequences were lit uniquely. A action scene lit by a neon light and fire or a flickering light, whatever the case, it built the suspense. Here's the bad. The ending of this film is different. It didn't really set up the ending all that well and left the audience wanting something a bit more. It didn't ruin the fun of the movie but with a better ending it could have been a lot better. For a movie to me great it needs to have an ending that leaves the audience satisfied and this movie has trouble doing that. Overall, The Belko Experiment is a thrill ride. When the action and horror and suspense hits, it hits hard. The acting from everyone is entertaining and believable, many performances being especially good. The lighting and cinematography add a lot to the overall tone of the film which makes it a lot more effective. While the ending leaves you wanting more, you'll still be thinking about this movie for days to come.",
         "Stuffed with characters you just don't give a damn about, and smearing the office floor with blood & corpses that keep on piling as plot progresses, The Belko Experiment teases with an interesting idea but it's executed in such an uninteresting fashion that it finishes as yet another forgettable example of its kind. The Belko Experiment unfolds in a remote office building where all its employees find themselves trapped in the edifice once day and are forced to participate in a sadistic game of \"kill or be killed\" by an unknown voice on the company's intercom, eventually realising it to be a social experiment they never signed up for. Written by James Gunn & directed by Greg McLean, the film sets its premise quickly, introducing its relevant characters in a hurried manner, and once bodies begin to go down, it never stops until the very end. The concept, although unoriginal, isn't entirely terrible but its translation on the film canvas is, for nothing about it stands out. Characters are mere caricatures, a romantic subplot is unnecessarily added, dialogues are terrible, and although it doesn't hold back on violence & gore, it doesn't leave much of an impression in the end, for neither the plot nor the characters are compelling. Performances aren't any good either as the cast has nothing in script to build their work upon. On an overall scale, The Belko Experiment is an incompetently directed, shoddily written & poorly performed horror, and is never for once intriguing. It is one of those movies that are forgotten the moment they end, and sitting through it isn't a breeze either. Dull, uninspiring & laughable, it is a failed experiment that brings nothing new to the table but may still fascinate those who don't mind the lack of a sturdy plot as long as they get their required dose of on-screen barbarity.",
         "This review of The Belo Experiment is spoiler free *** (3/5) BEFORE HE CLEANED his writing for the family-friendly blockbuster Guardians of the Galaxy (both volumes), writer-director James Gunn conducted the script to The Belko Experiment. A horror slasher/whodunit thriller. Both forming the two sides of Gunn, however before he had blockbusting scripture he was known as a horror writer, writing and directing the dark, Slither, and the uncompromisingly silly Super. This perhaps brought influence to Zack Snyder for Watchmen. For this Gunn left the directing to Wolf Creek's Greg McLean, making this a winning combination between writer and director and for a while at least it succeeds. Plot wise, it's The Hunger Games franchise meets The Purge, happily there are few things this has in common with them, merciless rules, a time limit to kill and intriguing characterization. Not only does the company but also the title of the film itself screams government, a huge of security, a locked gate and a tall building a mile from civilization. There's a menacing company boss (Tony Goldwyn), who will do anything to keep his workers calm but when it comes to it he sacrifices others. And just on the outside in an abandoned hanger there is a team of tight-knit killers who have clever gadgets, with buttons and names of the employees and an unknown voice announcing a game of kill or be killed, the most satisfying part; there a whole bunch of people that are killed from micro chipped bombs. Theoretically the exploding head technique works for a while, it's stunning to look at (in a merciless way) but after a while it becomes monotonous, painting rooms with blood and skull remnants all over the floor. There are changes in the killing strategy that come slightly too late though in some cases later is better, here that works when players are used as cannon fodder, perhaps leading the film to a predictable end but it's thrilling all the same. On the other hand Gunn is a wonderful writer, his screenplay is clever, has some silly moments but that's what made his blockbuster good, because it had silly moments. There is a bunch of that here, while for most of the time it stays mostly serious, implementing a balanced screenplay. Even though practically everything you see here has been done before, the merciless killings and the player panic The Belko Experiment is a surprisingly enjoyable thriller with a lot of polished cred (the writer and the director), the style and the solid performances. VERDICT: A brutally, bloody Battle Royale that gives tension, style and a lot of cred. That glides along nicely through, until a disappointing dip in the second half. Still, there are plenty of positive points, the brutal violence, the polished style and the solid performances to enjoy.",
         "The concept of director Greg McLean and producer/writer James Gunn's THE BELKO EXPERIMENT won't seem overly original to those who've seen BATTLE ROYALE or really any movie in which people are forced to hunt or kill folks they know and like, but in Gunn's hands it's a whole lot more fun: office workers for a Bogota-based non-profit are trapped in their shiny office tower and told by a mysterious intercom voice that they've got to murder a certain number of their own before a pre-determined deadline or double that number will be killed via the company's \"alternate method\". To prove the seriousness of the situation, several employees' heads are suddenly ripped open by a mysterious force. After several attempts at teamwork to devise methods of contacting the outside world result in even more bodies as punishment, some of the (literally) more mercenary members of the management team decide that the voice sort of has a point, and set about liberating several handguns from a downstairs vault, not long after other sluggos have raided the cafeteria of its sharpest utensils. Not surprisingly, Gunn's script establishes a firm balance between action, horror and organic comedy -- bother Sean gets some of the biggest laughs as the corporation's resident stoner and conspiracy theorist, who leads his own little squadron of three for much of the film -- and he and McLean have assembled a such a strong, fan-friendly cast of familiar heavies (Michael Rooker! Tony Goldwyn! Gregg Henry! John C. McGinley!), lesser-knowns and newcomers to play this likable, believable group of office drones that they're able to smartly subvert expectations on a number of occasions. The body count is extremely high -- most of them on screen -- and the blood and gore is plentiful and extremely well-crafted, but it wisely isn't lingered on and there's no off-putting, drawn-out torture scenes to speak of. Mind you, a few of the most audience-pleasing kills are exceptionally squishy, so I could see this eventually hitting DVD and streaming in R and unrated versions. The TIFF audience saw the unrated version for sure last night, so plenty of cheers all around when some of the most devious players met their makers. This is a great \"what would you do\" kind of show, and I'd imagine a lot of genre fans will get a huge kick out of it.",
         "Fist of all, I don't consider this a horror movie. It really doesn't contain those building blocks of a proper horror. It is not even a thrilling thriller. Just a big mass i could not put together. In my opinion, just a producers bad try to use psychology to rise a popularity. Some scenes I found ridiculous and I actually laughed at. Gore and blood is one of the reasons i didn't vote \"awful\". There are grouse moments but as nearly enough to call this at least a good thriller (this movie just cant be a horror). The only frightening scene was the bare ending and that is all! Simply saying, a big miss in imitating a Shutter Island.",
         "The Belko Experiment pits an entire office building against one another during, what seems to be, a government experiment that puts 75+ people in an office building and an announcer tells them to kill one another or hardcore ramifications will follow for not obeying the order. When you break it down, this is a film that just sounds stupid in the best way possible. It is fun, violent, gory and, at times, thoroughly enjoyable as a passable thriller. Anyone looking for the gold that James Gunn struck with Guardians of the Galaxy or even Slither will walk away disappointed. Those of you who enjoyed the director's work on Wolf Creek will probably be happy with this. For me, it's hard to give thoughts on a film like this because it is so obvious that the filmmakers didn't give a damn about impressing anyone. For that, I've got to give kudos to Gunn and McLean. They know their audience. This is far from a movie that will turn you into a fan of horror or thriller. This is the type of film that you just sit back, turn your brain off, and try to be entertained. There is not artistic value in this film. This is a balls to the wall thriller that works for anybody looking to waste 90 minutes or so. With that being said, there are still some frustrating moments in the film. The film plays out very black and white. We know who is who and where they stand in the experiment. So right away, we know who to care about and who not to. This was something that I didn't really care for with this film. I wanted to be surprised, I wanted to be wondering who was going to make what decision. Instead, it all ends up being very predictable. While what i just mentioned is extremely vague, it is hard to really go off about the film without giving major spoilers but those of you who have seen any of the Red Band trailers probably know what I'm talking about. Overall, The Belko Experiment is a gory thriller that is almost a lot of fun. It has every ingredient there for a tight, great little thriller. Unfortunately, director Greg McLean repeats what he did on Wolf Creek and let's us stew in gore instead of deep and layered characters. For a film like this, that is what anybody could expect. Personally, I would have liked to have seen something a little different than what was expected. Either way, this movie is a lot of fun and a good way to waste some time. Other than that, The Belko Experiment comes up a little short.",
         "The Belko Experiment is a nasty, gory, chaotic little horror film that pits an office building full of co-workers against each other in a bloody battle of last man/woman standing. This much you probably already know from the trailer. It's a plot that can be succinctly surmised on a cocktail napkin so it's not like you need much to prime you for what's to occur. What they don't tell you however is The Belko Experiment is a nasty, gory and chaotic little horror film without a center. Hunger Games (2012) meets Office Space (1999)? More like Severance (2006) meets a sad, angry teenager's school shooting fantasy. We catch our first glimpse of our inevitable victims within hours of the titular experiment. There's the office Jim and Pam (Arjona), a couple of one-trick pony side characters that might just make it to the second act (Gunn, Brener, Del Rio), the obvious District 2 sociopaths (Goldwyn, McGinley, Yeoman) and, of course, the mousy office Milton (Diaz) who's just so excited to be starting her first day at the office. It's obvious within the first five minutes which archetypes are going to make it to the top ten, the question becomes, will the other seventy or so office drones be in on the fun or not. Without spoiling too much for the misguided Purge (2013)-o-philes who still want to watch this trash, I'm sorry to say that The Belko Experiment errs on the side of seriousness and pessimism instead of black comedy or pressure-cooker sensationalism. Any lurid fun that can be had at the expense of cubicle flunkies taking out long-seeded frustrations on their managers or visa versa takes a back seat to the actions and motivations of a selective few who camp out on their respective floors hatching their schemes. The films creativity (or lack thereof) is so markedly uninspired that it might as well write \"You'll Get the Point and Little Else Within the Hour\" in big banner lettering. As chaos looms, factions quickly form. Not so much organically, but more as a way of sussing out the good guys from the bad for the sake of the story. Representing team \"give a s**t\" is the amiable Mike (Gallagher) who walks through the blood splattered cork-board of Belko Industries with a halo around his head despite being a bit of an airhead. He's the kind of guy who'd tell everyone to take the stairs instead of the elevator because it's safer. He's the kind of guy who is a salt and pepper mustache away from being Sully Sullenberger; a goody-two-shoes whose persona is so mundane and diametrically opposed to any of the larger-than-life villains that it just reeks of lazy characterization. On the other side of the divide is Barry (Goldwyn) who is \"open to all options,\" so long as those options leave him in control. His arc is a little more nuanced than Mike's but given his title and the company that he keeps, I'm amazed the audience's goodwill got as far as the building's dirt parking lot. We all know he's bad and every discussion had in the building cafeteria mulling over what do to is shaded by his badness - life and family be damned. They're all damned really, though because the lions share of the office has little to no say on how they meet their demise it never seems to matter all that much. The fact that the movie literally lines people up for the slaughter should tell you all you need to know about how repetitive this movie is. For real: Battle Royale (2000), a film with five times more protagonists, still managed to stuff in more plot, meaning and dignity into its story than this film managed to imbue in twelve floors and a murder of recognizable character actors. The Belko Experiment is a grim, mean, repetitive, slog of a movie that takes all the moral, psychological and political subtext of James Gunn's high-concept and smashes them like watermelons bracing against Gallagher's sledge-o-matic. The ends of this cruel little experiment hints at a sequel, the results of which may give this movie some closure. As of now however, the message I heard loud and clear by the end of this mess was, \"watch this movie, and we'll make three more just like it.\" Rise above people, rise above.",
         "Don't bother watching this visually disturbing piece of crap movie. Very violent graphics. Ordinary story line. Supposedly a sequel for this planned!! so, would advise not wasting your time over this, better watch something else! To give you a hint on the story line, people are locked in an office and go on a rampage killing each other.",
         "I don't usually let reviews over here but man... this is one of the most idiotic movies I've ever seen. Budget $5 million? Five? Five Million Dollars? For what? For 5 tons of ketchup? There are millions of ideas to make a movie with less than $5 million dollars and actually good. I'm very sorry to say that but again... this is the most stupid movie I've seen so far. And I have one question: who the hell does this even if it's a real situation?! No man... I cannot give a better rating. Even 1 is too much. Sorry, but it's awful.",
         "It starts as a normal day for employees of an American company in Colombia. Suddenly blast walls are lowered in the small office tower, exits are closed and a malevolent voice over the public address system orders people to kill or be killed. A few have to die before it is believed that this voice means business. Soon it is hand to hand combat and survival of the fittest among maintenance, management, IT nerds and the rest of the workers. Weapons are in plentiful supply. So are theories as to how and why this is happening, what to do in response to the commands and whether people should band together or fight for themselves. This intense, violent, funny and unpredictable film is fueled by capable actors and an intriguing plot. It says a lot about human nature. People divide into two camps; the manipulators and those with empathy for others. Yet both types tend to die when the lights go out and the blast walls go down. The unexpected twists to the story are wonderful and plentiful. Characters that I assumed would live, instead die gruesome deaths. What detracted from the film is that there was little depth to the dialogue and the film was not shot where it was set (Colombia). World premiere seen at the 2016 Toronto International Film Festival.",
         "80 employees are locked inside a large building. A voice orders them over the intercom to kill two of their workmates within an hour. They are later ordered to kill 30 more within two hours, or else 60 will be killed. Small tracking devices have been implanted in their occiputs. The tracking devices are made to explode. The Belko Experiment is not unlike disaster films, in which a certain number of people are locked inside a building or a ship. The viewers become familiar with the characters. We get attached to some of them and hope they will survive. The questions are: Who will survive and who will not survive? Who keep a cool head and who become desperate? These questions also apply to this movie. Moreover, in such crisis situations, self-appointed and wise leaders, who are good at improvising, emerge. The less wise lose their lives because of heedlessness. You may very well look upon \"The Belko Experiment\" as an adult version of \"Lord of the Flies\", William Golding's novel about school boys marooned on a remote island. They are eventually divided into two groups. The members of one group , led by Ralph, want to remain civilized. The members of the other group, led by Jack, degenerate into savagery. The employees of \"The Belko Experiment\" are also divided into such groups. The Ralph character in this film is Mike Milch, while the Jack character is Belco's chief operating officer Barry Norris. Eventually the differences between the two groups are wiped out. The \"civilized\" also kill, but in self-defense. Such an experiment has never taken place in reality, and it is impossible to know if the film is credible or not. I longed for a psychological explanation of why the different employees chose the way they did. The screen writer has probably no talent for psychology. It was expected that the impudent Wendell Dukes, who didn't take a no for an answer from a female workmate, should end up in the \"wrong\" group. However, it would have been more effective if he to everyone's surprise had landed on the \"right\" side, to prove that there could be something good in such men as well. Screen writer James Gunn, with two films about \"Scoobi Doo\" on his list, is no William Golding. Gunn will never be awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, as was the case with Golding. The boys in \"Lord of the Flies\" drop into savagery after staying on the island for several weeks or months. In \"The Belko Experiment\" it happens after a very short time. Yes, I really wonder how likely it is. Eventually, the film turns out to be a big murder spree. Clenched skulls and blood drooling from mouths eventually become common. Barry and his group don't just shoot people, they chop them with axes too. In fact, I feel that the idea of an experiment really was used as a pretext to give the viewers one and a half hour of killing. Who did I like best? Yes, most charming was the Laurel and Hardy-like couple Marty Espenscheid and Chet Valincou.",
         "Threadbare plot of a group of people who are locked in an eight storey office building in Bogota, Columbia, and being forced to kill a specific number of each other by an unseen, poorly defined enemy in order for the rest to survive, takes a backseat to violence and gore, in this blood- drenched, wannabe thriller/ horror. Anyone who has read any of my earlier reviews can see that I have little problem with watching something gory, if the plot can make it amusing, and grab my attention, which this didn't, hence the 2/ 10 rating. This film's first ten minutes seems like it will be a silly office comedy, before abruptly switching gears, and after so little of a setup, I found it difficult to care when one of its innumerable characters were killed. Most characters were just standing in the background, existing only to be killed, before its Cabin In The Woods- inspired ending drives everyone from the cinema (and I'm not joking, when the film ended, the 2/3 full auditorium was vacated within seconds) The film makes little sense, features incredibly out of place uses of an awful cover of California Dreaming, and largely unfunny attempts at humour sink it even further, making its one hour and twenty-odd minutes run seem much longer than it really is. (Furthermore, if you take out the opening and closing credits, the film would only be an hour and a few minutes long) Filmed in June and July 2015, was shown once at the Toronto International Film Festival, but the not released until March 2017.",
         "It's so dumb, it's DUMBDUMB! I have to write three lines of text about this movie, so here it goes. I saw a bunch of good actors in this film, so that means the director FAILED in making this a good movie. I could have directed this film a thousand times better than the director of this film. Mainly because I love films. I realize that directors have a certain time to make a film, but this film is the reason why they should be given more time.",
         "After watching I do believe that \"The Belko Experiment\" would've been a much better film overall under the direction of James Gunn. I don't think Greg McLean does full justice to Gunn's script and the \"Experiment\" fell a bit short, at least for me. Its not a bad movie in any aspect but for me it lacked the extra detail and effort to make it something above average. The acting is just fine. Aside from the main character Mike - played by John Gallagher, Jr - who I found a bit cringy and sufferable to watch from time to time - everyone seems to know what they're doing - shoutout to Tony Goldwyn, Adria Ajorna and John C. McGinley who for me, where the best of the bunch. Another big positive for me was the soundtrack. I've grown quite fond of Tyler Bates since watching John Wick 2 and he excels once more at creating tension and urgency. With all of that said, \"The Belko Experiment\" was a bit of a let down - the major plot point was left incompletely unexplained and the sequel? teaser at the end didn't make it for me. They should've been more smart and inventive, otherwise we are only left with an hour and an half of gore just for gore's sake.",
         "I think the creators of this film should be punished. They should be answer for films like this one. Unfortunately, there are hundreds of them. Where human kindness disappeared? Which message you send to the audience? You are terrorists of the human race !!! I wish there was a law against such films. I'm so sad :(",
         "First I wouldn't write any spoilers, because this movie is like rotten meat - spoiled right away. Just a garbage, go nowhere, do nothing movie. Did James Gunn get high while watching the far, far superior Battle Royale? Did his success with Guardians of the Galaxy (two isn't better than one) go to his head? Whatever happened resulted in this stupid, senseless, poorly executed watered down version of Battle Royale. There are so many plot holes in this wretched film as to make it nearly unwatchable. It's barely above the level of the SyFy channels lame Asylum movies. And those are totally terrible. Most of the actors seems to be sleep walking through the movie and those that try shouldn't have wasted their time. This is just another movie that shows why Hollywood has no balls - even when they rip off a better movie, they do it poorly. I wish I could sue the studio so I could get back the time of my life I wasted watching this GARBAGE.",
         "The Belko Experiment is a bloody mess fun that goes for so long until it wears down with the body count. Produced and written by James Gunn, the same guy that can write a fun horror thriller like Dawn of the Dead or Slither (a little grossed out film). The script is able to flash out the characters by giving them characteristics on who they are in the movie and how they will all turn out when everything hits the fan of chaos. The plot follows Mike (John Gallagher Jr.) a regular employee going to work at a Belko company in Colombia. It's a nonprofit government organization that requires employees to get tracking devices implanted in the back of their heads for insurance policies if they were ever to get kidnapped in Colombia. Every one checks in the office like Mike's girlfriend Leandra (Adria Arjona), a new employee Dany (Melonie Diaz), A techie Keith (Josh Brener), a Maintenance guy Bud (Michael Rooker), a perverted office employee Wendell (John C. McGinley), and their boss Barry (Tony Goldwyn). Every thing changes, when the shutter doors close down the building and an announcement from a strange voice demands they kill a certain amount of employees or else the devices in their heads will kill many more in the building. What worked with the film is it was quite entertaining especially for the horror thriller genre enthusiast. The concept idea was kind of mysterious as some unknown watcher is playing some sick experiment seeing how people would react in stressful situations. Even playing the idea of human nature will do whatever it takes to survive, even if it requires them to kill a coworker, their friend, etc. Who is this mysterious watcher? And what is the purpose of this sick social experiment? When things hit the fan and every one starts to break into group with the boss taking charge and becoming the decision maker on who lives and who dies does create that fear. The movie does have a lot of brutal violence, even a sequence when they put a group of people in a side that have no children, and are expendable on that wall for them to be shot at. A bit of an overkill and a very dark direction. Once you can point out the bad group of people and a good-sided people that are fighting back and hoping to survive the terror of this experiment can be thrilling. What I felt like it did not work with the film, as it can be thrilling to see how people would react or become violent to others and the final half hour of the movie with a lot of body counts. It can wear down to being just another shallow horror thriller, which does not make the film worth rewatching. Also, the plot does build up this mysterious voice that is demanding people to do the unthinkable. I was hoping to expect a bigger answer to this experiment. Sure, the ending can go to a bigger picture, as in something more is behind this. (without giving away spoilers). A story pitting people against each other and fighting to the death, sure does sound like we seen that before in The Hunger Games or Saw. Overall, The Belko Experiment is a fair thriller film that builds up the suspense and its violent sequences of seeing people kill each other. The plot does not build anything new, and the action can be repetitive. I would rate the film 3.5 out of 5.",
         "this movie does not deserve wasting your time watching it. such movies should not be considered as entertainment, it should be considered criminal or terrorism. I really don't know what is the purpose of this movie ?! around 1:40 hours of blood and killing with a very damn silly story !!!! .. I rated this movies 1/10 and if I could give it zero I would. take my advice and don't waste your time.",
         "This movie didn't do anything right. It starts out with pointless boring introductions of characters by showing them talk about random things; a good movie would have jumped right into the opening conflict. The protagonist is one of the worst characters in the movie, and therefore the viewer has no vested interest to see him survive. The villain and his methods are completely unbelievable, and the existence of said villain is just to try and add some drama to the movie, but it actually makes it worse than if the movie tried to be realistic in dealing with the situation. There's nothing new, interesting, or creative about the movie, because of the forced chaos by the writers. The movie would have been ten times more interesting, if the characters were rational, it had a slower pace, and the movie had focused on the choices people make to determine the best ethics for who should live or die. They almost had a moment like that, but then ruined it by having the villain start to randomly choose people for no reason. The ending was absurd, because apparently trained, armed guards are not capable of drawing a weapon on someone who tries to lunge free of those restraining them."
