         "With audio drop outs, shaky camera work, poor direction and a lead actress constantly out of breath and whose dancing was fair at best, this was difficult to watch. The frequency and length of commercial breaks was annoying. The stand out was Derek Hough. We all know he is a great dancer but the guy can sing too! During the bows at the end of the show, the director cut away just as Kristen Chenowith was about to come into camera view for her bow. Yikes! As a huge draw for the show, this goof was an insult to her and an example of the poor directing. NBC can't seem to pull off these live shows without some glaring mistakes.",
         "Hairspray Live deserves a great rating! While it is true there were a handful of technical bugs and when it comes to some casting choices, people who are familiar with the show might have to get used to the new cast, all the hard work and endless practice that went into this is quite an amazing feat! Being a person of theater, film and broadcast myself, what it takes to pull something off like this in a live setting blows my mind. Life is not perfect, but what makes a live show feel more realistic, more connected on a human level than a couple of bugs or passionately exhausted vocal inflections?! While some of the past live shows have had their struggles, Hairspray Live is a big leap in the right direction. For what it is, all the technical aspects they achieved, and how it was not pre-recorded, it is worth the watch.",
         "This was very disappointing. I like singing where beautiful sounds come out, not screeching. Way too much screeching. There were so many places where the music overpowered the singing so that I only saw moving lips and heard no singing at all. There is no way to adjust ears so that one can tune into the music and the other to the voice, so it's just disappointing when someone doesn't do his/her job to make sure things are working together. I had to actually force myself to watch all the way through to the end. It was way too long and not interesting enough to enjoy to the end. Maybe NBC just can't pull off a live musical show.",
         "7/10 is a pretty generous rating for Hairspray Live. There were definitely some mistakes, however it was mostly enjoyable. Good casting choices: Maddie Baillio, Harvey Fierstein, Jennifer Hudson, Kristin Chenoweth, Ephraim Sykes, Derek Hough, Andrea Martin, Martin Short, and Shahadi Wright Joseph While Baillio's vocals are outstanding, her dancing and acting are mediocre. Fierstein is unbeatable. Hudson overdoes \"I Know Where I've Been\" a tad (the rewrites in the song are unnecessary) however her vocals are incredible. Chenoweth has some issues with overdoing things too, but she's legendary. Sykes is wonderful as is Joseph. Short and Martin are both hilarious. Hough's vocals keep up with his dancing. Bad casting choices: Ariana Grande, Dove Cameron, and Garrett Clayton Grande is simply horrible in the role of Penny. She is an awful actress and her vocals are weak. If she's going to keep singing, she should stick to her pop music and move away from musical theatre. Cameron overdoes Amber. While Amber is supposed to be irritating, Cameron made her unbearable in a bad way. Her voice is much too nasal and it makes one want to mute the TV whenever she speaks. Her vocals aren't very good either. She should stick to Disney. Although Clayton has the Link Larkin look, he wasn't the best choice for this role. I think NBC tried too hard to cast actors a younger audience would be familiar with rather than trying to please the older audience, who are more likely to watch this anyway. The camera angles and sound were poorly done. It almost seemed like there had been little to no rehearsal for the cameramen. If you're looking for a musical and you're not too particular, this is perfect for you. If you're an \"expert\" in theatre and prefer a more professional production, go see this show onstage or find a better way to spend your time.",
         "It's nearing 30 years since the release of the original John Walters comedy classic that rocked my world and had me doing the Madison in 1988. The Broadway musical, coming at the time when the medium was arising from a self-induced coma, was even more thrilling with new songs and dances, starting a lengthy run that only came to an end due to the recession of 2008. Having seen Harvey in the early months of the run in the fall of 2002, and one of his many replacements, I was looking forward to the movie version in 2007. Unfortunately, as entertaining as it was with a few thrilling performances, much of the magic was gone. But the magicians have pulled the rabbit out of the hat, and the rabbit is thumping with 40 karats! An extraordinarily group of young talents join an incredible ensemble of veterans who are having a ball bringing this Tony Award winning musical fully back to life. Maddi Baillo has the energy, sweetness and no nonsense attributes to be Tracy Turnblad, the 60's teen with a little extra girth who longs to dance on TV and puts the smug snobby racists in their place, in the process bringing her sheltered mom (Harvey Fierstein, deliciously repeating his Tony winning role) out of her ironed in shell and striving for the love of the non- judgmental hunk (Garrett Clayton). But the nasty program manager (Kristen Chenoweth) and her dumb but equally hateful daughter (Dove Cameron) put their worst feet forward to stop Tracy from getting the guy and integrating the show. Among the veterans who provide hysterical supporting performances are Andrea Martin as the uptight, bigoted mother of Tracy's outcast best pal (Ariana Grande), Martin Short as Tracy's easy going pop, Rosie O'Donnell as a nasty teacher, and Sewn Hayes as Hefty Hideaway proprietor Mr. Pinky. Cleverly inserted into the dance numbers are a few former movie and stage Tracy's, looking very much like the character to provide a nice tie-in. Grande gets to break out when she hooks up with the direct but honorable young black teen (Ephraim Sykes) whose mother is the outrageous Motor Mouthed Maybelle (Jennifer Hudson) who brings the young generation of different cultures together and gets to reveal the show's moral with my personal favorite song, \"I Know Where I've Been\", ironically one of the only real standout moments in the 2007 film. However, she is more glam, and lacks the commanding presence that made the character stand out in the previous incarnations. Energetic singing and dancing, an adult edge and some great suggestive representational sets give this a live stage performance feeling. Like the feeling I get when listening to the cast album, certain moments gave me chills. In the switch from the action to commercials, keeping actors in character as they do product pushing. My only analysis about the hosting is the preview of what is coming up as really unnecessary. The show and the cast were selling themselves, and that element took away spontaneity and showed unjustified insecurity. A few moments provide questionable choices, but most of the buttons have been fastened, giving a happy end to this chapter in a revolutionary story.",
         "Awful audio, cheesy product placement, constant cutting to \"The audience\", camera crew seemed drunk. Dov Cameron was pretty awful. So much talent show so little of it. Kristin Chenowith, who I was really looking forward to, seemed weak in the Baltimore Crabs number. And sadly I don't think it was because of her performance as much as the audio/camera issues. Ariana Grande played her character quietly, as would be expected of Penny, however she was too quiet for a live show. It felt like they hadn't done a run through together and there were no sound checks. Best thing to do is skip watching the entire thing and just look for clips of Jennifer Hudson's performance. NBC enough already. None of your live shows were worth the money you spent on them",
         "Pros: Maddie Baillio, Jennifer Hudson, Ephraim Sykes, and Shahadi Wright played their characters very well, and did a wonderful job. Great singers too! Ariana Grande did not once try to upstage Baillio, nor did the producers put put more focus on her than Baillio. Cons: The camera angles were abysmal. General lack of heart and soul than other recreations. The choreographer must have been drunk for the first few numbers. Movements were very stiff. Was the sound mixer asleep? Technical issues with microphones, mainly them cutting out. The sponsor ads in between, while creative and cute, felt very out of place. Other characters did not act or sing with as much feeling.",
         "Excellent. I am giving it a ten. I wasn't sure I would like it, but I was surprised. There were big names, especially with Fierstein and Short. I have watched all of the NBC Live musicals each holiday season, and have liked them all. I liked the shoes. The red high heels on the three African American women dancers were my favorite. Second place, and also spectacular, were Tracy's bright blingy turquoise blue dancing heels. Everyone did great dancing. I always like dancing in musicals, and you know that by reading my other reviews. The Baltimore dance show reminded me of American Bandstand, hosted by Dick Clark, which originated from Philadelphia during that time period. On Bandstand, in real life, were certain named teens, couples and good dancers who became popular with a lot of audience members around the country. Our up and coming Elvis was great. Link was the heartthrob for whom Tracy yearned, and of course (spoiler) she later got her man. The weight issues were sensitive, and the racial issues were a little painful at first but then later got more comfortable. Tracy's idea of racial mingling on the dance floor was spot on. Miss Motormouth was wonderful. She had plenty of good advice for the children. She could belt out some powerful tunes. The giant hairspray can was ingenious, to say the least. The colors of the clothing and sets were just divine. Kudos to all of the cast, crew, sets, costumers, hairdressers, makeup artists, writers, directors, producers, sponsors, NBC, et al. You all have done a very wonderful job.' Ten out of ten, in my book.",
         "The 2007 'Hairspray' for me was an irresistible delight, from personal opinion one of the better film musicals in recent years and the most fun personally had from any film in a while. Everything about it just clicked. While perhaps the second best of the live productions of musicals trend in the past few years or so, 'Hairspray' was uneven and somewhat disappointing. Watchable, but not a patch on the 2007 film, it just didn't give me the same amount of joy watching the film. As far as the live musical productions go, 'The Wiz Live' for me fared best, though that wasn't perfect either, but 'Hairspray Live' is marginally better than 'Grease Live' and much better than 'The Sound of Music Live' and especially 'Peter Pan Live'. Not without its good qualities. Some of the cast do work very well. Harvey Fierstein is surprisingly good and has many delightful moments, take or leave him usually but he works well here. Kristin Chenoweth is highly deserving of her legendary status, she is an amazing vocalist who still sounds great and she is more than comfortable in her acting. Martin Short and Andrea Martin are often hilarious, while Jennifer Hudson sounds amazing as ever. Derek Hough proves himself to be just as good a singer as he is a dancer. Sets and costumes are suitably colourful. The songs are still great, with a great mix of infectiously fun, toe-tapping and heartfelt. Some of the choreography is suitably spirited. For all those good things, there are major deficits with 'Hairspray Live'. Not all the cast work with others faring very weakly. Ariana Grande sounds underpowered and while she fares very well in pop music she is completely wrong for musicals, she also has major limitations as an actress. Maddie Baillio is pretty stiff, while at other times overdoing it and struggles especially with the dancing, parts of her singing shows signs of serious strain which is painful to listen to. Dove Cameron is incredibly irritating and on the other side of the spectrum Garrett Clayton is dull. While Hudson sounds amazing, there are occasions where she overdoes it. Direction is sloppy and there are technical problems galore. Particularly in the sound, which lacks resonance and drifts in and out, and the embarrassingly amateurish camera work that looks bad and doesn't at times focus on the right people or what's going on onstage. Overall, not bad but vastly inferior to the film and quite uneven. 5/10 Bethany Cox",
         "You can understand why the television producers mounted a live version of Grease. It is an evergreen stage musical, a hit movie and has fans both young and old. Hairspray Live is more of a risky venture. I remember when the original (non musical) John Water's movie was released which acquired a cult following and was later turned into a stage musical. This live television special set in the segregated Baltimore of the 1960s where chubby teenager Tracy Turnblad dreams of dancing on The Corny Collins Show and promoting the cause of racial integration. However this production has less catchy songs, some of the songs just drone on for too long, the dancing is not that great. I found some of the singing a bit off as well, Harvey Fierstein who adapted the film as a stage musical sounds awful with his gravelly voice. The production also had issues with the staging and camera angles. In the finale people were almost constantly trying to avoid bumping each other, one actress was cut off when about to bow to the audience. An unmemorable musical.",
         "NBC and Fox seem to be leading the way with broadcasting live musical events and the results can be hit or miss. For every success like The Wiz, there is a misfire like The Sound of Music (is there any way to remove the horrid miscasting of Carrie Underwood in that debacle from our collective memories?). Shortly prior to the broadcast of Hairspray Live!, Fox completely stumbled with a dunderheaded effort of The Rocky Horror Show. Mercifully, Hairspray barely edges out The Wiz as a prime example of when things come together nicely. By now most people know the story of the hit stage play and film focusing on chubby 1960s Baltimore-based teen Tracy Turnblad, whose dream of dancing on The Corny Collins Show, winning the heart of hottie Link Larkin, and championing the cause of integration for African-Americans, while taking on white Barbie nemesis Amber von Tussel and her monstrous mama Velma, producer of the very show that Tracy hopes to conquer. The story is fun, the music by and large is bright and lively, and the production numbers veer between both personal and lavish. NBC does a creditable job of mounting a mammoth and rousing production. Although I am uncertain why they chose to omit the very funny production number The Big Dollhouse. If there are any stumbles it comes in some quibbles in the casting. Maddie Baillio is an energetic Tracy and holds the center of the show together, but she is probably the least impressive singer/dancer of the Tracys that I have. Baillio's singing seems to take on a breathy air when notes become too strenuous for her - which is a bit too often. She does a lot of vocal straining here. Ditto, her dancing is mediocre at best, so when everyone in the cast keeps harping on what a great dancer she is, they come off a tad delusional. Stage legend Harvey Fierstein returns to play Tracy's mom Edna, a rotund introvert forced out of the house by Tracy's popularity. I missed Fierstein on stage, but seeing him here I actually prefer John Travolta's more vulnerable take on the role in the film. Fierstein is amusing, but he cannot sing...at all. The majority of the lyrics to the songs are garbled by his trademark gravelly voice (let's be honest, Carol Channing has a gravelly voice, but she knows how to use it for effect and does not garble lyrics!) to the point where one feels like they are straining to make heads or tails of what he is saying. By contrast, Martin Short is a delight as the eternally upbeat Wilbur Turnblad. Of the supporting cast, Garrett Clayton is a bit too bland and Ken Doll-ish as Link. Derek Hough is surprisingly strong as Corny Collins. Both Kristin Chenoweth and Dove Cameron hit all the right notes, both acting and singing-wise as the villainous Von Tussels. Cameos by performers as Rosie O'Donnell, Sean Hayes, and Ricki Lake actually seem pretty pointless. The film's biggest misfire in my mind is the miscasting of Jennifer Hudson in the pivotal role of Motormouth Maybelle. Hudson sings well, but she is not much of an actress (fluke Oscar win included). One could best describe her efforts here as pleasant, but nothing disguises that she is all wrong for this part. Motormouth Maybelle is written as (and previously been played as) an older woman with weight issues. Watching the youthful and skinny Hudson sashay into the room, one is puzzled when she sings a song to Edna about how she has accepted her own \"extra large largesse,\" because Hudson does not currently share any of these elements. One could get away with casting Queen Latifah in the part. One could even imagine the thrill of seeing an Aretha Franklin or Patti LaBelle play the role. But Hudson is completely wrong. Still, for these quibbles, at the end of the day, this production largely succeeds because it is such a blast of good spirits and its message of fighting for a good cause and racial harmony seems more timely than ever in the Era of Trump Supporters.",
         "Hairspray Live is the television event of the season for many reasons including the upbeat and quirky soundtrack,the costumes,the choreography and the sensational cast including Maddie Baillio who shined as Tracy,Dove Cameron as Amber Von Tussle who we all hate but love Dove for playing her,Ariana Grande as Penny Pigleton (the perfect role for her) sang beautifully to go along with those amazing acting skills.Hairspray is so worth a watch and the story fits in so well with the problems of the 21st century. You'll finish watching feeling great. You can see how hard the cast and crew worked to make it come to life and make it memorable nag it sure will be.",
         "I think this was hard to do considering the other amazing movie version with Christopher Walken and John Travolta. On the other hand, Harvey Firestein is so cute as the mom, he kind of steals the show. I have no idea how he has such cleavage, but it is quite impressive. And Martin Short is adorable but just not Walken, you know. Jennifer Hudson is A-Freaking-mazing, of course. And Ariana Grande, well I had never heard her sing before today(because I'm apparently not that cool) but she did a great job.Costumes were pretty nice, and Rosie O'Donnell is actually bearable. I thought it was worth the watch. Yes there were some technical issues, however its live and therefore forgivable. Hardcore fans probably will notice the technical precision in which the dancers do their thing, the change in costumes on many of the originals etc. But the new costumes are really well done and, while different, are just as well done as the original. I had very few dislikes. Harvey was a little stiff, but he is not a young man. Ariana at the end was wearing heels that were way too high for the period, and it made her look a little kinky. Still love the shout out to Essex Community College. I graduated from Baltimore City Community College myself. Yeah! MobTown!!",
         "NBC has produced some good live musicals and \"Hairspray Live!\" shows that they have learned from their past productions. Endless hours of work are evident. The logistics alone are mind boggling with a cast of this size and so many scenes. A flotilla of cameras (they say they used 58) captures the action from so many angles. Because of so many common plot elements, the show welcomes comparisons with \"Grease\". The TV dance show. The teenage leads. The gym dance. But I found myself enjoying this show and wondering at its quality. I would have sworn Maddie Baillio's (Tracy Turnblad) voice was prerecorded, it sounded so clear. I thought the show deserved an Emmy for sound. But as it progressed, I noticed technical errors. And eventually, it drew on too long. I realize it is difficult to cut scenes or musical numbers that are worthy of being seen/heard, but the show would improve by losing at least a half hour. The plot began to slow and to wander. And it became too preachy. Otherwise, the show is quite good. Dove Cameron (Amber) has a great voice. Ariana Grande (Penny) appears to have fun throughout. Kristen Chenoweth (Velma) is her usual, dynamic self. Harvey Fierstein is, of course, iconic in his portrayal of Edna. Derek Hough, who has plenty of live experience, is solid as Corny--a role that holds some scenes together. Maddie Baillio, in her first credited professional role, may not have the magnetism of some others who have played the central role, but her energy does not lag despite the demanding role (and its dancing) and her voice seems to gain strength as the show progresses. Martin Short is terrific as Edna's husband, Wilbur. And Jennifer Hudson sings the heck out of her songs. The other cast members are, likewise, strong in their performances. The set(s) also deserves mentioning. It is versatile and it captures the feeling of 1960s Baltimore. Early on, I thought the show is very rewatchable, but its final length dampened my enthusiasm for re-viewing. Addendum 12/8/16: Testing my theory, I rewatched the show, though I did fast forward through a section--something I would only do after watching the entire show. I enjoyed it again. The First 1:35 is electric. Though I would miss the performances that would be removed, if they cut from that point (in Motormouth Records right after Inez says, \"We'll set off sparks like Rosa Parks!\") straight to the Corny Collins Show at 2:29, it would be a tighter production. Of course, they would have to shore up a few plot points. The entire cast is magnificent. Some other special mentions: Shahadi Wright as Little Inez. Garrett Clayton as Link. Ephraim Sykes as Seaweed. I grievously forgot to mention the Corny Collins Dancers. Tremendous! Lastly, I want to mention the brief scene that takes place in the alley just before they are at Motormouth Records. Although the music anachronistically invokes Isaac Hayes' \"Theme From Shaft\" (1971), it provides the flavor and feeling of an era for a solid dance number.",
         "I saw the John Travolta movie some years ago, but don't remember a whole lot about it. However, NBC got it right again this year. I don't recall any weaknesses other than the sound being poor in a few cases, and I wasn't able to hear dialogue. Apparently having an unknown as the lead is the best idea. it worked last year, and Maddie Baillio did a great job. she can sing and dance and has a nice personality. Harvey Fierstein makes an ideal drag queen. That voice! Martin Short is surprisingly good as Tracy's father. He is basically the same character Martin Short always plays, but he just stands out so much more than I expected. While I am kind of a square, most of this music isn't too bad compared to what passes for music in 2016. And there were even songs for someone with my particular taste. Jennifer Hudson does a great job. her style of singing isn't really my taste, but that's not important. She steals the show when she sings. People will like her. Ariana Grande is so adorable as the shy best friend, but she really shows her singing and dancing talent later, and she looks good in a short skirt. What a hypocrite Kristin Chenoweth is! All this emphasis on high moral standards but she shows off her chest. Great job, and she even hits those really high notes. Dove Cameron does a nice job as the spoiled daughter who thinks she will be Miss Hairspray because of all the strings being pulled. Ephraim Sykes is quite appealing as Seaweed, the teen who is tired of being a second-class citizen and teaches Tracy the moves she needs to make it, and he really stands out. I'm sure I left someone out, but I can't think of anyone who didn't do a good job. I was surprised by the amount of time devoted to the quest for integration, but it's an important message here. NBC needs to keep doing these musicals.",
         "It was obvious that this live TV production of a stage musical that was itself based on a movie wasn't going to live up to the original movie. Even so, it was a good time. A newcomer plays Tracy Turnblad, the teenager whose quest to appear on a dance show becomes a quest for racial integration in 1962 Baltimore. My favorite performances came from Harvey Fierstein as Edna (the role played by Divine in John Waters's movie) and Kristin Chenoweth as Velma (the role played by Debbie Harry in John Waters's movie). Andrea Martin was also to die for as Prudy Pingelton, who freaks out at the sight of African-Americans (especially when her daughter falls in love with an African-American teenager). I should probably admit that I've never seen the stage production, or the 2007 movie based thereupon. Nevertheless, \"Hairspray Live!\" was an OK way to spend three hours. Jennifer Hudson's performance as Motormouth Maybelle is a force to be reckoned with (take THAT, American Idol!). So, it wasn't anything great - the interludes showing the audience were distracting - but still a fun way to spend a brief amount of time.",
         "There are some flaws, but the entertainment value and the theme of promoting integration among the races in the 1960s done to teen music makes this a memorable show. Jennifer Hudson is a standout and belts out those songs with strong conviction and a voice as lovely as ever as a bell. The flaws include the line by gym teacher Rosie O'Donnell that you're entitled to a substandard education and that special education is really looked down upon and made out to be for the rejects of society. The line that is sung to Tracy about loving her despite her weight still shows our bias view towards the heavy and reminded me when Groucho Marx said to Margaret Dumont, a wealthy dowager in one of his films, who was worth $8 million: \"I'd love you even if you were worth 4 million!\" There is also words about budget cuts and gas chambers which lessens their impact upon history. The biggest flaw is Harvey Fierstein. His gravel voice was a little too much to take and it's time for him to end being Edna Turnblad, the Baltimore \"yenta\" who comes out of her shell thanks to her daughter's drive to enter a television teen show and promote integration among the dancers. In summary **** for diversity, but about half that given the problems I enumerated.",
         "This campy musical which takes place in the fifties in Baltimore in the middle of racial divide is a lot of fun. Of course, it's outrageous and silly in a lot of places, and granted the sound was a problem, but I really like that they are trying to get the fresh element of live television back a bit. The leads were good. I especially liked Derek Hough as Corny. He comes across as quite the showman. Who would have thought he could sing so well. There is a really positive message in all of this as the main character innocently puts a bomb in the works. She is delightful although I thought her dancing was a little weak. Harvey Fierstein is at his best as the mother of the young woman. And I could watch Martin Short all day long. A nice bit of commentary on a city that hasn't learned a lot in all these years."
