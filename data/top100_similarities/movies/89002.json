But in reality, trying to mother Rebecca (Rowan Blanchard) and Cecil (Mason Cook), who clearly dont want her around, is her toughest challenge yet. Also, her husband, Wilbur (Joel McHale), wouldnt know a spy if he lived with one, which is exactly the case - Marissa's a retired secret agent. Marissa's world is turned upside down when the maniacal Timekeeper (Jeremy Piven) threatens to take over the planet and she's called back into action by the head of OSS, home of the greatest spies and where the now-defunct Spy Kids division was created. With Armageddon quickly approaching, Rebecca and Cecil are thrust into action when they learn their boring stepmom was once a top agent... now the worlds most competitive ten year olds are forced to put their bickering aside and rely on their wits. With a little help from a couple of very familiar Spy Kids, Carmen (Alexa Vega) and Juni Cortez (Daryl Sabara), and some mind-blowing gadgets, they just may be able to save the world and possibly bring their family together while they're at it.",

         "Hopes were not high coming into Spy Kids: All the Time in the World. It is the fourth film in a franchise suffering from diminishing returns, plus it was using the stupid idea of smell-o-vision. And this family film does not disappoint. Marissa Wilson (Jessica Alba) is a top OSS spy who retires after capturing a super villain, Tik Tok, and starts a family with her husband Wilbur (Joel McHale) and stepchildren Rebecca (Rowan Blanchard) and Cecil (Mason Cook). A year later a new villain has emerged, the Time Keeper, who speeds up time using the Armageddon Device to punish humanity for wasting time. Marissa is called back by the OSS director, Danger D'Amo (Jeremy Piven), to recapture Tik Tok which should lead them to the Time Keeper. But the Time Keeper sets out to kidnap Rebecca and Cecil because Rebecca has the only thing that could stop the Armageddon Device. There are many problems with Spy Kids: All the Time in the World. It's a cheap and unimaginative film where you could easily predict how they would play out. We have seen these story elements so many times before: the dad is a workaholic; there is animosity between step-mum and step-daughter as the step-mum tries to get closer to the children; the revelation of a lie, and so many others. The humour is crude, mostly poo, fart and vomit gags, basically the lowest common denominator which most children will easily outgrow. The other major route of humour is the barrage of puns: time puns, dog puns and smell puns � we're not stupid! The action is rudimentary; it is easy to expect much better from Robert Rodriguez who just uses poor CGI and quick cuts. And if you can't guess who the Time Keeper really is then you haven't seen enough movies. Spy Kids: All the Time in the World feels like it is a movie that is only made for a quick buck, not for any love of the material or the need to tell a good story. A movie aimed at children should be able to enliven their imaginations: Spy Kids: All the Time in the World is not going to do that. The artificial CGI scenes just look too fake for children to accept and buy into the action and the basic predictable plot will mean that children will not love it. Adults and parents will feel nothing but suffering when watching this movie. This is just a mindless movie with no imagination, which is ironic considering it makes a point that children make better spies because they have more imagination. Children are smart; they ask questions, see plot holes and come up with ideas involving sci-fi concepts. The best family and children's movies are clever, well-plotted affairs and often have good ideas behind them. Spy Kids: All the Time in the World does not share those traits. Plus this movie carries on the awful trend of spies with babies not working. Most of the acting is sub-par. The child leads are bland and not natural actors; it's your typical weak-child acting, and they are no Chloe Mortez or Kodi Smit-McPhee. McHale was truly unconvincing as the father and again a typical bad performance in a bad family movie. Alba was a punch bag for gags to be bounded off on. Ricky Gervais seemed to be having fun, but I'm sure that's because he got a paycheck for saying bad lines in a recording studio. Piven is much the same, having fun and just being over the top. As movie fans we expect better from Rodriguez, who's done great movies like Sin City, From Dusk to Dawn and the \"Mexico\" Trilogy. Let's hope he is doing this movie so we can finally get Sin City 2. And I am sure you are asking the big question � what was the Scratch-and-Sniff card like? It was just a bunch of sickly sweet smells and simply just a gimmick. But you already knew that.",
         "I thoroughly enjoyed the first two Spy Kids films, they were fun, entertaining and ideal family films. Spy Kids 3 was rather mediocre and disappointing, but any horrible assets that film had was nothing compared to this. When I entered the theatre to watch this, yes I wanted to see it despite the trailer not looking that good, I thought if it is bad surely it can't be as bad as The Adventures of Sharkboy and LavaGirl. I was wrong, as awful as that film was Spy Kids 4 takes the cake as Rodriguez's worst film. The film for starters looks cheap. The camera work at best is odd, and the effects lack clarity. The gadgets looked cool from the outset but once the nappy bombs for instance are introduced they lose their appeal very quickly. I didn't think much of the soundtrack either. I found it rather generic here rather than jaunty and memorable. And Rodriguez's direction is his most unfocused and inept directing job in my opinion of his career. The script is awful, relying far too much on tired slapstick and heavy-handed messaging, while the story is rushed and much too thin for the film's running time and the action is dull and not helped by the haphazard editing. Acting-wise, this film is disappointing. It was nice to be Daryl Sabarra and Alexa Vega here but other than the basic concept of the movie, them and Rodriguez, there seemed to be no connection to its predecessors. The new kids do what they can, but they aren't as confident or as appealing. Jeremy Piven does give his all into a very underwritten and uninteresting villain part and his two other roles as well but at points it feels like he's overdoing it. Danny Trejo is wasted, Antonio Banderas was cut which is yet another reason why this doesn't feel like a Spy Kids movie, Jessica Alba does nothing with her role other than look pretty, while even Ricky Gervais is flat. The cast are not helped by how their characters are written. The characters here are so cardboard, it is difficult to engage with them on any level. Overall, despite the trailer I was all for seeing this film. But it was awful(as part of a franchise and on its own terms) and a big disappointment. 1/10 Bethany Cox",
         "This movie is not only the worst movie of the summer, it could possibly be the worst movie I have ever seen. I took my two boys aged 7 and 4 to watch this sorry excuse for a movie. The boys actually were fairly entertained, but I must say they are not exactly seasoned veterans of the movie watching experience. We saw it in 2D but also had the '4th D' experience. This amounted to a card they gave you that you scratch and sniff at certain points during the movie. It is a horrible gimmick that does not even work. I scratched as hard as I could and could only smell a faint flowery smell. That is only one minor flaw of the movie. The other flaws are as follow. The acting is horrendous. How they continue to let Jessica Alba act and even STAR in a movie is a decision that some Hollywood exec will eventually pay for with their job. Her lack of acting abilities were only surpassed by the rest of the cast. But it was not entirely their fault as the film's basic plot and script was about as thin as Kate Moss on a hunger strike. So what do you combine with horrible acting, a thin plot and countless moronic lines written by the worst screen writers they could dig up? Mindless violence that is not suitable for small children. This movie is supposed to be about spy kids I presumed, based on the title. Most of the scenes and actions were played out by adults and the plethora of punching and kicking scenes was immature and detrimental to young, easily influenced minds. This movie is disturbing for young children and is completely inappropriate for children of all ages. It also is so horribly acted and the screenplay so ill-conceived that adults are left wondering how in the world Hollywood can continue to put out such dribble and expect us to shell out our hard earned dollars on such mindless 'entertainment.' To sum it all up, avoid this movie at all costs. Even if your children have seen the other versions and beg you to see it be strong and suggest alternatives. Show Hollywood that you will not be swayed by their slick advertising and inept film-making.",
         "I have often said that in order to enjoy mindless movies like \"Transformers\", we should \"leave our brains at the door of the cineplex\". Well, in order to enjoy this \"Spy Kids\" sequel, we need to lower our IQ to the level of four-year olds! 'Mindlessness' doesn't quite cut it, it is juvenile indulgence, meaning, it is only for kids below five. And if you have been following the cinema ads and promos, you would know that this movie comes in 4D - with the added dimension of 'smell'. For that, viewers are given a numbered card (called Aroma-Scope) so that they can scratch-and-smell when the number appears on the screen. This is a childish gimmick aimed at kids. For adults, it is more of a nuisance because the scents are faint and the exercise distracts us from the action on the screen. Although there are many fart and poop scenes, the Aroma-Scope only provides scents of chewing gum and other edible stuff (thank goodness for that). History has demonstrated that all smell-o-vision gimmicks mostly stink. Marissa Cortez Wilson (Jessica Alba) is such a dedicated spy that even when she is nine months pregnant, she manages to take down notorious villain Tick Tock (Jeremy Piven) before going into labor and retiring from her spy duties. Her aim is to devote all her time to her newborn and her step-kids, Rebecca (Rowan Blanchard) and Cecil (Mason Cook) and hubby Wilbur (Joey McHale). Soon, however, she may not have that much time. One year later, Tick Tock and accomplice, The Timekeeper (also Piven), are back at their attempt to rob the world of 'time' - and Rebecca, Cecil and their 'guard dog' Argonaut (voice of Ricky Gervais) must save the world (what else?). Also, they team up with Marissa's niece and nephew, Carmen and Juni Cortez (Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara reprising their former Spy Kids roles) to make this mission a family reunion of sorts. Writer-director Robert Rodriguez seems to be milking the same old cinema-script cow, urging parents to spend more time with their kids. This 'message' has been used by almost all family movies throughout the decade. The time-theft and time-travel conceits can be puzzling to children even if they allow Rodriguez to make use of all sorts of time-related gags. Of course, Rodriguez cannot resist the poop and fart gags, as well as throwing food all over the place. These, I understand, are the laugh-out-loud staple for American kids below five. Among the cast, Blanchard and Cook are suitably cute and effective as the new title characters. Bringing back former Spy Kids, Vega and Sabara, is a good idea, adding a nostalgic touch for parents in the audience. Ditto that for Danny Trejo's short cameo as Uncle Machete. However, the irony of Daddy Wilbur being a 'Spycatcher' on TV is lost on the kids and scores no points with the adults. As for Jessica Alba (as Marissa, the younger sister to Antonio Bandera's character), she provides the main box-office lure, nothing more. Strictly kids' stuff. (limchangmoh.blogspot.com)",
         "I don't think this was a bad film, granted it wasn't a good film but for me I couldn't help relate it back to the original movies and in that sense I think it did well, it didn't stray too far from the original plot lines and I liked that because I was afraid after all these years it would have changed completely. So many of these reviews rate it as \"cheep and crappy\", well it's definitely cheap, the graphics are pretty much exactly the same as the original films and its not going to win any awards for being a brilliant flick but the movie wasn't made for YOU, it was made for the kids. I think as a kids movie, or family movie, it does well and I believe the children will love it just as I loved the originals when I was younger. Yes the plot is cliché and predictable but to a kid it's a whole other world where they can be a hero without growing up.",
         "I love the Spy Kids movies - even Spy Kids 3, despite its flaws. When they announced that Spy Kids 4 was on the way, I had mixed feelings. Yeah, it was cool to see another Spy Kids movie on the way and as the cast was locked into place, seeing Alexa Vega and Darryl Sabarra coming back was a total blast. Then it started to get a bit worrying with news of the gimmick of smell-o-vision being used to try and sell this one. The end result? A big mess. On the plus side, the effects and the 3D in this are better than they have been in previous outings. There is some fun to be had seeing Juny and Carmen come back as grown up Spy Kids and there are some nice little links to the original trilogy. The new Spy Kids are kinda fun but not as cool or engaging as the original two and Jessica Alba is pretty game to put up with some of the crap she's put through here. And some giggles can be had from Ricky Gervais' spy dog and Jeremy Piven's multiple appearances. That said, the smell-o-vision thing is just plain distracting (granted, it's not overdone and is largely confined to the starting 20 minutes) with the large numbers flashing on screen and beeping to make sure you actually do scratch and sniff. The comedy is far too heavy handed and relies more on poop and fart jokes than in previous outings and is aimed strictly at the lowest common denominator - talk about dumbing down! And the message is hammered home with all the finesse and subtlety of sledgehammer to the crotch. There are numerous times where the whole \"spend time with your kids/parents\" is said direct to camera and after about the third or fourth time, it gets preachy. It's a shame that Robert Rodriguez felt the need to restart the series with such a lame and heavy handed mess, given just how much fun the first three had to offer. And, on a personal note, I was gutted to see that Uncle Machete was relegated to a blink and you miss him cameo after being built up so well. Aah well, I'm guessing there are plans for another couple movies so there's a chance that it can redeem itself but I think that after this, it's gonna have to work hard!",
         "...Took the family (5 year old son, 2.5 year old daughter) to see Sky Kids 4 today.. Speaking as an adult who saw all 3 of the original SPY KIDS movies in the theatre, this is easily the worst of the series. Joel Mchale (who i have actually become a fan of based off his THE SOUP and COMMUNITY work), Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara give some incredibly bad performances. Embarrassingly-so. Jessica Alba does what Jessica Alba does (thank the Gods she's cute and met Robert Rodriguez), and Jeremy Piven....actually i liked Piven. His character had an interesting story- arc, and he gives a solid performance. Some of Ricky Gervais' one-liners were funny, too. The rest of the film was pretty unbearable. However, speaking as a parent who was out hoping to show his kids a good time, i actually have to give this movie a solid rating. My 2 kids enjoyed the heck out of it, from the talking dog to the baby decking a bad guy, the kids loved it. And my son had a lot of fun keeping track of when to engage the AROMASCOPE scratch card. A nice film for younger families, i think.",
         "The real purpose of a movie is to entertain (escapism) - to distance you from your problems for a short period of time. If you will look at this movie from the perspective of a person viewing movies for entertainment purposes, then this movie is good (not very good since there are a lot of better escapist movies out there). If you look at it from the perspective of a movie critic, then this is a horrible movie, filled with clichés and poop jokes. The first film of this franchise may have had some cliché plot points, but it didn't rely on poop and fart jokes to move the story or try to make the viewer laugh. This movie has the usual 'stepdaughter-hates-stepmom' and the 'geeky brother' story lines along with the happily ever after ending. It seems the movie thinks that watching these story lines is entertaining to kids, when in fact, it's not (speaking from my perspective as a 13 year old kid). To be frank, it's quite annoying. However, this movie doesn't lack on the entertainment value. CGI all-around, gadgets everywhere, this movie has tons of cool stuff to keep the viewer at the edge of their seat. There are jokes that if you watch first may seem funny, but in the end will make you think \"is that joke really funny, or is it offensive\". Bottomline is, this movie can be good or bad, depending on your perspective. To me, it's escapism at its finest.",
         "I'm so glad I loved this movie. It's not normal that so many people find it so bad. So much resentment, such poor capacity of wonder... I hope you people do find the time to spend with your loved ones. Loved the message, loved the way it all flowed. I had a great time. A great experience to share with wife and kid. The acting is actually nice. The special fx are just enough. Not eccentric, not about visual wonder, but rather just perfectly adapted to convey purpose and meaning. The scenery is excellent. The script consistent. Predictable? So what? Is there anything more predictable than death? And that doesn't stop us from living. Nor does that stop us from enjoying life. It's not an excuse. I love this movie.",
         "I'm aware that many people like to encounter films as a small, unchallenging adventure. That isn't possible with me, but I have something similar: sometimes a simple film is a relaxed encounter with the filmmaker, a sort of illustrated visit in his home. I like Rodriguez. I like his joy in image and his independent enthusiasm. I do not ever expect him to produce something that changes my life, like fellow Austinite Malick can. But sometimes you just want to hang out. One thing that is impressive is knowing that he creates his films mostly in his own studio with greenscreen, networked to special effects subcontractors. He must have had to do things that few others do in order for his work to seamlessly integrate with his life. So, though there is nothing profound about him except his passion, visiting a film can simply relax into that passion. I am particularly hooked on the Spy Kids franchise because the first one had so many inside references to old AI tools and techniques that I assume he worked very closely with someone from that era, perhaps even someone I know. Perhaps it was a side effect from setting up his personal production infrastructure. But it also because I know he is coming at this as a dad who enjoys his kids and basically wants to share at a cinematic level. That is why, for instance that I tolerate the over top 'dad message' about the importance of spending time with your kids now rather than be absent in a studio. (Yes, that is the basic plot.) The first film was themed on AI as mentioned. The second on genetics, and the third on a Tron-like game. This one plays � in the most superficial way � with speculations on parallel universes and time joins. Others will inform about the amazingly bad acting by both pairs of siblings, the really off- beat pacing and the general heavy-handed nature of the thing. But under all that is a genuine human, being genuine and open, inviting us into the world he decorated himself (there's a joke about that). Where else but with Rose's influence will you get a superspy kicking butt first as she goes into labor and later with the baby strapped on her chest. That alone will stick with you.
