         "This movie is really great! Great directing, photography (just watch the scenes in Iceland), sets, score (get the double-cd release of the scores for both films on Cobra Records if you are fond of this score), acting (I can't take my eyes of Karin Dor as Brünhild...) and script (I love the way they changed the story to address some of the ambiguities of the material, like the reason why Siegfried and Brünhild already know each other, but still retain the feeling of the original Nibelungenlied) make this movie together with it's second part \"Kriemhilds Rache\" a masterpiece. But avoid the version that cut together the two parts \"Siegfried\" and \"Kriemhilds Rache\" to \"Das Schwert der Nibelungen\" aka \"Those who carry the seed of destruction\" (or something like that), it really doesn't show this masterpiece in all it's glory, and might give you the wrong ideas about this two movies. These are two movies just screaming for a DVD release!",
         "I remember seeing this when it was on release in the UK. I'm sure the UK version was released as \"Those Whom the Gods Wish to Destroy\" and might have been a combination of both Teil 1 and Teil 2 edited together. It must have been dubbed as it had an English soundtrack. I think the film poster had the film title carved out of a rock face a bit like the Ben Hur poster. It was some long time after seeing the film that I found out it was part of a series of traditional German Folklore tales. I can recall the scene where Siegfried kills a somewhat cardboard looking dragon and bathes in its blood. Unfortunately a leaf gets stuck to his back and the only part of him not bathed in dragon blood is where the leaf was stuck. Everywhere he was covered in blood makes him impervious to any weapon. He subsequently walks through a fire and only gets burned where the leaf was stuck, leaving him with a leaf shaped scar on his back. Later on during some subterfuge, someone (his wife I think) sews a patch onto the back of his tunic where the leaf had been stuck and the villain is then able to aim a spear at the only place where he can be wounded and killed. That happens about halfway through and its that which makes me think the UK release was edited from both films. I'd certainly like to see this again but so far I've not ever seen it available on video.",
         "Saw this film when it came out in Mexico city, around Christmass of 1967. the tittle was \"Whom the Gods Wishes to Destroy\", subtitle \"Los Nibelungos\" (Spanish for \"Die Nibelungen). If the first part was 91 minutes and the second part was 110, that makes 201 minutes. The complete version I saw was 195 minutes. I don't know how nearly 6 minutes of can damages any film, specially in the sixties when a film of tree hours or more was a norm. Also, the film opened at the Cine Manacar, one of those wonderful movie palaces of the era now long go, in a superb 70mm print, with 6 tracks stereophonic sound. and asset that i'm afraid no DVD or the best Home Theatre will cant match today. Yes the film is must for moviegoers. It's a pity not to see it the way was originally shown.",
         "I loved this movie, despite of its flaws. Because there ARE many flaws: for instance to make Brünhilde's fiery prison A VOLCANO IN ICELAND, and to cut film sequences from a documentary about a volcano eruption, and mix these with sequences with the actors staring, supposedly at the volcano, was... ORIGINAL, to say the least! :-) To have the Norwegian king Harald Hårfagre (who actually existed) present a wedding gift to the daughter of Wotan was also... a \"little\" mixed-up in time and space, maybe..? :-) Also, the technical effects are of course deficient if you are used to today's movies. The attempt to make it look as if Brünhilde is riding through the air, to mention only one instance of this, is very clumsy - almost an object for laughter if you are in a derisive mood. This movie is not for those who want a movie to heed faithfully to an original text. (Although in this case there is of course no ONE text either - the story of Siegfried and Brünhilde - or Sigurd and Brynhild as we call them in the Scandinavian countries - exists in very many shapes.) To me, however, the flaws and oddities did not matter a bit! Because this is a wonderful, beautiful movie with wonderful, beautiful actors, set in a medieval fantasy world - sometimes interspersed with pictures from the barren landscape of Iceland. There is love, adventure, heroes, and human feelings that we all can still relate to: envy, jealousy, passion, love, hate, lust for revenge... And there are so many beautiful details to look at, in clothes, jewels, horses, weaponry, castles, churches... all the strong and beautiful colours, and all the gold! This movie is rich and lavish and opens up a fantastic, magic, fantasy world for you. I recommend it strongly!"

Siegfried challenges Gunther at Easter to a duel for both realms, is however proposed instead a preferable marital alliance with Gunther's sister Kriemhild. Just after their betrothal invades Ludegast, king of the Saxons, who however swears allegiance to Burgundy when defeated but spared in duel by Siegfried. Now Gunther demands, for Kriemhild's hand, Siegfried gets him Brunhild as politically ideal bride for Burgundy. Siegfried manages this, but only by using more magic, which will later come at a terrible price..."],
