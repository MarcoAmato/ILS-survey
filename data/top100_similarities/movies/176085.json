         "Okay, so there one reviewer (who obviously has not seen the movie) bitching about the only other reviewer being from the production (sure, a guy with 2.729 reviews and 16 years on the site is in on this movie). Give me a break. I felt the need to clarify that this is not a god-awful movie. It's an indie production with a small cast and limited locations. This is a minimalistic zombie movie about a woman getting tracked by a single zombie throughout the desert as she travels towards an airport. There's a few interactions with other people, but for the most it it's her and Small Dick (Smalls for short). Most of the time there's no real tension. Just a few mellow jump scares (as is the game with zombie movies), when things go a bit awry due to thoughless actions by the protagonist. Later on, when more characters come in play, more common zombie tropes switch places with the rather unique setup this movie started out with. It's a nice way to fill up part of an evening. It's not meant for people who crave loads of action in their (zombie) movie, so don't go out and expect this. It's more of an introspective story that unfolds during a slow, permanent chase.",
         "First off, this is worth a watch, and it's far better than the 2-3 stars some reviewers are awarding. Woman takes an unplanned \"walking holiday\" in the Nevada desert and picks up an unwanted follower in the form of a slow but relentless Zombie, is a great premise. Brittany Allen as Molly does a perfectly acceptable job in the lead playing a character who has to deal with increasingly grim situations with nothing but steely determination 5 grams of cocaine to see her through. In the last act the film lost it's clarity but still just about kept it together. 6 out of ten, could have been a 7 with a tighter ending.",
         "To try and quench my zombie appetite I have watched MANY MANY...and I mean MAAANY zombie movies, and many of them are pretty dang bad. This is not one of them. Although not academy award level in any aspect, I would consider this deserving of awards in the independent and lower budget arenas! If reviewers and viewers pay attention you will notice that this movie is labeled a Drama, Horror, Thriller. I believe that's accurate. For hard core zombie fans who like strict zombie action, I can see why some would be disappointed. I was not. And in fact I was quite pleasantly captivated. This was a breath of fresh air for this tired, same ole same ole, genera. I finally found a zombie movie that had some MEANING to it. Where the main character was believable and multi dimensional. I loved the humor inter mixed thru out! The camera work was EXCELLENT. The acting and direction was very very good. And the story was full and different with the pace set at a nice steady burn. After about 45 minutes the pace does pick up with some new characters introduced and some nice surprises! After reading my review, you can tell whether or not this film may interest you. If you are on the fence...let me push you off. I thought it was an excellent film.",
         "I understand that some people will not like this at all. It is annoying, you have a main character who's morally bankrupt, annoying and does not really seem to have any redemption value. Add to that decision making of the questionable kind and you have a dangerous mix. Dangerous because the interest of the viewer may wane to put it mildly. Having said that and in stark contrast to all that, there are quite a few funny and really good moments. They may feel like skits and sometimes out of touch with the rest of the movie. And still they are able to elevate it, be it because of the humor, the tension or some sort short violence outburst. Sometimes a combination, which makes you wonder if underneath it all there was a way better movie, with a bit more time spent on the script, the characters and just in general. The main actress does her best to carry the movie (no pun intended), don't confuse despicable behavior with bad acting ... I hope this helped you decide if it is worth giving this a chance or not ...",
         "Started watching this having already decided (based on the trailer) that it was gonna be another trash zombie flick, but i was surprised and glad to have been wrong. The film was well made and dare i say well directed and the casting choice for the lead was excellent in my opinion. The pace was good and the general mood of the film also. Script-wise it was lacking a bit but the main character's development and back story were great, the dynamic between Molly and the zombie really made me empathize with both of them, especially since after a point there's a bond formed between the two. The end was actually pretty satisfying and left me rooting for Molly. The actress gave a good performance considering she's the only character with lines for almost the entirety of the film. I tried to be as objective as i could with this review since i love zombie flicks but the review below trashing the film is really misleading, if it wasn't for that review i wouldn't have actually bothered writing mine, since i have an account for the past 5 years and this is my first one. This film maybe be no Night of the living dead but it has a lot of heart and i trust it will find it's place in the genre's audience.",
         "***Spoilers sprinkled throughout*** Now I may have given this a bit higher score just to balance out some of the ppl that obv haven't even seen the whole movie, but for me I'd prb give it a true 7 outta 10.. It resonates with me on a personal level, and I'd be being a bit dishonest if I didn't reveal this bias...I don't need to share with you exactly why, but suffice to say I have ongoing experience with having almost 100% custody of a sibling's child. Moving on tho, I also watch a TON of indie horror, and immediately recognized the lead from the Vicious Bros \"Extraterrestrial,\" which not ashamed to say is another movie I thoroughly enjoyed! It has its flaws, as does this flick, tho these movies are about as far apart as can be tone-wise. This movie is pretty slow moving, but I loved that. It gave the lead time to really endear herself as a character, despite her hooker/druggie/child abandoning status.. But that was the whole point of this movie, redemption.. And it hit home well IMHO. The protagonist's talk with Smalls was great.. Not all actresses can pull off that much monologue throughout a movie and carry it well but she did. This is deff a drama first, and horror or really thriller second. There's one scene where Smalls intervenes, and tho the scene may have been obvious in set-up, it still really worked.. for me anyway.. Worth a watch if you enjoy a lil comedy in your horror and a slow paced but awesome flick.",
         "A stripper-mom fleeing a zombie apocalypse finds herself alone and stranded in the desert as one of the creatures stalks her ... Good concept with an interesting twist and energetic climax. Plenty of style, with fine cinematography and a few big-bucks effects. This is from the writer/director/producer team behind Grave Encounters, so you might expect a bleak and harrowing story, but it's surprisingly big hearted if not quite optimistic. But surprise surprise - this experienced team allow a lot of niggles to interrupt the story, with constant lapses in plausibility and logic. For example, in the opening scene the getaway car digs its rear wheel into the sand and won't budge - instantly I thought of a way to dislodge it, but the characters didn't even begin to think - even for the comedy effect. Later, there are plenty opportunities to exploit the creature's weakness, but the heroine doesn't have the wit to even try. A safe-haven house appears and disappears for no reason. The story is peppered with these problems, which kept dragging me out but are easily fixable. It undermined the humour and pathos the story was aiming for, so that's frustrating. The final act has a serious change of tack, which kinda works. It does deliver on character and emotion, but its awkwardness might have been less if the earlier story had flowed more smoothly. So there's plenty to enjoy in this movie, but the script was just a bit off. The landscapes are gorgeous, and there's a good car-shot with a face in the wing mirror, plus a fire-lit reveal of the monster creeping up from behind. Also plenty of gore and skin. Lead actress does well, with a great squeal & scarper when trying to confront the zombie. And the zombie's movements are well done, and he even generated sympathy. Was the chemistry believable? Would have helped to have better dialogue. Enjoyed the music. And the title comes from a gross-out snack. Overall: Quality, but sloppy.",
         "*Spoliers******* First of nice try, I mean really nice try. My only problem that made watching this hard work is that the zombie should R been dead contained within the first 5/10 minutes of being on screen. Any characters that fails to deal with a zombie that moves like that deserves to die. Or use as bait. Also hiding in a bath tub from something that has tracked you across a desert by the smell of your blood is not going to miss you hiding in a bathtub behind a shower curtain... Smell doesn't work that way. The intelligence of the main character is pitiful. Throw in some rape hicks for shock value and this honestly is the most stupid, shout out loud at the screen movie I have witnessed in many years. Then throw in a little romance/understanding/stuff happens moments with said zombie and that's it I'm done. I'm sorry for the spelling and grammar of this review but my mind and brain cells have been depleted by this movie. Some may like it, I could see why but I want my money back.. And I didn't pay to see it.",
         "During the zombie apocalypse, showgirl Molly (Brittany Allen) is leaving Las Vegas only to get stranded alone in the desert with one lone zombie tracking her closely. Molly examines her life, uses the zombie to vent against men, and becomes attached to the walking dead man. She utilizes rule one: Zombies can't climb. Now why she didn't use her advantage to bash the zombie's head in at that point isn't explained. I am not really into these low budget one man films, or woman in this case. Her venting and reflection attempted to give the film some significance, but hey, it's a zombie film. Brittany Allen did a good job to keep a flawed script alive. Guide: F-word. Rape. No nudity",
         "\"It Stains the Sands Red\" (2017) is a pretty decent zombie film; I'd rate it an 8 out of 10. The fun starts with a truly impressive aerial shot of Las Vegas in the midst of a full blown zombie apocalypse \u2014 it's great special effects work, and it's almost enough to compensate entirely for the limited scope of the story that follows it. (This film focuses largely on one stranded woman being pursued by one zombie antagonist through the Nevada desert.) Although much of the film might be too slow for some horror fans, it's actually surprisingly intelligent. The movie focuses on things often neglected in survival horror scenarios like this one \u2014 factors like exhaustion, the elements, firearms proficiency, the availability of basic utilities and even the availability of addictive drugs. There's more to admire too \u2014 there's a plot twist late in the game that I thought was skillfully executed. (I won't spoil it here.) Finally, our ostensibly addle-brained anti-heroine does a couple of things that I never would have thought of in order to survive. It also boasts an incongruously beautiful setting. (This was shot in Nevada's \"Valley of Fire.\") \"It Stains the Sands Red\" isn't perfect. There are a couple of stupid parts, particularly near the end of the story. (Were these otherwise talented screenwriters just running out of steam?) And there is one surprise plot development that will be sure to have some genre fans rolling their eyes and groaning. Also, the makeup effects for the monster were good enough, but not stellar. (Like many longtime fans of zombie horror, I think I've been spoiled by the genius of Greg Nicotero and Tom Savini.) I 'd still name this as a good move, however, and I'd recommend it.",
         "I love horror movies but this is definitely not one of them. It is painfully obvious that the other reviewer knows the people who made the movie personally so I felt compelled to leave an honest review. Bad acting, bad script, stupid, dumb, horrible, blah blah blah... you get the idea, you can skip this one Not sure what else to say but I have to have 10 lines for a review so this is the tenth line",
         "I actually liked the way the movie started and the premise of someone being stalked by a zombie in the desert, however, when the zombie turned from a rampaging killing machine to a personal pet, I couldn't watch any further. A original little gem basically became silly cinema.",
         "Boring movie with very unlike-able main character. I can never get behind a movie where the main (and really only significant) alive character is a crappy person and makes stupid decisions. At first I wondered, is this meant to be a comedy? Certainly its no horror nor a thriller. Black 'comedy' maybe. Annoying cheap drunk stripper coke head uses guy, shows shes a crap person, boringly gets chased by a very poor make-up-ed smalls, lets her misandry fly and over all proves she really is an unlike-able 'dumb broad'- would be a much more accurate summary of this movie. Would definitely recommend re-watching TWD for the 100th time over this. But in the pros - good use of landscape, actors aren't terrible and zombie sound effects are good.",
         "I think this is well written and I love Molly's character, well played by Brittany Allen. I give it a ten cuz it fits all of my requirements for a movie I'd watch twice and recommend to friends.. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I really enjoyed it and I could relate; watching a woman go through her own stupid mistakes to come out strong at the end.. kicken ass.. Zombies are well placed throughout the plot and the director did great at building tension and comedy relief.. Loved the music, it was a bonus and fit the action. I think if you like odd zombie movies like Wasting Away, He's Still Dead but He's Getting Warmer and even Undead or Alive, this one is worth watching,, you might not give it a ten like me but I think you'll enjoy.",
         "A woman with a dubious background finds herself standard in the desert pursued by a single zombie. She's not dressed for the occasion, it's hot and she has a plane to catch. I thought this was a great little movie. It wanders slightly off the path of your typical zombie flick and was a refreshing change. There are some areas that didn't quite gel with me. At one point the movie feels like an assignment for a college project, like the director had to use at least five visual affects to convey exhaustion in a single scene or something. The film takes a change in pace and plot at one point which I didn't think was needed. They could have happily stopped the film early and saved some money. The film is semi-serious with some school boy elements and occasional bits of humour. There are some cracks in the plot about how she overcomes the zombie but it is a zombie movie, so any viewer should know better than to tug at those threads anyway. An easy watch, not bad at all.",
         "From reading the ratings on this site, I expected very little from this movie. My expectations, in fact, were just to kill time. First, this is not a zombie movie. In this movie, Zombies are the background or backdrop. Second, the actress does an amazing job of getting views to dislike her as she thoughtlessly moves through a zombie outbreak. Then things turn (no spoilers here you have to watch) and she becomes someone I started to root for. I thought this was in interesting complement to the typical zombie stories that I watch.",
         "it doesn't get any worse than this, horrible acting, plot holes everywhere, and horrendous logic make this film a must ditch flick, don't go near it. The zombie is always right behind her then all of a sudden its gone and nowhere to be seen??? She would go into a house and all of a sudden she has time to sleep with no fear of the creature approaching?!?!? 'Its like the zombie would all of a sudden give her time to rest then come after her. Horrible Horrible Horrible!!",
         "This movie was even better than I expected and I was expecting a lot. The synopsis teases you but it doesn't give the whole picture. When you actually start watching it, there's no way, you'll walk away until it's over. It's that good. The acting, especially Molly's character was bang on, funny and intense when needed. Definitely a movie to add to your watch list. You won't regret it one bit.",
         "All movies have messages for the audience. This one is clear and plain for feminist propaganda, a women power story in a zombie world. Women are tough, resourceful and doesn't need men to survive. Men are retard, weak, heartless or rapist. That's it. This is the all movie. Should I mention the movie is also bad and full of stupid moments from the beginning to the end, should I say I would have came (or anyone) with a much better script within 10 minutes ? Yes, I 'm saying it, because this kind of movie is bad and harmful for the mind. Depicting the humanity (and especially targeting the men) acting low and messy in a extreme situation is wrong and false. This movie just spit on you. I rate this deplorable thing a -10 on 10.",
         "The protagonist is a truly ugly, slutty, drug user, who frolics through the desert with a zombie. Even playing fetch with it at one point. At times it's sadly comical. I don't see how anyone could enjoy this movie when the main character can't be identified with or liked. Thumbs Way Down On This One!",
         "Hey kids, it's post apocalypse zombie b-movie time! Just when ya think the living dead well has run completely dry, another twist on the very tiring, tiresome and tired subject matter comes to the local drive thru, er in. \"It Stains The Sands Red\" doesn't really live up to the ominous, gore foreshadowing title. Sure there's an early ketchuppy scene, but for the most part this is a remake of that old Bing Crosby, Bob Hope buddy buddy crossing the desert vehicle - without the homoerotic tension. We have Molly, the coke snorting stripper in ridiculous heels traipsing across death valley (a better name for the movie) with a very persistent but slow zombie in tow. They bond, in a master slash puppy manner, with the added excitement that puppy wouldn't mind biting the hand that feeds him. It's a terrific premise, and looks fabulous on the widescreen, but the stumbling blocks of typical b-movie limitations (low budget, hammy acting, plot holes) is too much to overcome. Zombie faithful will probably enjoy it, but for the rest I say: Enough with the zombies already!",
         "This is excellent, it boils down to 2 lead roles, 1 after halfway through the film, & superfluous characters are forgotten as you realise how true-to-life this woman is. No heroics, just another \"bar-fly\" who has to survive, & shows her disgust at what she has to do, all the while going through the desert in high-heeled shoes, leopard-skin pants & a b**b-tube :) Her empathy to the \"victims\" comes across as very real, & her strengths & weaknesses are very human, frustrating to watch, a welcome change from \"oh yeah xyz, a flabby, 40-year-old professor of languages, will climb this 40 foot rope no problem in a crisis\"",
         "...and unique! There's nothing else like it out there! Fun to watch.",
         "I just stumbled across this on one of the premium networks, and frankly expected more of the same - just another zombie retelling, which is kind of old, at this point. Boy, was I wrong. This story is so clever, and at times hilarious. The two main actors - Brittany Allen, as a coke-addicted stripper stranded in the desert, and Juan Riedinger a zombie in not-so-hot pursuit - are absolutely dead on. So to speak. I could see where zombie purists might not like it, simply because it's so unconventional, but I think it's a hidden gem.",
         "I never watch movies like this but I watched this one because Brittany Allen is in it, and I loved it. Brittany is in almost every minute of this film and she is amazing. I was pleasantly surprised by the high production values, the locations were great, the music was perfect, the photography was first class, the unfolding story line became more complex and interesting with flashbacks, it was all good. I'll watch it again and recommend it."

         "This is it. What humanity feared the most is already happening, as a virulent pandemic sweeps the globe from end to end like a pitiless scourge, leaving behind legions of freshly-animated decomposing zombies. Under those circumstances, in the carcass of a levelled Las Vegas, a totally unprepared exotic dancer, Molly, crosses the rugged terrain of the unforgiving desert, driven solely by the will to survive, and a motive even greater than her own life. However, she's not alone. Like a powerful flesh-magnet, Molly attracts a ferocious undead male who is craving for a bite of those fragrant and bright-red offals of hers--and wherever Molly goes, the walking dead predator follows. In the end, do zombies ever get tired?",
         "In the throes of a zombie apocalypse, a troubled woman from Las Vegas with a dark past finds herself stranded in the desert with a lone and ravenous zombie on her tail."
