         "Out of the hundreds of films and shows my four year old daughter has seen there are very few that I would confidently recommend as perfect for a little girl. \"Tinker Bell and the Great Fairy Rescue\" is one of these. Totally inoffensive and absolutely stunning production qualities make this one of the most pleasant films I have seen for children for many, many years. I am totally lost why this little visual masterpiece has had such little promotion. I recently saw a mother take a group of little girls to see Tim Burton's Alice in Wonder land and it was disturbing to see so many of them upset by the film. How was the mother to know that this PG rated version of a traditional children's story was going to be that far off the mark for the girls to enjoy. Maybe the title \"Tinker Bell and the Great Fairy Rescue\" makes it sound a little trite and lame but the actual film is totally beguiling and charming.",
         "A superbly made film in every way! I was stunned by the utter beauty and charm of this and the previous animated 'Tinkerbell' films a few years ago, with their introduction to the world of fairies. Colours are dazzling and sumptuous, imagery is almost 3D in appearance (yet sharper), the stories are well thought out, and in this third instalment - 'Tinkerbell and the Great Fairy Rescue', Disney does not disappoint! I can't enthuse enough about the 'Tinkerbell' films, as they do not have the frenetic, brash, sometimes over-the-top action sequences that many other animated films such as 'Tangled', and even the later 'Ice Age' films have. There are very exciting sequences however, but they are well balanced with other aspects of the film. They also don't have any smart-mouthed characters that are to be found in some animated films these days, and whom in my opinion are not good role-models for young children. I see a great many films of all genres, and I do not even have any children, but after I saw the first Tinkerbell film, I had found it so sweet and entertaining - and such a breath of fresh air in our often ugly world - that I bought the following films, and waited with anticipation to see them. Tinkerbell is so cute, (yet feisty) with a perfectly suited voice - that it makes you wish that fairies were real. Indeed, one becomes utterly submersed in Tinkerbell's fairyland adventures for the entire duration of the film - so well executed is it. I would go as far as to say that 'Tinkerbell and the Great Fairy Rescue' is the best animated film I have ever seen. Shrek, Finding Nemo, Madagascar,(to name but a few) pale by comparison. It is THAT good! If you have young children, and would like them to see completely innocent, thoroughly entertaining films with good values, you cannot do better than let them view the recent 'Tinkerbell' films. I'm very sure that you will enjoy them immensely too!",
         "This British Disney Toon studios production is true pixie-dust for the hopeful family viewer. Astonishing 3D-like 2D imagery (why can't all films look this amazing?) is completely captivating and as an adult I felt myself being whisked into the genuine Disney magic of 60s films like MARY POPPINS and POLLYANNA...... TINKERBELL FAIRY RESCUE has the absolutely most breathtaking visuals, computer driven but timeless and earthy in beauty and fantasy. This is a simple but clever and funny animated feature. And for little girls and their 56 year old daddies, there is a few tears and a lot of excitement to be shared. I really applaud the tone story and sheer gorgeousness of this utterly enchanting family film. TINKERBELL herself reminded me of 50s MGM Musical star and singing sensation Jane Powell at her most beautiful. What a success TINKERBELL FAIRY RESCUE is. If you were also gob-smacked at ARTHUR AND THE INVISIBLES' imagery that looked 3D but was actually 2D, then this too is for you and your family.",
         "I'm not sure what makes Tinker Bell so irresistible to small children, but Disney managed to expand upon the Peter Pan mythos and flesh out Tink as an independent, curious, kind yet temperamental fairy. This is Tink's third adventure, after Tinker Bell (2008) and Tinker Bell and The Lost Treasure (2009). This time, her native curiosity in how things work and her fascination with humans gets her in trouble and her friends must organize a rescue party, also a good opportunity for Vidia, the antagonist, to show her better side. The production values are good but not incredible compared to Pixar movies or even to Disney's own Bolt; still, I doubt that any child will notice that Cheese's fur doesn't sway for example. About the only thing that disappoints me is that the whole Disney Fairies franchise is more aimed at girls rather than boys, which is quite a shame, given Tink's personality. Overall, it's a nice family movie. My 6 years old son loved it and that's all it matters.",
         "The third TB is like the first two - funny, clever, cute, visually stunning. My little one (4) absolutely loved it, so did I. It kept her attention from beginning till the end, what I don't see every day. It's useless to speak about visuals - the colors are wonderful, as we are used to, the objects are elastic and \"real\" in the way an animated fairy tale can be. The story is also nice. This time there's much more space for Vidia, which tries to show her better side. Tinker Bell's friends known from the first two movies are also present, we are missing the \"management\" and the background crew, so the storyline is much more intimate. The coping-stone of the action is a little over the top (=7/10), but what the hell, it's a fairytale...",
         "This was my all-time favorite fairy movie. I sat down with my 2yr. old grand-daughter to watch this and neither of us moved except for her to giggle at parts and hug her silky pillow. To put a heart-warming real little girl in with fairies is a dream many of us have had and I found myself cheering. The visuals were excellent and all the pixie dust flying around made it a magical experience for both of us. I immediately let my friends with grandkids know how wonderful this movie was and strongly suggested they watch it with the kiddies. Although it is centered more for girls, I think boys will like it, too. The boy fairies are a big part of the rescue. I'm anxious to watch it again.",
         "I've seen the previews two Tinker Bell movies and by far this one is the best. This is how movies for young children should be made - yes it has adventures, fantasy creatures and magic, but at the same time the focuse is about the relation between a little girl and her father who dosen't aprove her to believe in faeries and magic. It's very ratable, sweet and charming, as well the bond between Tinker Bell and little girl. There are actually some funny jokes when it comes down to humor which is 100% safe for kids (no shock value) and it's great to see a film that dosen't really on pop-culture reference which is rare this day. Animation is good, characters are sympathetic, it's charming and has more then one good message for the kids. If you have kid between 4 and 7 they will love it! P.S. It's good to see Vidia becoming a good character :) In first movie she was almost a villain so the fact she evolves into much more positive character not only makes her more 3-dimentional but I think it's good for kids when you can have a very nasty character turn for better :)",
         "I have to say I liked the last two Tinkerbell movies, and wasn't expecting much. But once again I got a very sweet film, albeit one with imperfections such as the short length, one or two moments that could have been better paced and the odd moment of dialogue that doesn't quite convince. The animation once again is gorgeous, the music is memorable, the story is a cute and charming one with a message that is good and doesn't feel forced in how it's incorporated, the characters including Tinkerbell are likable and the voice work, what a delight it was to hear the wonderful Michael Sheen, is top notch. Overall, very sweet and I recommend it. 7/10 Bethany Cox",
         "I received this as a Christmas present last year gone and I decided to watch it last night. At first I had low expectations on it as it was a movie for 4 year olds to watch but I decided to hell with it to check it out. The story is based on the popular fairy Tinkerbell from Peter Pan. It's about Tinkerbell and her fairies who are not allowed to interact with humans So Tinkerbell later befriends a young girl named Lizzie who made a fairy house and Tinkerbell's friend accidentally locks her in the house. At first Tinkerbell is afraid of the young girl but later in the movie they become best friends. Lizzie's father in case you are wondering is apparently working in a museum and he doesn't believe in fairies at all(like Robert Philip in Enchanted if any of you seen or heard of this film). As for the film itself I truly enjoyed it as its all about befriending a fairy and I like watching movies like these even though I am so old and I should be watching R rated movies but I always loved kids movies as they are so fascinating and wonderful to watch. If you are like myself then check it out. Best scene:Where Tinkerbell sprinkles magic pixie dust on Lizzie and she can fly. Worst bit: None really If you liked Enchanted(the whole father daughter thing with the girl believing in fairy tales and the father not to believe in fairy tales) or the Tinkerbell franchise you will like this.",
         "Usually, a spin-off such as this would only appear as a straight-to-DVD movie, but due to the amazing sales in the UK, Tinkerbell and the Great Fairy Rescue will see Peter Pan's favourite fairy get a cinematic release; the first of the Disney fairies to be granted one. Tinkerbell, as any Pan fan will know, is a mischievous but resourceful individual who always manages to get herself into trouble. On the first day of Fairy Camp, Tink (Mae Whitman) gets distracted by a passing car and goes to investigate, dragging friend Vidia (Pamela Adlon) along for the ride. The car belongs to Dr. Griffiths (Michael Sheen) and his daughter Lizzie (Lauren Mote) who accidentally captures Tinkerbell. Vidia sees that Dr. Griffiths has a large butterfly collection and fears that Tink will also end up in a display case so she races back to Fairy Camp to enlist the other fairies, Rosetta (Kristin Chenoweth), Silvermist (Lucy Liu) and Iridessa (Raven-Symon√©), to help rescue her. Luckily for Tink, Lizzie loves fairies and the two have a great day together but what will happen when Dr. Griffiths finds her? The animation isn't particularly impressive but it definitely has touches of Disney flair, particularly in the charming pastel colouring and the storyline based around a single parent family \u2013 the Disney special. The film's heart revolves around the relationship between Lizzie and a father who has no time for her and dismisses her love of fairies as fantasy. Michael Sheen's voice takes on sweeter tones as a busy father whereas Lauren Mote comes across as almost too English \u2013 there's more than a little stage school training here. Kristin Chenoweth lends her considerable vocal talents to Rosetta, the Southern Belle fairy who doesn't like to get her hands dirty. I would have thought that a trained singer like Chenoweth would be included in the soundtrack but for some reason the director opted for the distracting tones of Disney brat Bridgit Mendler \u2013 more than a little oversight. With a running time of just 75 minutes, it might be a tad too short for the big screen but I'd definitely recommend a DVD purchase as it's short and sweet enough to keep the kids entertained at home, but might not be worth a trip to the cinema. It's fairly simplistic stuff but young children will get a dose of humour, action and heart without the trappings of a boring Summer blockbuster.",
         "After re watching this film I can safely say I thought it was terrible. Sure, despite the Tinkerbell movies (in my opinion) being TERRIBLE quality, this particular movie takes the cake for being the worst in my opinion. When focusing on the movies CGI the saturation is lovely however that doesn't make up for the dated look of the animation. In my opinion there are better movies made in 2010 with a lot clearer animation. Overall the only good things I can say about this movie is the color saturation, Background design and voice talent. Besides that, the film is ABYSMAL. I didn't care at all for the characters, the plot lacked any fret or tension and feels like barely anything happens. But the cream on top of the pile, is the black and white morals, the skeptic vs believer, and a very inane, and EXTREMELY sappy script. I also can't believe that a girl at 9 years of age, still believes in fairies. Girls at that age should be fully aware of the real world, and her reality SHOULD NOT be sugarcoated, and safety- blanketed, at that point. One thing that legitimately made me annoyed while watching this film, was the 'cat in the cradle' plot line. I don't like how the father was being portrayed as terrible for focusing on his job, and not his family; Sure parents need to focus on their families, but they won't have the money, or budget to be properly fed, or sheltered. Speaking of which, where's the mother? She's just non- existent to what the plot demands, which is sloppy writing! Overall, this movie was the worst Tinkerbell movie ever; It didn't have depth, complexity, intrigue, or thought-provoking messages. It instead shows a simplified, unrealistic, black and white view on the world, which is a RANCID message for little girls. Granted, I know that animated movies take a few years to make, but a finished product is a finished product.",

         "Oh the challenge of reviewing a children's movie! I've just watched this with my six year old. She was reasonably entertained by it. I find myself comparing this sequel to 2008's \"Tinkerbell.\" I thought that movie was better, in that it seemed to have a purpose to it - which helps to maintain the attention of an adult. The earlier movie introduced us to Tinkerbell in more detail than we've ever known her, and it provided an imaginative look at fairy life. This was a more straightforward adventure type movie. Tinkerbell finds herself captured by a little girl and the rest of the fairies set out to find her and bring her back to Pixie Hollow. There's a cuteness involved in watching the relationship between Tinkerbell and the little girl develop. There's some humour - particularly as the cat chases the fairies over the flying plates. Still, it seemed less substantial than its predecessor; the story not as interesting; the music (usually a strong point for Disney) very minimal. Make no mistake about it. This will please a six year old girl. For an adult the most satisfying part of this will not be watching the movie; it will be sitting and snuggling with the six year old girl who's watching the movie!",
         "In vacations with my 7 years nephews, the evening was dedicated to a kid movie. This day, they chose this movie and I decided to watch it with them as I have always like the magic and poetry of the Peter Pan's world (and also because i told them that Thinker would be my wife...). In less than five minutes, I knew that this movie was a failure: it was a bit like the body snatchers has invaded Neverland: the characters were there (Tinker Bell, the young daughter, the blind parents, the English countryside) but inside, they were unrecognizable due to the huge appliance of clich√©s: First, the fairy world looks a lot like the hobbit and the Shire! Next, the fairies looks like models and their friends are the usual nerd and the gentle obese. We don't know why there's no mother in the movie and the father's working obsession is very badly explained: Spielberg's \"Hook\" was more natural (Robin hadn't enough time to do all things) but here, it's nearly as the father locks his kid in her room to work easily! The rescue operation is highly inspired from \"Honey, I shrunk the kids\" and we have always the American negative attitude towards cats! In conclusion, it's a soulless, industrialized, marketing animation that hurts severely the Disney's magic and that makes Funland far, far away indeed!",
         "Saw the most disturbing anti-science propaganda in children's movie yesterday: \"Tinkerbell and the great fairy rescue\". Some highlights (lowlights?): - Tinkerbell laughing as she responds to a girl who explains the scientific reason behind seasons: \"That's what we fairies want people to believe\" A pro-science obsessive dad playing the role of a villain: ... He is so involved in his work that he is neglectful of his daughter. ... He gives his daughter a journal to document the natural world, daughter fills it with fairies, and he is oh-so-cruel to her when she fills it with pictures of fairies. Tinkerbell claims that leaves changing color, fireflies, and rainbows are all the work of fairies. Explanations for natural phenomena that fly in the face of everything science teaches kids - about chlorophyll, bio luminescence, and light refraction. Fairies ultimately showing how wrong the scientist dad was. I suspect the creationist propaganda machine was at work here. By the end I felt punched in my face and felt like the villain in the movie. Lizzie: I had no idea fairies were responsible for changing the seasons. I thought it had something to do with the earth's axis as it rotated around the sun. Tinker Bell: That's what we wanted you to think."
