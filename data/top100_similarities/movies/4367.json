      "synopsis": "The film opens with Croft in an Egyptian tomb, seeking a diamond at one end of a chamber. As she approaches she is attacked by a large robot. After an intense chase and battle, she disables it by ripping out its motivational circuits. She takes the diamond, which is revealed to be a memory card labeled 'Lara's Party Mix,' and inserts it into a laptop computer inside the robot, whereupon it plays music. Now it is revealed that the scene took place in a practice arena in Croft's home, and that her assistant, Bryce, programmed the robot, to challenge her in combat. It is the day of the first phase of a planetary alignment, culminating in a solar eclipse on the Earth, which happens once every 5,000 years. In Venice, the Illuminati search for a key to rejoin halves of \"the triangle,\" which must be done by the final phase of the alignment. Mr. Powell, an Illuminati member, makes assurances that they are almost ready, but in reality he has no idea where to find the key. Croft's butler, Hillary, tries to interest her in several projects, but she ignores them. 15 May, as Hillary is aware, is the day that Croft's father disappeared many years earlier. She has not recovered from his loss. Later that night, Croft has a dream reminding her what her father said about the alignment, and an object linked to it called the Triangle of Light. Waking, she is aware of a clock ticking. Searching for it, she discovers a secret chamber with a carriage clock that had spontaneously begun ticking. Bryce probes it and discovers a strange device hidden inside the clock. Since the device resembles a clock, Croft consults a clock expert friend of her father's, Mr. Wilson. She believes it is connected to the \"Triangle of Light,\" but Wilson disavows knowledge of the clock or the Triangle. Croft encounters Alex West, a fellow tomb raider with unscrupulous methods. They are attracted to each other, but Croft cannot abide his for-profit attitude. That night, Croft is contacted by Wilson, who tells her that he gave her name to a man named Manfred Powell in regards of the clock. In reality, Wilson is also a member of the Illuminati. The next day, Croft sees Powell in his home, and shows him photographs of the clock. Later, while discussing it with Bryce, she points out that Powell was lying about his knowledge. That night, armed commandos invade the house and steal the clock despite Croft's attempts to fend them off. The next morning, Croft receives a letter from her father, arranged to arrive after the beginning of the alignment, where he explains that the clock is the key to retrieve two halves of the mystic Triangle of Light, which is revealed to be an object of phenomenal destructive power that granted its wielder power over time and space. Initially housed in a city built by those who worshipped the object, misuse of the Triangle's power destroyed the city and so it was split into two halves; one was hidden in a tomb in Cambodia, the other half in the ruined city itself, in modern-day Siberia. Her father urges her to find and destroy both halves before the Illuminati can find it. In Cambodia, West figures out part of the puzzle on how to retrieve the triangle half, but Croft manages to successfully grab the piece and escape the temple after fighting off and destroying a huge six-armed guardian statue. She and Powell arrange to meet in Venice, since each of them has what the other needs to finish the Triangle. Powell proposes a partnership to find the Triangle, and informs Lara that her father was a member of the Illuminati, which she vehemently denies. Though hesitant at first, she, along with Bryce, meets with Powell for the trip to Siberia. Inside the tomb, there is a giant model of the solar system, which activates as the alignment nears completion. Croft retrieves the last half of the Triangle, but when Powell tries to complete it, the halves will not fuse. He realizes that Croft knows the solution to the puzzle, and kills West in order to persuade her to complete the Triangle to save both West's life and her father's. Croft reluctantly complies, and they then struggle for control of the Triangle, with Croft prevailing. Croft then finds herself in a strange alternate existence facing her father. He explains that it is a \"crossing\" of time and space, and urges her to destroy the Triangle instead of using it to save his life. She leaves her father and returns to the chamber, where time is slowly running backwards from the point where Powell killed West. Croft takes the knife he threw into West's chest and reverses it, then destroys the Triangle, which returns time to its normal flow and directs the knife into Powell's shoulder. The chamber begins to self-destruct, Everyone turns to leave, but Powell tells Croft that he killed her father and retrieved his pocket watch with a picture of Lara's mother inside. Croft fights him to retrieve it, killing him and escaping as the chamber comes down around her. At the mansion, Hillary and Bryce are shocked to see Croft wearing a dress. She goes into the garden to her father's memorial, then returns inside, where Bryce has a reprogrammed SIMON, ready to challenge Croft once again. Hillary reveals a silver tray holding Croft's pistols, which she takes with a smile.",

         "\"Tomb Raider\" is a harmless diversion that should please its core audience. I loved the performance of Angelina Jolie, who brings the computer game heroine Lara Croft to life. I watched an interview with Jolie in which she said that she really \"became Lara Croft\". With her mock British accent, Jolie is a lot of fun as the adventurer-archaeologist who is equal parts Bruce Wayne and Indiana Jones, but with a much better body. Taking its cue from the video game, the film's screenplay is more of a puzzle than a plot. The script is a patchwork of ideas that plays like a Greatest Hits collection of other films. It deals with end of the world stuff, but it never feels apocalyptic. It's controlled chaos, utterly lacking in surprise. The script jumps from one expected moment to the next, never apologizing for its lack of originality. At least Jolie understands the limitations of the script. There's enough conviction in her performance to make you want to believe in Lara Croft, the spunky heiress is who is equally at home in her spacious mansion or within the catacombs of a lost tomb. She's guided by the spirit (both literally and figuratively) of her late adventurer father, Lord Croft (Jon Voight), and assisted by an archaeologist Alex West (Daniel Craig) and cyber-geek creator Bryce (Noah Taylor). The film opens like \"Raiders of the Lost Ark,\" with Lara Croft deep inside one of those musty, dusty tombs. Instead of outrunning a giant boulder, Croft squares off against a mechanical monster, a robotic menace that seems to come out of nowhere. It doesn't. We learn that it's a creation of Bryce, used to keep Croft on her toes. Angelina Jolie made the perfect Lara Croft; her facial expressions and sly smirks added a personality to the flick that I can only imagine the video game is missing. She seemed smart, brave, and composed as well as full of emotion. Okay, maybe the parts with her father (real-life papa Jon Voight) were a little over the top, but since the whole movie is just eye-candy anyway they seemed to fit. The fight scenes among ruins got me. How can you not love Lara Croft jumping onto a swinging obelisk to smash a glass eye that holds the key to time, or sledding thru an ice cave being pulled by dogs? Or the scene where the villains jump through her castle windows as she rappels around the walls, smashing chandeliers and pistol-whipping bad guys? What's a girl to do but hop on her motorbike, take a guy out sideways, and race off at 100 miles an hour? Excellent.",
         "Angeline Jolie, gives us the female version of \"Indiana Jones\" in this wild cartoon-like adventure story, which is fun to watch. Being a mentally lightweight action film with no credibility (no villain ever harms Jolie in this film despite firepower that would take out some Third World countries) but our heroine is there to save the day, of course! Jolie mainly is there to show off her chest in tight tee-shirts and perform near-impossible stunts. To her credit, she went to extreme lengths to get herself physically-fit for the role. Audio-wise, this is a one of the better DVDs you will ever hear, with excellent use of the surround speakers. Nice scenery, a sharp picture and low profanity also are pluses. Yes, the action is a little much and too loud in spots but otherwise \"Tomb Raider\" is a fun adventure that is recommended to all. p.s. Skip the sequel; it's a weak one.",
         "The use of space in the bunjee-jumping-inside fight scene is masterful - all three dimensions are used in a clever way. But I only worked this out afterwards. It was the choreographer's work that was masterful; the idiots who filmed and edited it did their darndest to make it choppy, incoherent, and unexciting. As if that weren't enough, someone - it may have been the composer, it may have been the director - thought that the action scenes would be best accompanied by a tuneless, relentless, jackhammer techno beat. \"Tomb Raider\" is \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" emulated by people who haven't seen it. If they HAD seen it, they'd know that Spielberg edited his action sequences so as to let the audience know what was going on, to give us an idea of where the hero stood and what obstacles he faced; also that John Williams wrote actual MUSIC, complete with themes and chords and rhythms and consecutive bars that often as not differed from one another. I'm not familiar with the computer game - if I were, I would be doubly grateful to see Angelina Jolie in the leading role. It must get tiring looking at large computer-generated breasts that just SIT there, like cast-iron balloons. Oddly, the audience I was with tittered because Jolie's breasts bounced as she walked downstairs. I don't get the joke. That's what breasts, by and large, DO - those of Hollywood actresses being an unfortunate exception to the general rule. -Anyway, all this aside, Jolie was, as always, terrific, when the film allowed her to be. This wasn't often. Usually I can at least decipher the storyline of a film afterwards, but this one has me baffled. It SEEMS that the film's heroine, in order to Save the World, merely had to sit still and do nothing - and KNOWING this, she Endangered the World, so that she could later save it in a more rope-swinging, kick-boxing, ammo-expending fashion. But surely nobody would spend millions of dollars on a film with this central weakness ... would they?",
         "The best part in this movie was without a doubt sexy Angelina Jolie in the title role as Lara Croft.She was very HOT! I`m no fan of the game,but with no comparisons;the movie was good. Entertaining enough;no brains,no story,no heart,but full of special effects action.Jolie is good,so are her real life father Jon Voight but rest of cast is forgettable.This is very much like Indiana Jones,but much lesser memorable.A better script would have helped,but that`s not the point;this is supposed to be fun.Better than \"The Mummy\",but just another Indiana Jones clone.Anyway;it`s OK. Rating 6/10",
         "A fun movie, indeed in the line of the Indiana Jones' features. Nice effects, a strange and interesting plot which does make sense most of the time, some good acting by the team around Croft. The right thing if you want relax and take off to the world of fantasy for a short time.",
         "LORA CROFT: TOMB RAIDER / (2001) *** (out of four) By Blake French: At last, here is a successful screen adaptation from a video game. \"Lora Croft: Tomb Raider\" takes the plot seriously, and has a lot of fun with it. Unlike the silly \"Wing Commander\" and incompetent \"Mortal Combat,\" this movie soars with its physical potential. The movie experienced many production complications, therefore I excepted it to symbolize the three tedious years of filmmaking, the director who bailed out, the sexual harassment charges filed, and the 11 screenwriters who couldn't satisfy Paramount Pictures, the bill, and Eidos Interactive, the company that owns the video game. \"Lora Croft: Tomb Raider\" manages to pull past its problematic filmmaking process and provide audiences with what is expected from this action packed extravaganza. Academy Award winner Angelina Jolie portrays Lora Croft, who is a cross between Indiana Jones and James Bond. The role of Croft was not an easy accomplishment, even for Jolie. She endured great physical hardships during the shooting, including injuries to her knee, foot, and shoulder. It's a good thing that Jolie did the film, however, she's probably the only actress with the capabilities and physical appearance to handle such a role. Elizabeth Hurley, Sandra Bullock, Denise Richards, Ashley Judd, and Jennifer Love Hewitt were also among the actresses considered for the role. Any of those fine performers would have brought their own charm and delight to the role, but Croft feels perfect for Jolie. The disposable premise is not just a clothesline for various action sequences. It stands alone as a needlessly complicated plot contraption concocted out of desperation and deadlines. I am glad the actors took it so seriously; this material begs for parody. Lora Croft discovers a key-based clock unidentifiable even by an antique dealer. Meanwhile, a ruthless member of a powerful society named Manfred Powell (Iain Glen) is waiting for a planetary alignment that occurs once every 5,000 years. This event will give the holder of two separated pieces of a magical stone the power over time itself. Croft and Powell learn that the key will unlock the whereabouts of those missing halves. The rest of the plot follows the villains and heroes on their journey around the planet, searching for the various artifacts and precious instruments. The film will not disappoint action fans. Suspend disbelief and follow the film's absurd concepts, then the fast-paced action sequences, eye-popping special effects, and convincing sets will satisfy. The outcome of almost every single scene is as obvious as it is predictable, but that doesn't mean we enjoy the scenes any less. There are some exciting action sequences in \"Lora Croft: Tomb Raider,\" although it's easy to become lost in the action; the frequent cuts and camera tricks often interrupt the flow of the action. \"Lora Croft: Tomb Raider\" is a fun summer thrill ride. It's not a smart, savvy film, but compared to movies like \"The Mummy Returns\" it's a wake up call in the midst of a starving summer movie season. If you don't expect more than pointless action, you will get your money's worth.",
         "I don't play video games, had never heard of Tomb Raider. I stumbled across this film on cable and absolutely loved it! The person writing this usually tends to like movie classics and classical actresses. Rarely do I enjoy action films. This one is an exception. Angelina Jolie is spectacularly fit, and in top acting form for this physically demanding role. I admit that I like the multi-talented Jolie. I found her to be a very believable Lady Lara Croft. Her acting, stunts (which she did most of herself), and her wonderful diction with a British accent, were a true delight. I watched this movie on cable at least ten times before I did something very, very rare for me: I purchased the DVD. Barring this film, the ONLY pre-recorded movies I own are classics. The plot may be a bit on the thin side. It is, afterall, designed *after* a video game. Another thing I enjoyed about the film was the fact that while there was a great deal of violence, there was no unnecessary gore or vulgar language - read: buggar vs. what it could be. I have to highly recommend this film for anyone who enjoys pure escapism at it's best! My 75 year old mother liked the movie, and she has very good taste when film is involved.",
         "Synopsis Lady Lara Croft (Angelina Jolie) travels to exotic and dangerous locales in search of tombs and relics of lost civilizations. As the first interplanetary alignment in 5000 years approaches, Lara Croft faces her greatest challenge. Her mission is to recover two halves of an ancient metallic triangle hidden in underground chambers in Cambodia and Siberia. With the guidance of letters written by her late father, Lord Croft (Jon Voight), Lara sets out to recover the artifact which grants its holder the power to rule time. Along the way she faces dangerous opposition from of Manfred Powell (Iain Glen), an agent in the employ of The Illuminata, a sinister secret society determined top possess the artifact at any cost. And not even Bryce (Noah Taylor), Lara's erstwhile electronics assistant can help when the ancient forces are unleashed. My Review Based on the popular interactive video game, but not only for the fans, Lara Croft: Tomb Raider is a wonderfully visual, fantastic action-packed entertainment, full of amazing effects and a stunning, sensual super-heroine that really packs a punch. A fast-paced adventure in the vein of Indiana Jones and The Mummy, Lara is The Terminator's Sarah Connor of the 21st Century. She is everything you could wish her to be \u0096 cool, but oh so hot and totally in control, ready to save the universe. Her soft whimsical sighs reinforce her femininity and vulnerability. She is her own woman: sexy, confident, a dare devil and a tomboy but still a lady, in essence as well as name. And Angelina Jolie embodies the cartoon-like character with curvaceous abandon and extraordinary grace, athleticism, style and charisma. She is fabulous to watch \u0096 sexy, sassy and without question, all woman. The story speeds along faster than a speeding bullet, with slick editing, classy production design and superb cinematography from Australian Peter Menzies Jnr that showcases striking locations in Cambodia and Iceland. One of my favourite sequences shows Lara on a husky-drawn sleigh on a spectacular Icelandic skyline when the sun, the moon and the world seem to merge. Graeme Revell's score is wonderfully diverse and the script is well paced, never running out of ideas. There's a predictable butler (whose silver tray reveals some surprises), a nerdy in-house technology expert (Noah Taylor is fabulous) and a power-hungry villain who wants to control time. But of course, it's that special casting of Jolie's real-life father Jon Voight that adds an extra dimension. The violence is comic-book and the worst profanity uttered is 'bugger'. In every sense, there's more to Lara Croft: Tomb Raider than meets the eye; it's action plus and a spine-tingling, dashing escapist fantasy set to thrill.\"",
         "Lara Croft Tomb Raider may be the silliest movie to ever grace multiplex screens, but it may well be one of the most enjoyable to. The action is thick fast and stylish, the stunts so unbelievable you'll love them and little pieces of Angelina Jolie thrown in for good measure. The story is a B movie classic, Tomb Raider Lara Croft finds a clock that contains a powerful map. The map shows the way to the pieces of an artifact that if placed together when a planetary allignment occurs grants the bearer the power of God. However the evil group the Illumenati want the map for themselves and thus steal it from Lara. Lara then goes after the group in order to stop them from using it for evil. The acting is the campest of the year with Iain Glenn as the stand out. Jolie is the perfect person to play Lara and looks great in some of the action sequences. The supporting cast which includes Daniel Craig are very much background players but they add plenty of color and fun to the story. The Director Simon West, who is also responsible for the excellent Con Air deserves applause for catching the essence of the Video game perfectly. So sit back and relax because when it comes to Lara Croft Tomb Raider only a churl won't love it.",
         "The hype, the merchandising, the tagline, and even the box this movie came in, promised Angelina Jolie to be the \"Ultimate Superhero.\" Was Laura Croft (as portrayed here) the \"ultimate superhero?\" I'd have to say, \"Yes!\" The sets were all exquisite in design and architecture. The props were top of the line, state of the art Hollywood eye candy. The wardrobe, specifically that of Ms. Jolie, was quite well done, and while the character development did come late in the movie, I honestly found myself emotionally invested in her character. Frankly, I geuninely hope they make another \"Croft\" movie. I was so amused and entertained by the first one, I can't wait to see where she goes next. The elaborate sets and props were nearly awe-inspiring, delicately and cohesively tying the story together with the setting, and working to Jolie's advantage through demonstration of her talents and obvious hard work in preparation for this movie. If they DO make another, and I understand they already have at the time of this writing, I do hope they at least paid a good screen writer and kept the props manager from the last movie. As I have said so many times before, the little details add so much to a production; not just with this one, but any production, and they can often bridge the gap between avid fan and casual movie-goer enjoyment. All that having been said, the action is quite stimulating, and extremely well choreographed and executed by Jolie, thanks no doubt to her personal trainer Eddie Chow. The soundtrack was very \"now,\" with great songs as the background by Nine Inch Nails, Chemical Brothers, Groove Armada, Oxide & Neutrino, Delerium, Basement Jaxx, and more. Great music with the action and extremely creative set designs lend for a very enjoyable movie. It rates a 7.4/10 from... the Fiend :."

         "A member of a rich British aristocratic family, Lara Croft is a \"tomb raider\" who enjoys collecting ancient artifacts from ruins of temples, cities, etc. worldwide, and doesn't mind going through death-defying dangers to get them. She is skilled in hand-to-hand combat, weapons training, and foreign languages - and does them all in tight outfits. Well, the planets of the solar system are going into planetary alignment (Which occurs every 5,000 years), and a secret society called the Illuminati is seeking an ancient talisman that gives its possessor the ability to control time. However, they need a certain clock/key to help them in their search, and they have to find the talisman in one week or wait until the next planetary alignment to find it again. Lara happens to find that key hidden in a wall of her mansion. The Illuminati steal it, and Lara gets an old letter from her deceased father telling her about the society's agenda (Her father was also the one who hid the key). Now, she must retrieve the key and find and destroy the talisman before the Illuminati can get their hands on it.",
