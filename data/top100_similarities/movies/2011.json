In a last-ditch attempt to set things straight, Marty finds himself bound for 1955 and face to face with his teenage parents -- again.",

      "synopsis": "The movie opens where Back to the Future left off: October 26, 1985. Marty ( Michael J. Fox) opens the garage door and sees his 4X4, the one he longed for in Back to the Future. Jennifer Parker (now played by Elisabeth Shue) asks for a ride. Marty tells her that she is a sight for sore eyes, and wants to look at her. She says that he's acting like he hasn't seen her for a week. She asks if he's OK. When he sees his mom and dad, he says yeah. As they are about to kiss, there are three sonic booms and the DeLorean appears and screeches to a stop in the driveway. Doc ( Christopher Lloyd) jumps out and smashes into one of the trash cans. He frantically tells Marty that he has to come back with him. Marty sees his strange goggles and asks, \"Where?\" Doc answers, \"Back to the future!\" Doc rummages in the garbage can, and then grabs some banana peels and a discarded beer can. Marty asks him what he's doing, and Doc hastily claims he needs fuel. He opens the attached Mr. Fusion Home Energy Reactor, and puts the banana peels in, topping it off with the beer. Doc tells Marty to get in the car, but Marty protests, saying he just got here, and Jennifer and he are going to take the new truck for a spin. Doc tells Marty that they'll take her along, because this concerns her too. Marty wonders what happens to them in the future, Doc hesitates for a moment, before replying that they come out fine, but that something has to be done about their kids. After they get in, and Doc backs up into the street, Marty tells Doc that he had better back up, because they don't have enough road on the street to get up to 88 MPH. Doc quips, \"Roads? Where we're going, we don't need roads.\" As Doc is starting up the car, Biff Tannen ( Thomas F. Wilson) comes out of the house, and wants to show Marty the matchbooks he just got printed up for his auto detailing service, just in time to see the DeLorean fly away and vanish in a flash of light. \"A flying DeLorean?\" he asks, in disbelief. They reappear in the year 2015, and immediately find themselves flying against traffic. Doc crosses to the right direction. They descend into Hill Valley on October 21, 2015. Jennifer is confused, and Marty tells her they're in a time machine. She asks about their future, the wedding, and where they will live. Doc knocks her out with a sleep inducing \"alpha rhythm generator.\" He tells Marty that when she wakes up she'll think it was a dream. He says he did that because she was asking too many questions about her future, and she's not essential to his plans. The DeLorean lands in an alley in the middle of a rainstorm. Doc tells Marty to wait five more seconds, and the rain stops right on the tick, as promised. Doc says they have an efficient weather service now, much more efficient than the postal service. When Marty gets out, Doc peels off a rubber mask, saying he went to a rejuvenation clinic and got a natural overhaul. He says they added 30 or 40 years to his life (but he looks the same.) They also replaced his spleen and colon. Marty asks about his own future, if he'll be a rich rock star. Doc warns Marty that no one should know too much about their future. He tells Marty to change his clothes. Meanwhile, Doc spies on Marty's future son Marty Jr. (also played by Michael J. Fox), saying they're precisely on schedule. The clothes Doc has given Marty have power laces on the shoes, and a self-adjusting fit on the jacket. Doc tells him to pull out his pants pockets, because all kids wear them like that today. He gives Marty a multi-colored cap like his son, then tells him to go into the Café '80s (one of those not-well-executed nostalgic-themed restaurants) in exactly two minutes and order a Pepsi. A guy named Griff is going to show up and ask Marty whether he is in or out about \"tonight's opportunity\". Marty is to tell him he is out, say no, and come back immediately. Marty now asks what this has to do with his son. Doc shows Marty tomorrow's copy of USA Today, and Marty is shocked by what he reads: today, Martin McFly Jr. is going to be arrested for theft, and within 2 hours of his arrest, he will be tried, convicted, and sentenced to 15 years in the state penitentiary (the justice system works swiftly these days now that all lawyers have been abolished). To make matters worse, next week, Marty's daughter Marlene (also Michael J. Fox, in drag) will attempt to break her brother out and will get sentenced to 20 years in jail, causing a chain reaction that destroys Marty's entire family. Doc's alarm watch is late, but he will try to intercept the real Marty Jr. before he can get to the Café 80s. Before Marty goes, Doc warns him to be careful because Griff has some short circuits in his bionic implants. When Marty reaches the town square, he notices a pond in the middle where the park, and parking lot, used to be. A car is in the robotic Texaco service station. The movie theater is showing \"Jaws 19\". Suddenly a hologram of a giant shark comes from the theater, swoops down on Marty and \"bites\" him, scaring him. He's not satisfied that the shark still looks fake. An electronic billboard advertises Wilson Hover Conversion Systems. Marty sees an antique shop, where he notices unusual items like a B&W Macintosh computer, a lava lamp, and a Gray's Sports Almanac. The almanac lists sports results from the years 1950 to 2000. Marty goes into the Café '80s, which is full of nostalgic items from the 1980s. Several video screens are advertising the food & drink there; they are also the waiters. The screens use personalities from the 1980s: Michael Jackson, Ronald Reagan, and the Ayatollah Khomeini. They talk like Max Headroom. While waiting on Marty, Ronald and the Ayatollah talk at the same time, almost as if arguing. Marty tells them to stop, that he only wants a Pepsi; one quickly pops up. Biff, now an old man, walks to Marty, mistaking him for Marty Jr., and bopping him on the head with his cane that's topped by a small silver fist and tells Marty how he's going to flush his life down the toilet. Marty thinks Biff is talking about himself, and is confused. Biff knocks him on the head with his cane saying, \"Hello! Anybody home?\" Outside, Griff (also Thomas F. Wilson) lands his car. He comes in and angrily chews out his grandfather for not applying two full coats of wax to his car. Biff argues, but Griff makes him go outside and redo it. Marty asks Biff if he and Griff are related, and Biff knocks him on the head again before he leaves. Marty notices two boys (one played by a young Elijah Wood) turn on an antique shooting game. Marty offers to demonstrate, grabs the revolver control and shoots all the opponents, but they complain that the game is like a baby's toy because you have to use your hands; they leave. Marty Jr. peers in through the window. Unlike the real Marty, we see that his jacket sleeves are ill-fitting. He comes in and asks for a Pepsi. Marty panics and hides behind the counter. Griff and his gang ( Ricky Dean Logan, Darlene Vogel, and Jason Scott Lee) come in. Griff confronts Marty Jr. in the typical Tannen way, and beats him. He asks Marty Jr. if he made a decision about \"tonight's opportunity.\" Marty Jr. says it might be dangerous, that he has to discuss it with his father. Griff throws him behind the counter. Marty orders Marty Jr. to keep quiet; Marty Jr. faints. Marty now stands up as Griff demands he give the right answer. Marty gives a firm no, then departs. Griff calls Marty chicken, hiding a telescoping bat behind his back. Marty, being Marty, can't resist when someone calls him chicken. Just as he's saying such, Griff swings at Marty with his bat and misses, hitting a video waiter. When Marty puts up his dukes, Griff rises up about half a foot with his implants. Marty throws a punch at Griff, who easily blocks it. Marty kicks Griff between the legs and pushes him against his gang. Marty runs out the door, and Griff and his gang run after him. Outside, Biff is waxing Griff's car. Marty passes him and sees two kids with what he thinks are scooters. When he grabs one of the \"scooters\", he's surprised to find it is actually a Mattel hoverboard. As in Back to the Future, he rips off the handle for the board, giving the girl the handle. Griff and his gang chase after Marty in Griff's car. Marty hangs onto the back of a passing Jeep. Biff observes the chase, and reminded of his encounter with the manure truck accident in 1955, quips, \"There's something very familiar about all of this.\" Marty grabs onto a rope from the Jeep's back like a water surfer would be attached to a boat. When Griff swings at him, Marty swerves over the water, and the board stops. The gang tells Marty that hoverboards don't work over water \"unless you've got power.\" Griff gets out his \"Pit Bull\", a jet-powered hoverboard, ready to hit Marty with his bat. The gang hooks up to the back of the Pit Bull, and all four of them fly across the water towards Marty. At the last second, Griff swings, but Marty jumps down into the water, and Griff misses. The gang fly out of control and smash through the glass windows of the courthouse. Marty climbs out of the water in time to see the gang being arrested, then flees through a pedestrian tunnel and exits out the other side. He pulls a cord on his jacket, and it blow-dries itself and his hair. Marty tries to give the girl back her hoverboard, but she declines, as she now has one of the gang's Pit Bulls. A man asks for a donation to save the clock tower. An electronic billboard flashes that the Cubs win the World Series, sweeping Miami. Marty is incredulous about Miami. The man then tells Marty he wishes he could go back to the beginning of the season and put some money on the Cubs. This gives Marty an idea. Marty goes back to the antique shop and buys the sports almanac. He goes outside, looking inside the almanac, and says he can't lose. Doc arrives and tells Marty to wait. Biff comes around the corner and sees the flying DeLorean. He remarks that he hasn't seen one of those in 30 years. Marty Jr. comes out and bumps into Biff. Biff looks back and forth at Marty and Marty Jr., confused. A car almost hits Marty Jr. Doc looks at the courthouse and asks Marty what happened. Marty says, \"My kid showed up and all hell broke loose\". Doc sits down and says he was afraid of this. He says that after he zapped Jennifer with the sleep inducer, there wasn't enough power to knock his son out for a full hour. Biff sees Doc and hides. Marty tells Doc that the newspaper is changing. As they watch, the headline changes from 'YOUTH JAILED; Martin McFly, Jr. Arrested for Theft' to say 'GANG JAILED; HOVERBOARD RAMPAGE DESTROYS COURTHOUSE; GANG LEADER: 'I WAS FRAMED'. They look over and as he's being led to a police car in handcuffs, Griff shouts \"I was framed!\" to a USA Today camera probe. Doc tells Marty that his son won't go to jail; future history has been changed. He tells Marty that they succeeded, and can get Jennifer and go home. Marty accidentally drops the almanac and Doc picks it up. Doc tells Marty that he didn't invent the time machine for financial gain. Doc starts to put the almanac in the trash, but sees the police; they hide around the corner. Two cops ( Mary Ellen Trainor and Stephanie Williams) have found Jennifer, and ID her with a handheld device: \"McFly, Jennifer Jane Parker, 3793 Oakhurst Street, Hilldale, age 47.\" They are surprised she looks so young. Doc tells Marty that because the thumbprint never changes over the years, they assume she's the Jennifer of the future. Marty tells Doc that they have to stop them. Doc asks him, \"What will we say, that we're time travelers? They'll have us committed.\" One of the cops says she's clean (i.e. no outstanding warrants), so they can take her home to Hilldale. Doc tells Marty that the cops are taking Jennifer to Marty's future home. He says they can arrive there shortly after the cops do and take her back to 1985. Marty is excited about seeing his future home and himself as an old man. Doc says no, then panics. He says, \"Jennifer could conceivably see her future self. The consequences could be disastrous. There are two possibilities: 1. Face-to-face with her future self, she simply passes out. 2. The encounter creates a paradox, which starts a chain reaction and unravels the very fabric of the space-time continuum and destroy the entire universe.\" The police car flies by, and Doc and Marty hide against the wall. Doc hopes that they can find Jennifer before she finds herself. Looking at the digital sign, Doc says the skyway is jammed, and will take forever to get there. Doc tells Marty he didn't invent the time machine to win at gambling; he invented it to travel through time. He throws the almanac in a trash can, and they leave. Unknown to either Doc or Marty, Biff is hiding past a screen door, comes out, and retrieves the almanac. The police car arrives in Hilldale at night, and land at the McFly (2015) house. One cop says that Hilldale is \"nothing but a breeding place for tranks, lobos, and zipheads.\" The other one agrees, saying that they should tear it down. The cops take Jennifer to the house, and use her thumbprint to open the front door. When she wakes, they tell her she got a little \"tranked\", but can walk. They tell her it's dangerous without the lights on. She asks, \"Lights on?\" The lights come on, and they sit her down on the couch. One of the cops tells her to be careful in the future. Jennifer asks, \"The future?\" The cops leave. Jennifer looks at the window in front of her, but sees a giant video screen, broadcasting the 24 hr/day scenery channel. She says to herself that she's in the future. Her daughter walks around upstairs, but they don't see each other. Jennifer sees framed wedding photos of her and Marty, and picks one up. She's incredulous (and disappointed) that she gets married in a \"Chapel O'Love\" (and in the photo, we see that Marty is wearing a tux-patterned shirt, and Jennifer wears a very short skirt). When the doorbell rings, Jennifer's daughter (also Michael J. Fox), identified as Marlene when her grandparents George and Lorraine come in, asks, \"Mom is that you?\" Jennifer drops the photo and tries the front door, but there's no doorknob. The doorbell rings and Jennifer hides in the closet under the stairs. Jennifer looks through the slats of the closet door, but can't see her daughter as she opens the front door. Lorraine ( Lea Thompson) and George ( Jeffrey Weissman) come in. Marlene asks what happened to her grandpa's back. Lorraine says he threw his back out again on the golf course. George floats in upside down. Lorraine asks Marlene if her folks are home yet. Lorraine is holding a small pizza in a sandwich bag, saying she bought pizza for everyone. Doc, our Marty, and Einstein are flying in the DeLorean, stuck in traffic. Doc says that old Jennifer (Jennifer 2015) usually gets home around this time, and he hopes they're not too late. Doc grabs his goggles worriedly. Marty asks him what's the matter. Doc says he thought he saw a taxi in his rear display that he thought was following them. Inside the McFly house, Lorraine is changing channels on the screen scene, saying she can't believe the window is still broken. Marlene says that when the repairman called her dad chicken, he threw him out of the house, and now can't get anybody to fix it. Lorraine lifts it up, revealing the window. She tells Marlene that her father's biggest problem is that he loses all self-control when somebody calls him chicken. Lorraine and George say together, \"Mom, I can't let them think I'm chicken.\" Lorraine continues to explain how in 1985, Marty Sr. got into a car accident where he got into a collision with a Rolls-Royce when someone challenged him to a drag race to prove he wasn't \"chicken\". The DeLorean lands outside the McFly house at night. Doc gets out, taking Einstein with him to find Jennifer. Doc tells Marty to stay there and change clothes. Marty protests, but Doc says they can't risk him running into his older self. Doc runs away with Einstein. Marty is pleasantly surprised that he will live in Hilldale. The taxi that was following the DeLorean in traffic arrives, landing down the street. After Biff pays with his thumbprint, he sneaks and hides by a waste recycling station. Lorraine continues her narrative to Marlene, saying that the accident Marty Sr. got into caused a chain reaction that has ruined his life. Had he not participated in that race, the driver of the Rolls Royce wouldn't have pressed charges and Marty wouldn't have broken his hand, he wouldn't have given up on his music career, and he wouldn't have spent the last few decades feeling sorry for himself. At that point, Jennifer hears the door open and hides in the den closet when Marty Sr. ( Michael J. Fox with his hair dyed gray) comes in. She watches as Marty Jr. turns on the TV and watches several channels at the same time. Outside, our Marty is fascinated by a robotic dog walker and carelessly leaves the DeLorean's door open when he follows the dog. Biff gets in and then flies away. Lorraine puts a tiny Pizza Hut pizza in a Black and Decker Hydrator, which is completed 3 seconds, restored to full size and cooked. Lorraine is worried about Jennifer. Marty Sr. doesn't know where Jennifer is. He says she's probably in one of her mood swings. The phone rings, and Marty Sr. takes it on the large video phone in the den. It's his coworker, Douglas Needles ( Flea), who wants Marty Sr. to join him in an illegal business venture. Marty Sr. balks until Needles calls him chicken. Marty Sr. says he'll do it, and scans his card, and then Needles hangs up. Marty Sr.'s boss, Ito Fujitsu ( Jim Ishida), immediately comes on the phone, telling Marty Sr. that he was monitoring the card scan. He promptly fires Marty Sr. and sends out a fax saying \"YOU'RE FIRED!!!\" to all the fax machines in the house. Jennifer takes one of the faxes. At that point, Doc knocks on the window and tells Jennifer to go out the front door and meet him there. She says the door won't open, and he tells her to press her thumb to the plate. She tries to sneak out, but Marty Sr. is playing the guitar in the living room. Lorraine talks with him and they both leave the living room. Jennifer tries to leave, but Jennifer (2015) ( Elisabeth Shue) opens the door and Jennifer hides behind the wall. When Jennifer (2015) comes in they both faint, shocked at seeing each other. Doc catches the young Jennifer. Old Biff returns in the DeLorean. When he gets out of the car, he pulls out his cane too quickly and hits himself in the chest, breaking off the top of the cane in the car as he leaves (a deleted scene then shows him collapsing behind another car and fading out of existence). Doc calls Marty over, telling him that she fainted when she saw her old self, but she'll be fine. As they carry Jennifer back to the DeLorean, Doc tells Marty that when they get back he's going to destroy the time machine, saying that this shows the danger of time travel. They put her in the DeLorean. Doc tells Marty he wants to go to the Old West but it's too dangerous. He puts some garbage in Mr. Fusion. Doc, Marty, Jennifer, and Einstein arrive back in 1985, narrowly missing a jet as they appear. Doc and Marty put Jennifer in the swing on the porch of her house. Doc tells Marty to come back later in his truck and wake her up, and try to convince her it was a dream. Doc says she will probably sleep for a couple of hours. The first indication that something isn't right when Marty remarks that he doesn't remember security bars on the windows on Jennifer's house, or that the vehicle parked out front is wrecked. Doc drives to Marty's house. Due to the darkness, they fail to notice that the Lyon Estates statues have been defaced with graffiti, or a pack of stray dogs roaming the streets. Doc leaves. Marty can't open the gate to his back yard because it's locked with a padlock, so he jumps the fence. He opens the window to his bedroom and falls onto a bed in the room. To his shock, a black girl wakes up and screams \"Rape!\" Her father runs in and chases Marty out of the house with a baseball bat. As Marty runs, the man yells after him that they refuse to be terrorized into selling their house to the real estate company. Marty runs down the dark street, which is lined with wrecked and abandoned cars, including an abandoned police car. Gunshots are heard in the distance and a girl is heard screaming. Marty then comes upon the chalk outlines of two recent drive-by shooting victims. As Marty crosses another street, three police cars race by, sirens wailing. Marty is shocked, and figures he's in the wrong year. He finds a newspaper on the porch of a house that reads October 26, 1985, meaning he is in the right year, but in the wrong timeline. Suddenly, a shotgun is trained at Marty's head. It's Strickland ( James Tolkan), who doesn't recognize Marty and thinks he is the gangbanger who has been swiping newspapers from his porch. Marty asks him why he doesn't recognize him from school, and Strickland reveals that the school was burned down by vandals six years ago. He prepares to shoot Marty's testicles off, but Marty is saved from such a potential ending when a car comes around the corner and some gangsters who recognize Strickland open fire with submachine guns, raking his house with bullets. Strickland dives into the house while Marty ducks down. As soon as the gangsters are gone, Marty stands back up, but Strickland suddenly rushes out of the house, and fires two blasts at the fleeing car, shouting \"Eat lead, slackers!\" As Marty finds himself in the middle of \"Hell\" Valley, he bumps into Red ( George 'Buck' Flower), the bum from before, telling him \"Watch where you're going, crazy drunk pedestrian!\" Marty turns around and sees a huge casino called Biff Tannen's Pleasure Paradise anchoring the town square where the courthouse should be. There is a biker gang circling the square. A tank passes by in the street, giving the feel of a war zone. There is a toxic waste reclamation plant across the street. In the lobby of the casino, a video in the museum narrates Biff's life and success. It invites the visitor to learn the amazing history of the Tannen family, starting with Biff's great-grandfather Buford \"Mad Dog\" Tannen, the fastest gun in the west. You can see Biff's humble beginnings, and learn how Biff became a millionaire overnight from a large bet he made at a horse race on his 21st birthday, which led to a long winning streak that left newspapers dubbing him \"The luckiest man on Earth.\" He subsequently parlayed his fortune to found Biffco, which runs a realty company and several nuclear powerplants. In 1979, Biff successfully lobbied to legalize gambling and converted the dilapidated courthouse into a beautiful casino hotel. You can even meet the famous women Biff dated (such as Marilyn Monroe and Jayne Mansfield) as he searched for true love, and relieve his happiest moment as in 1973, he realized his lifelong dream by marrying his high school sweetheart, Lorraine Baines McFly. Marty screams in shock, just as Biff's goons, his old friends from high school, Match, Skinhead and 3D appear and knock Marty out. Marty wakes up in the dark and sees his mother ( Lea Thompson), asking if that's her. She tells him to relax, that he's been asleep for almost 2 hours. He thinks it was a nightmare. She tells him that he's safe and sound on the 27th floor and turns on the lights. He bolts up and is shocked to see that Lorraine is an alcoholic with breast implants. She tells Marty to wait for his father. Marty asks, \"Father?\" Biff bursts in and angrily demands to know why Marty is not in Switzerland (implying that in this alternate reality, Marty and his siblings were shipped away to overseas boarding schools). Biff warns Lorraine that Marty is a butthead just like his father. Lorraine defends George, telling Biff that he's not even half the man he was. Biff pushes her down. Marty rushes at Biff, but Biff's men grab Marty. Biff punches Marty in the stomach. Lorraine snaps and tells Biff she's leaving. Biff asks her who will pay for her clothes, jewelry, liquor, and cosmetic surgery. Lorraine argues back that he's the one who wanted \"these things\", cupping her breasts. He scares her into staying by threatening to cut Lorraine off from his money, cancel Linda's credit cards, revoke Dave's probation, and put Marty and them all in jail, just like her brother Joey (perhaps the one thing in this alternate timeline that is not different from the original timeline). Biff leaves, warning her that he'll be back in an hour but Marty better not be. Lorraine tells Marty that Biff was right and she was wrong, and then pours herself a drink. Marty is shocked, wondering how she could leave George for Biff. She decides that Biff's gang must have hit Marty too hard this time, implying that in this alternate reality, Biff has a habit of hitting Marty over the head as punishment very frequently. Marty asks where his father George is. Lorraine reveals that he's where he's been for the past 12 years, at Oak Park Cemetery. Marty goes to the cemetery, and finds his father's tombstone. It shows that he died on March 15, 1973. Marty is stunned and Doc steps out of the shadows, saying it's all true. Doc admits he knew Marty would come here when Marty learned about his father. Doc and Marty go to Doc's lab. Doc shows Marty newspapers from the library, which was closed down. Marty tears out the page of the newspaper that reports his father was shot dead in an alleyway while on his way to get an award. Doc explains that something caused a temporal distortion; somewhere in the past, the timeline skewed off into an alternate reality. On a chalkboard, he draws the normal timeline and the alternate timeline (1985A), which is normal for everyone else. Doc shows Marty the bag and receipt for the Gray's Sports Almanac, and Biff's fist-shaped cane top that he found on the floor of the DeLorean. It means that Biff stole the time machine and gave the almanac to himself in the past. He then shows Marty a newspaper article about the horse race Biff won a big bet on in 1958. On the front page is a photo of Biff holding a large fake cutout of a check while being interviewed by reporters. Marty uses a magnifying glass to blow up the photo, and sees the almanac is stuffed into Biff's right front pocket. Doc says this is how time travel can be misused. Marty realizes that it's his fault, and they have to go to the future to stop Biff from stealing the time machine. Doc tells him that this will not work because they would only go to this alternate future - where Biff is corrupt and powerful, married to Lorraine, and where a newspaper article shows that Doc has been committed to an insane asylum as part of one of Biff's smear campaigns. He tells Marty that they have to go the past and get the almanac, and they have to find out how and when Biff got the almanac. Marty says he will ask him. Biff is in a jacuzzi with two topless women, watching \"A Fistful of Dollars\" on TV (the importance of this movie will become apparent in Back to the Future Part III.) Marty comes in and turns off the TV with the remote, and confronts Biff about the Grays Sports Almanac. Biff sends the women out. He asks Marty what else he knows about the book. Marty demands to know how, where, and when he got the book. Biff tells (orders) him to sit down. He says, \"November 12, 1955\", then opens a safe. Marty says that was the date of the lightning storm. Biff says that it was a Saturday, and he crashed his car drag racing. Marty, however, knows that Biff crashed into a manure truck, that his father told him about it before he died. Biff continues, saying that a \"crazy old codger\" (his old self) gave him the almanac, asking him how would he like to be rich, and that he was a distant relative. Biff claims he didn't see the resemblance. Biff reveals that his old self told him he was going to be rich, and when Biff asked if there was a catch about the almanac, the old self told him, \"No catch; just keep it a secret.\" Biff says he never saw him again. While Biff turns his back to put the almanac back in the safe, Marty takes one of the matchbooks from an ashtray. Biff then remembers something else: old Biff warned him that \"Someday a crazy wild-eyed scientist or a kid will show up. If that ever happens[, kill him]....\" Biff pulls out a snub nose revolver, saying he didn't think it would be Marty, and prepares to shoot him. Marty throws the ashtray at Biff, but he ducks and the ashtray sticks into Biff's chair. Marty runs upstairs, and Biff shoots at him several times, but misses. The three guys who grabbed Marty outside see him go downstairs, but he jumps the other flight of stairs and goes back upstairs to the roof instead, while they go downstairs. Biff catches up and sees the door to the roof swinging, and follows Marty. He tells Marty to jump, that suicide would be nice and neat. Marty warns the police will trace the bullet, but Biff brags that he owns the police; and that is how he was able to get away with murdering George. Marty jumps over the ledge and Biff can't believe it. He calls Marty an idiot, and then looks over the ledge. Marty comes up on the DeLorean, and the door knocks Biff out. Doc and Marty fly away. Doc sets the time machine for November 12, 1955. The display malfunctions and shuts off; Doc hits it and it returns. Doc tells Marty it's unbelievable that old Biff chose that date, that it must have cosmic significance. Doc and Marty return to the morning of November 12, 1955 and hide the DeLorean behind the Lyon Estates billboard, much like Marty did when he first arrived. Doc tells Marty he will repair the short in the time circuit. He tells Marty to get the book back, but warns him to be careful not to run into his other self. He gives Marty some 1955 money from an emergency money suitcase containing US money from different periods, and tells him to buy some inconspicuous clothes. The next morning, Marty has a pair of binoculars and is dressed like a 50s greaser in a leather jacket and wearing a hat, like a spy. He is communicating with Doc via two-way radio and outside the house of Gertrude Tannen, the only Tannen listed in the phone directory. Marty is skeptical that Biff lives here...just as Biff comes out of the house, looking exasperated with his grandmother. He follows Biff to a mechanic's shop in the middle of town. Terry, the mechanic who repaired Biff's car after the manure truck incident, drops it off, and Biff is outraged to find that the repair bill is $300, including an $80 fee from Jones to remove the manure. We see Old Biff is hiding behind a tree, chuckling as he recalls the incident. Biff and the mechanic go into the shop to argue about getting a refund for the fee Jones is charging Biff, during which Marty climbs into the back of Biff's car. Minutes later, Biff and the mechanic return, still arguing. Biff tosses a few oil cans in the back of the car, much to Marty's discomfort. The argument ends as the mechanic drives away in a hurry, fed up with Biff. Just then, Biff is distracted when he sees Lorraine and one of her friends rush out of a dress shop a few doors down the street, excitedly admiring the dress Lorraine has just purchased for the dance. His mood brightens, and he goes over to harass her. He wants her to go with him to the dance, but she counters she's going with \"Calvin Klein\" (Marty's alter ego). Biff is infuriated, he's not happy that Lorraine doesn't want him, and gets more forceful with her. Lorraine gets more annoyed, finally telling Biff she won't go with him to the dance even if he had a million dollars. To express her opinion, she kicks him in the knee, then clocks him over the head with her dress box and runs off even as Biff taunts her that she is going to be his wife one day. Biff goes back to his car and finds old Biff sitting in the driver's seat. Biff, exasperated, tells old Biff to leave, but old Biff starts the car, shocking Biff. Old Biff tells Biff to get in, telling him it's his lucky day. The scene cuts to Old Biff driving Biff rather recklessly back to Biff's house, scaring the hell out of Biff. As they park in the garage, Biff demands to know how old Biff knows where he lives. Old Biff gives Biff the almanac, telling him it will make him rich. Old Biff explains that it lists sports results from 1950 to 2000. Biff tosses it back and tells old Biff to \"Make like a tree and get out of here!\" Old Biff slaps him in the back of the head & corrects him, \"It's leave, you idiot!\" Biff demands proof that the almanac is what old Biff makes it out to be. Old Biff turns on the radio to a football game, and surprises Biff when he announces that UCLA, trailing 17-16 with 20 seconds to go on the clock, will win 19-17. UCLA wins 19-17. Old Biff tells Biff to always bet on the winner, and gives Biff back the almanac. Biff tosses it in the back of the car, but old Biff grabs it before Marty can and stuffs it into the back pocket of Biff's pants. Old Biff and Biff close the the garage door and walk away as Old Biff warns Biff about Marty or Doc coming to confront him about the almanac. Marty gets out of the car and tries to follow them, but the garage door is locked with a padlock. He calls Doc on his walkie-talkie, telling him Biff and old Biff left with with the book; Doc radios that he'll find a way to get there without a car. That night, Biff comes back to the garage while having to deal with his domineering grandmother yelling at him. He opens the garage and gets into his car, preparing to leave for the dance. Marty gets in the back of the car without Biff noticing. Doc passes the car just after they leave and sees the open garage door, wondering where Marty is. As he drives into town, Biff listens to \"Papa Loves Mambo\" by Perry Como on the radio. Marty calls Doc. Doc sees the tarp that covers the DeLorean. Marty tells Doc they are going to the dance. Doc tells Marty that they need a new plan; it's too dangerous. Marty tells Doc that he's in Biff's car. Doc warns Marty that he must not let his other self see him because of the consequences. Just then, the 1955 Doc appears and asks 1985 Doc to get a wrench from the toolbox. Doc asks him if he's doing a weather experiment, surprising him. Doc says that he has experience in this. Doc (1955) suggests that maybe they'll bump into each other in the future. As 1985 Doc rides away on his bicycle, 1955 Doc looks at the back of Doc's head, and does a double take. Biff (and Marty) arrive at the dance. Biff takes the almanac with him; Marty follows Biff inside. The band is playing and students are dancing. Marty sees through the binoculars that George is dancing alone. He also sees Biff's gang Match, Skinhead and 3D spiking the punch with liquor, and sees the almanac in Biff's back pants pocket. They quickly have to retreat when Strickland notices them. Biff and his gang leave; Marty follows them. Biff tells his gang that he's still looking for Calvin Klein because he caused $300 damage to his car. The gang goes back inside, but Biff stays outside, and reads the almanac after tossing the liquor bottle away. Marty sees his counterpart drive up with Lorraine. He sees the almanac in Biff's back pocket, and jumps down. Biff looks around, hearing a noise, but doesn't see anyone. Just as Marty is about to grab the almanac, Strickland surprises Biff, who turns around. Strickland detects a whiff of alcohol on Biff's mouth. He confiscates the almanac, calling Biff a slacker, and walks away; Marty secretly follows him. Strickland goes to his office and drinks coffee, spiking it with liquor. Marty enters quietly, but hides under the desk when the door noisily swings shut. When Marty reaches for the almanac, Strickland backs up in his chair against Marty's hand; Marty stifles a scream. Strickland leaves and tosses the almanac in the trash can. Marty retrieves the almanac, but finds out it's a girlie magazine; only the cover was from the almanac. He calls Doc and tells him that Biff must still have the almanac. Through the window, we can see George's struggle with Biff. Marty hears the ruckus and runs outside. He arrives just as George punches Biff, and sees his counterpart and the crowd. Marty's counterpart looks at the photo (as before) and runs away. Marty comes in and tells the crowd gathering around Biff to back off, and then tells them he knows CPR. A guy asks, \"What's CPR?\" Biff wakes up, and recognizes Marty as \"Calvin Klein,\" but Marty punches him and knocks him back out, then takes the almanac. The bystander thinks that Marty just pickpocketed Biff's wallet. Biff's gang chases Marty. Doc is trying to fly, and the time machine's display changes to January 1, 1885. At the dance, Marty sees George and Lorraine, and his 1985 counterpart. George and Lorraine kiss. Biff's gang enters, and Marty hides under a table. The gang sees Marty's counterpart on stage about to play \"Johnny B. Goode\", and prepare to nab him. Marty calls Doc, who tells him his counterpart will miss the 10:04 PM lightning bolt at the clock tower. Doc tells Marty he has to help his counterpart at all costs, or there will be a time paradox. Outside, Biff comes around, hearing Marty's counterpart playing \"Johnny B. Goode,\" and asks the bystanders where Marty has gone. The guy who saw Marty take the almanac tells Biff where Marty went, and Biff heads into the building. Marty sees Biff's gang backstage. He goes backstage, climbs up into the overhead rafters and pulls the ropes, releasing the stage weights (sandbags) on the gang just as Marty's counterpart finishes playing the high note. Marty swings down and drops the bags again, knocking the gang out. Marty calls Doc, who tells him to meet on the roof of the gym in one minute. Marty leaves, and through the door window sees his counterpart talking to Lorraine and George. Biff suddenly appears, nose bloodied, and not fooled at all by Marty's \"disguise\". Marty tries to walk away from a potential fight, only for Biff to call him chicken. Before Marty can fight Biff, his counterpart slams the door open, knocking him down. After counterpart Marty leaves, Biff sees the almanac in Marty's hand. Furious, he kicks Marty for taking the almanac, damaging his car, and humiliating him, then marches to his car and drives away. Marty makes it to the roof of the gym and tells Doc that Biff has stolen the book. They follow Biff, flying over him in the DeLorean. They sneak up quietly behind Biff's car. Marty gets on the hoverboard, hiding behind the back of Biff's car, and Doc flies away. Biff turns, thinking he heard a noise, but doesn't see Marty. Marty pulls up to the passenger side of the car and sees the almanac. Biff, listening to sports on the radio, reaches for the almanac to check the scores just announced, and then puts it back on the seat, memorizing them for later use. Marty opens the door, but Biff sees him. A struggle ensues as Biff enters a tunnel, trying to smash Marty against the wall, but Marty swings aside. When Marty tries to sneak in, Biff punches him. They're now on the wrong side of the road, but Biff swings back and dodges a passing truck. Marty grabs the almanac and jumps down, and Biff turns around. Biff revs the engine and Marty tries to fly away on the hoverboard. As Biff races towards Marty, it's doubtful that Marty will reach the end of the tunnel before Biff reaches him. Marty reaches the end of the tunnel in time and grabs a streamer that Doc has lowered from the DeLorean, lifting him clear of the tunnel. Biff, racing at full speed, looks up, shocked. Just as his eyes return to the road, he sees a manure truck stopped in the road. Biff slams on the brakes, but it's too late, and he plows into the back of the truck, which dumps its entire load into the car again. He screams, \"Manure! I hate manure!\" Doc and Marty return to the billboard, just as a thunderstorm rolls in. Doc lowers Marty to the ground on his hoverboard. A storm is creating turbulence, so Doc has to come around from another direction to land. Doc asks Marty about the almanac, and tells him to burn it. Marty puts it into a bucket and burns it with matches from Biff's casino. When he does so, the words on the change from \"(Biff's) Pleasure Paradise\" to \"Auto Detailing\". The newspaper headline changes from \"GEORGE MCFLY MURDERED\" to \"GEORGE MCFLY HONORED\". Marty calls Doc, telling him that the newspaper changed and his father is still alive. Doc sees another newspaper headline change from \"EMMETT BROWN COMMITTED\" to \"EMMETT BROWN COMMENDED\", and says, \"Mission accomplished.\" Marty asks Doc if everything is back to normal, if Jennifer and Einstein are okay. Doc says yes, it's the ripple effect, and that they can go back to their own future. A lightning bolt strikes a tree across the street from Marty, and he ducks. Doc quips he (Doc) almost bought the farm. Seconds later, another lightning bolt strikes the DeLorean, and it vanishes in a puff of smoke. Marty tries unsuccessfully to call Doc on the radio, but it is useless. The streamer drops to the ground, the end smoking. As the rain begins pouring down, and moments later, a car pulls up. A man gets out of the car and informs Marty that he is from Western Union, and they have been holding a certain letter for the last 70 years, with instructions to deliver it to Marty at this exact place and time. The man lost a bet whether or not Marty would be there. Marty signs for the folder; opening it to find a letter from Doc. He reads the letter aloud as the man listens. Doc says that he's alive and well. Marty reads that Doc is alive in the year 1885, in the Old West. The man asks Marty if he needs any help. Marty replies that there's only one man who can help him, and runs away. Doc's counterpart has just finished helping Marty's counterpart return to 1985, and is running down the street laughing. Marty runs to him and grabs him from behind. Doc is shocked, saying that he just sent Marty back to the future. Marty says that he's back from the future, and Doc faints. Marty tries to revive Doc. The movie ends with a title card reading \"TO BE CONCLUDED...\" and previews of Back to the Future Part III.",

         "As a huge BTTF fan, I have to admit that this is the best BTTF flick ever made. It has all the ingredients to please all audience of any age. I personally like the 50's stuff in it, but I am also a huge 80's fan (the present in the movie) and the future is just hilarious. Of course...it has been almost two decades since this movie came out, and now we know that the future that is shown in BTTF 2 is a bit funny, but hey...do you remember Total Recall? Now THAT is also a future that would never see daylight, but at least the BTTF 2 future is amusing. I have seen this movie over a dozen times, and I tried to find things that don't match, movie mistakes etc. (yes..I am a pain in the ..)but the thing is, I KNOW that there are mistakes (like reflections in window glass) but this movie keeps your mind drifting away, enchanted by the great story and great moments. Of course Spielberg never intended to have more ingredients then the past (50's), the present and the future. But almost 20 years later...it is also a (another) great movie to see what the 80's were all about. (so another great moment for people of my age, born in the late 70's) I recommend this movie to ANYONE, but watch BTTF(the first movie) first, because you can't watch part 2 or 3 without watching it in the right sequence. Have fun! (I recommend the trilogy box, you can purchase it anywhere)",
         "When Back to The Future was initially conceived, director and writer Robert Zemeckis and writer Bob Gale had no idea how much notoriety it would eventually achieve, nor of the big box office records it would break. They were happy just to see their project come to fruition. When they wrote the original film, the ending they had written was supposed to be the end of it. Because of it's success, however, and Hollywood being Hollywood, there had to be the inevitable sequels. The problem was that with the original ending, they had painted themselves into a corner as to where they could go with the sequel. What they finally came up with in Part II, is a film that is every bit as whimsical as the original, yet moves along at a pace that will leave you breathless. For part II the cast is pretty much intact from the original film. The exceptions are Crispin Glover as George McFly has been replaced by Jeffrey Weisman and Claudia Wells has been replaced by Elizabeth Shue as Marty's girlfriend Jennifer. George McFly's role in the sequel is more talked about by other characters than his actual on screen time, and Jennifer's time on screen is quick and brief also (although she has one great scene that takes place in the future)so neither casting change is of any consequence. The original film dealt with how Marty had threatened his own existence because of changes he had accidentally initiated in the year 1955. For Part II, we learn what happens when the interference is of a much larger scale and consequence. As you recall, the original film ended with Doc Brown(Christopher Lloyd)whisking Marty (Michael J. Fox)and Jennifer away with him to the year 2015 to straighten out their kids. For all his harping about messing with historical events, Doc is not above initiating a bit of interference himself. In their attempt to rescue Marty's future offspring, an aged but still obnoxious Biff Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson), steals the Delorean to transport himself into the past and to bestow upon himself a Sports Almanac book that contains the results of sporting events for years to come. Shortly thereafter, Doc and Marty return to 1985, only to find that not only is Hill Valley not what it used to be, their own lives are in pretty sad shape and far different than what they had been before. And the changes aren't good ones, or as Doc puts it \"I can't imagine Hell being much worse.\" What makes the Back To The Future series so terrific, is that Zemeckis and Gale took the time travel concept, applied a little originality to it, then let their imaginations run wild. In BTTFII, we get a story that moves along like a runaway freight train. Not content to give us what the year 2015 may be truly like, since making such predictions are usually wrong anyway, they decide to let it all hang loose and just have fun with it. There are holographic theaters, Cafe 80's shops, antique stores that sell dustbusters and other things, skateboards that hover, paying for cab rides with thumbprints, etc. etc. Yet, for all the glossy, multi-colored stores and goofy concepts, we still recognize it as the same old Hill Valley. Something else Zemeckis and Gale do is to take some events from the first film, and replay them in 2015 Hill Valley. Usually, things like this would be seen as the lack of an idea, but in this case its simply Zemeckis having a little fun and letting us in on it. It works perfectly. Likewise, the alternative version of 1985 Hill Valley is an exercise in how far one's imagination can go. Instead of a quaint peaceful town and suburbs, Zemeckis and Gale do everything in their power to give us the equivalent of an opposite. To go into too much detail here would undermine your own viewing experience and give away a bit too much of the plot. Then to add fuel to the fire, we once again revisit Hill Valley in 1955, where things really go berserk what with two Marty's and two Docs inhabiting the same year. Zemeckis does a great job of cutting new scenes into footage from the original film with different angles and different perspectives of previous seen activities. As for the cast, Fox and Lloyd keep their characters of Marty and Doc on the same entertaining level as before. Fox is also given the chore of playing his nerdy son of the future, Marty as a middle aged man and even his daughter of the future. He is pretty much successful except I do think playing his daughter was a bit much. Lea Thompson, again has the difficult chore of bringing Lorraine Mcfly to us in three different characterizations, and as before handles it admirably. Her 1955 Lorraine will always be her most memorable characterization in these films, but the others are equally well done. As for Thomas F. Wilson as Biff, Biff is biff, no matter how old, how young, or how powerful he may be, and his consistence of performance is also noteworthy. Some have complained about being able to follow Zemeckis and Gale's storyline. If you have seen the first film, you'll have no trouble in that regard. I sure didn't, and for me it was one heck of a comedic thrill ride from beginning to end. If you don't have fun watching Back To The Part II, then the only thing I can think of is that your as much of a curmudgeon as old Biff from 2015. It's not often that a sequel can live up to it's predecessor, but when it does, and introduces some originality along the way you get my grade, which for Back To The Future is an A.",
         "Marty McFly is back, and this time he has to travel back to 1955 after an unfortunate incident which took place in 2015 so that he can prevent the destruction of the peaceful society of Hill Valley (what a great fictional name!). The film provides two hours of absolutely wonderful and fun entertainment. Every paradox and logical problem of time-travel is explained very well in the film itself, and those that are left out are easily overlooked due to the creativeness of the rest of the film. Who cares that if Marty leaves 1985 in a time machine to 2015, there would be no Marty left in 1985 to grow to up into the 47 year old Marty in 2015? This movie is so much fun that things like this are gladly forgotten about in order to accept the huge amount of satisfaction delivered by the film. The Back To The Future trilogy is a perfect example of the need to be willing to abandon at least a tiny bit of logic in order to fully enjoy a movie. This suspension of disbelief is necessary for a person to be able to truly experience the effectiveness of all three Back To The Future films, and this experience truly is a great one. It is so rare that a film or a series of films comes along that is so well written and perfectly acted and directed as the Back To The Future movies are. Although I realize that another sequel would probably be disastrous to the credibility of the series as a whole, I have to admit that I have always been disappointed that they stopped at the third film. All three are so much fun that they leave you wishing that the story left room for a few more sequels.",
         "It's funny that the plot of 'Back to the Future II' should be based on altering Marty McFly's future. Wasn't Doc the one who was so staunchly opposed to knowing too much about their future, preferring instead to let things take a natural course? 'Destiny!' he called it. But that is exactly what the sequel is all about, Doc's proposal to altar the future. And this leads not only to bad news for Doc Brown and Marty, but for the your Density? I mean, Destiny? (flashback humor). The story focuses on Marty McFly's future. Picking up right where we left off in the first movie, Doc informs Marty that in the year 2015, Marty's son partakes in some unfortunate activities with Griff (Biff's grandson) that lead to his arrest and incarceration. While in the future to fix up that little mishap (again, messing with 'Destiny'), Marty picks up a sports Almanac to take back with him. The Almanac contains all sports scores since something like 1955 (why it is only the size of a magazine, I don't know, considering it covers major college and pro sporting event for a whole lot of years). The Doc, in disgust at Marty's foolish get-rich-quick desires, throws the magazine out (while still in 2015). Unfortunately, Biff, now an old man, gets hold of both the magazine and the Delorian and travels to his young self in 1955. This sets off a change of events in the past so that when Marty and the Doc, now in the future, are ready to go back to 1985, suddenly find themselves in an unfamiliar hell. With Biff changing the past, he also changed the future, creating a desolate, alternate 1985. One where Biff is the richest man in Hill Valley, though still the sleaziest. And where a lot of other things have changed as well. Now, Marty and the Doc have to go back to 1955 and get the magazine from Biff if they expect to restore the future and erase the alternative 1985. This is a great sequel to a great movie. You get the 1989 version of the future (I don't know that 2015 will make the kind of progress we see in the movie with cool flying cars and dehydrating pizzas and hoverboards). This is the special effects and visual beauty of the second, whereas in the first one, it was recreating the past. Marty had to once adapt to 1955, now he has to do the same for 2015, even if only for a moment. But, it also ties in another creative aspect: when Marty and the Doc must return to 1955, they only know the whereabouts of Biff based on where they last saw him in that year--the school dance and all of that which took place in the first movie. Going back to that past means that a Marty \"Calvin Klein\" McFly is already there, and the events are taking place again just as we saw them in the first movie. And now, the Marty and the Doc from the future are intermingling once again with their past versions of themselves. So, in essence, the filmmakers had to recreate some of the scenes from the old movie, from different angles, and the actors had to play dual roles (which they do often throughout the trilogy) by being added into those scenes. It was a great special effects/visionary project to undertake, and what makes the series so damned creative and really a fun idea. And here, too, the goal is to avoid running into your past self because, yes, it could altar events once again. I wonder how the future changed since Marty and Doc's intervention in 2015? So, prepare yourself for what may arguably be the best movie out of the trilogy (probably because you get to see the future and past and everything in between; although, I'm still torn between rating the first or the second as my absolute favorite). It is the continuation of a fun first movie, and keeps up the creativity and novelty. I think that was the reason most responsible for its success: the ability to keep offering something new (although some things, are obviously repeated, like the running gag of Marty blacking out and waking up to some version of his mother informing him of what year it is after he tells her what an awful dream he had). So, sit back and let the Delorean be your guide.",
         "Back to the Future Part II (1989) was green lighted after the success of the first film. The film follows the further adventures of Marty and Doc Brown. This film and the third installment were filmed back to back. However the complexity of the storyline turned off many of the fans of the original. But this is what I enjoyed about this movie. Instead of being the same old run-of-the-mill by the numbers sequel, the film makers decided to do something different and make this a brain twister film. The beauty of this movie is that you have to pay close attention to it. The film takes place right after the events of part one. Doc Brown comes back from the future to help Marty get his kid out of trouble. Instead of leaving well enough alone, all three of them head off to the future to try and change events. They managed to pull it off but unfortunately they tore a fabric in time due to Marty being greedy and the nosy efforts of Doc Brown. Can Doc and Marty safely restore the space and time continuum before the universe collapses upon itself? A fun sequel with a few cast changes (Elizabeth Shue now portrays Marty's girlfriend whilst Crispin Glover is no longer with in the film except in stock footage). Most of the original players return to reprise their original roles. Michael J. Fox stretches his acting abilities by playing his son and daughter as well as his older self. If you enjoyed the first film then you'll really want to watch this one (if you haven't already). Highly recommended.",
         "I'm one lucky girl, I rented all three Back to the Future films, so I could watch them all in a row, I didn't have to wait year after year, well I was kinda born in 1985, so it's all good. But anyways, I just saw the Back to the Future trilogy tonite and after it seeming like I was the only person who didn't see these movies, I did it! Part two was a very good sequel, while it isn't quite up to par with the first Back to the Future, it was cool, it was kinda like Deja Vu with a different story that worked. Marty and Jennifer start off where the first left off, Doc takes them to the year 2015(which is funny that it is only 8 years away), and Doc tells Marty to fix a situation with his future son. Biff overhears an idea later brought up to Doc about possibly giving himself tips to win big money for the future as soon as they go back, but Doc talks him out of it, but Biff has different plans and takes the book and the De Lauren and goes back to 1955 and makes himself the richest man alive in 1985, so Marty and The Doc must go back and alter the future back to it's old ways. Part two is definitely worth a look for those Back to the Future fans, not to mention, it's just good to see where these stories go. Like I said, it's not as good as the first, but it is a good movie and actually a little better than a 7.1, if you ask me. But that's just me, so just give this movie a chance, you just might find yourself enjoying it. 9/10",
         "Marty (Michael J Fox) is glad to be back to 1985. A much better 1985 with a much happier family, because back in 1955 something good happens and that changes the future. While he's about to relax with his girlfriend, Jennifer (Elisabeth Shue), Doc Emmet Brown (Christopher Lloyd) comes back from 2015 with his DeLorean time machine and asks Marty to go back to the future to save his children. While doing their job, Marty buys a sports almanac of the 20th century and unfortunately, when Doc seriously asks him to throw it away, Biff (Thomas F Wilson), a long-time nemesis, overhears their conversation, takes the book from the waste bin, steals the time machine and gives the almanac to his younger self back in 1955. When Doc and Marty get back to 1985, they realise that things have changed. Hill Valley has turned into hell, governed by the wealthy, powerful and devilish Biff Tannen. Marty's father has long been dead and his mother is married to Biff. What went wrong? Finally Doc and Marty find out that they must revisit 1955 and get things right... This fascinating sequel has some fun and some dark sides in it. The skate boarding scene is just brilliant. What a deja vu. The 2015 presented in the film is quite interesting (I wonder if 2015 will look just like that) and we get to watch once again Marty playing 'Johnny B Goode' and his father punching Biff. In the end, after getting back in 1985, Marty unintentionally changes his own future for better again. Most sequels are pathetic, but this one is different. It succeeds in exciting the audience. The whole cast did a good job, Michael J Fox is great fun playing several characters at the same time. Along with the original and 'Back to the Future Part III', this is for certain one of the best time travel flicks. Not to be missed!",
         "I love the original movie, so don't get me wrong, but I have a special thing for really cool looking futuristic things. Especially if they're made out to look really interesting like in this sequel. The story is still very good, the characters are still lovable and have some great lines, and the ending is superb even if it leaves you wanting for a little more. Interchanging between this movie and the last (even the next) were great twists and turns, probably still the best achievement i've seen properly executed in a film to date. While the original is probably an eleven on my scale now, this one used to be my all time favorite one in the BTTF trilogy. And there's still a whole lot to love about this movie, even the kids today will probably appreciate how much fun this movie is even with all the flash and more advanced CG effects they have in their movies today.",
         "'Back to the Future Part II' takes off where the first movie left. Pretty much the essence of the first one is present except this time Elisabeth Shue has been cast as Marty's girlfriend. Like the first movie, this one too is non-stop fun. The original plot once again, brilliantly revolves around the time-travelling paradox but this time the interference with the time-line has huger repercussions that are more complicated to solve. It's slightly a little more complex than the first movie but the energy and entertainment level is the same. I liked Zemeckis's version of 2015. It has that ultracool look and the futuristic gadgets and gizmos were quite amusing. The soundtrack is equally wild. The camera-work and special effects are very well done considering that the challenge was greater (e.g. showing two Michael J. Fox on the same screen). Okay, so showing the same actor share the screen with himself isn't anything new but in most movies/shows it looks poorly done which is not the case here. With most movies, the sequel tends to be a let down but 'Back to the Future Part II' is a great continuation of the first film.",
         "Continuing a movie as perfect as \"Back To The Future\" must have been a really tough job. What made it even harder was that the writers Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale had to ignore an important character from part one. Because Crispin Glover asked for too much money, his character George McFly, Marty's wacky Dad, hardly appears in the sequels, which constricted the storyline a lot beforehand. Still, \"Back To The Future II\" turned out to be a huge success, commercially and artistically. The movie is every bit as clever and delightful as part one. I think most viewers don't realize how extremely complex this story is, because it's so enjoyable to watch. Gale & Zemeckis wrote a screenplay that takes place in three different periods of time, changes storyline more than once, has characters interacting with themselves all the time, but never seems overdone or confusing. The most original trick the two Bobs pulled was to virtually return to part one and have the main character interfere with the original storyline. I don't think that has ever been done before or since. No, the movie isn't flawless in a sense that everything can be explained logically. Bob Gale admitted himself that Marty and Doc shouldn't be able to visit their future selves in the first place. There are a lot of impossible time travels in part two (you can read about them in detail here: http://mjyoung.net/time/back2.html). \"Mistakes\" like that don't take away any of the fun, though, and I still think that the \"Back To The Future\" trilogy incorporates the logics of time traveling better than any other movie ever did. Besides the perfect script the trilogy's success is due to Zemeckis ever so beautiful direction and his eye for detail, and of course the great cast. Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Thomas F. Wilson and Lea Thompson, all shamelessly underrated actors, are once again brilliant. It's a REAL pity that Crispin Glover didn't return for the sequels, but as I've said before, Gale & Zemeckis did a great job writing their way around his memorable character. The only other actress that didn't come back was Claudia Wells, who played Jennifer in part one and was appropriately replaced by Elisabeth Shue here. Summing up, \"Back To The Future II\" is a more than worthy follow-up to one of the best movies of all time. In fact, I think it's the best sequel ever made, only rivaled by \"Terminator 2: Judgement Day\". But that's a different story..."
