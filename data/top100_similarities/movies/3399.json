      "synopsis": "The film begins with a group of birds that are part of an organization called 'The Feathered Friends.' Their topic of the day: Big Bird. The organization feels that Big Bird should be placed with a family of birds, seeing as he appears to be an orphan. The organization approves for it's representative Miss Finch to help Big Bird. Miss Finch arrives on Sesame Street, and soon convinces Big Bird that he should be with a bird family. The announcement comes as a sad goodbye to Big Bird's friends, who consider themselves his family. Soon afterwards, Big Bird arrives in Ocean View, Illinois, where he is introduced to his new family: The Do-Do's. Big Bird tries to get along with his new family, but he still feels homesick. One day, a large postcard arrives from Mr Snuffleupagus, wanting to visit. The Do-Do's laugh at the notion that Big Bird has friends that are not birds. Their words upset Big Bird, who then decides to run away back to Sesame Street. Big Bird's friends hear of his 'flight' on TV, as well as a statement by Miss Finch who vows to find Big Bird and return him to the Do-Do's. The next day, Big Bird's friends take action, setting out by car and plane to find him. Along the way, Big Bird soon tires of walking, and hitches a ride with a turkey farmer. After some time, Big Bird ends up on a farm, where he befriends two children. After spending the night in their barn, he helps them with their chores the next day. However, Big Bird flees when Miss Finch is seen nearby. Eventually, Big Bird makes his way to a city called Toadstool. But Miss Finch is not too far behind, and Big Bird has to flee once again. On the outskirts of Toadstool, Big Bird meets a pair of no-goods called The Sleaze Brothers. Offering to hide Big Bird from Miss Finch, Big Bird soon realizes he is trapped when the brothers refuse to let him go. Smelling a lucrative deal on their hands, the brothers paint Big Bird blue, and tout him as 'The Bluebird of Happiness.' However, Big Bird's stage song is one of sadness, in which he sings of being home with his friends. After the show, two children meet him backstage, where he explains for them to call Sesame Street, and tell them where he is. The next day, Big Bird's friends sneak into the circus tent to free him. However, the Sleaze Brothers take off before they can rescue him. Gordon and Olivia give chase, and help release Big Bird, before the two Sleaze Brothers are pulled over and charged with a long string of illegal practices and felonies. Soon afterwards, Big Bird returns to Sesame Street amid cheers from his friends, but soon grows worried when Miss Finch shows up, promising to try and place him with another 'bird family.' Maria strongly rebuffs Miss Finch's decision, claiming that on Sesame Street, there are all kinds of people and things, and they are all happy together, even if they aren't all the same. After hearing Maria's testimony, and realizing how far his friends went to get him back, Miss Finch declares that Big Bird can stay. Now home where he belongs, Big Bird returns to his nest, where he greets Mr. Snuffleupagus, who had been waiting for his return.",

         "This is a wonderful film for children ages 8 and under. Parents of children that age will be very grateful for a childrens film which has zero bathroom humor or any other crudity. Now I am no prude, but in a day and age when young children are treated to scenes of wart hogs with gas (Lion King) or the sight of a dog hiking it's leg to relieve itself with a commentary(Homeward Bound), it is just nice to have something completely harmless for the little ones. I had to comment because this film deserved more than just to have a listing of: In Memory of Waylon Jennings. This film is a credit to the wonderful creativity of people like Jim Henson, who put quality children programs ahead of the easier, poorly made childrens fare. Michael",
         "This was the very first movie I ever saw at a theater. I was six years old and my grandma took me to see it. We both loved it. My memories are kind of fuzzy, as I haven't seen Follow That Bird since. But I remember being really sad because Big Bird was separated from his loved ones at Sesame Street. And I remember the gang trying to find him. And I remember, when the movie was over, how happy I was and how much fun I had.",
         "stars: Dave Thomas and Joe Flaherty. cameos: Waylon Jennings, Chevy Chase, Sandra Bernhard, John Candy and others. Muppeteers: Carol Spinney as Big Bird and Oscar. Frank Oz as Bert, Grover and Cookie Monster. Jim Henson as Ernie and Kermit the frog. Martin P. Robinson as Telly and Snuffolupogous. Jerry Nelson as the Count. Richard Hunt as Gladys, Sully, Elmo and others. Great movie! It's about a group of birds deciding that Big Bird is lonely and relocating him with an adopted Bird family. Because he doesn't like the family, he runs away. Kermit the frog comes on the news telling everyone and Maria, Gordon, Oscar, The Count, Telly, Grover, Cookie Monster, Ernie, Bert and many others go searching for him by car, by helicopter and by flying(Super Grover). Great family fun for everyone. Even though it is based on an educational TV show, there isn't any numbers or learning here. It's got some really fun and funny moments and will has a sentimental value in my heart! rated G. 84 mins. my rating-A minus.",
         "I've had this movie ever since I was a little girl and I remember someone asking me, \"Why do you still have a Sesame Street movie in your video collection?\" I tell them one, because it has a wonderful storyline attached to it; two, because it features the world-famous Jim Henson's Muppets and three, I don't mind my children watching it with me. Come to think of it, I wouldn't even be embarrassed if my children saw me watching it all by myself. It's that kind of movie, I loved it then and I still love it today. You have to give Sesame Street credit, it's the longest running children's show on television, it's audience has grown to more than 1 million viewers, many were children when the show began in 1969 and are now introducing it to their children. You can take Barney and Thomas the Tank Engine, Teletubbies or even the Wiggles but give me Big Bird and Kermit the Frog any day.",
         "\"Follow That Bird\" attempts to take a show written for pre-schoolers and present it to a larger audience. Not only that, they attempt to create a film that is both entertaining and enlightening. For this reviewer, they succeed magnificently. There are many \"in-jokes,\" so to speak, in this movie -- anyone who has ever watched the show will laugh whenever one of the characters asks, \"Can you tell me how to get to Sesame Street?\" and the normal audience of Sesame Street will still be amused by their favorite characters, while learning something about friendship and the meaning of family. Sesame Street, the TV show, was rather daring in that it showed black, white, green, purple, furry, and ... other ... living in perfect harmony. Except for Oscar the Grouch! And, speaking of Oscar, one of the many funny bits (this movie is packed with them, and all of the humor is safe for family viewing) is the Grouch diner. Look for Sandra Bernhard as a Grouch waitress. The cameos in this film are something else; Chevy Chase, John Candy, Sandra Bernhard, even Waylon Jennings, all devoted some of their time and talent to making this roundly enjoyable movie. And listen for the voice of Sally Kellerman as Miss Finch, the social worker from the Feathered Friends Society. Not that all of this movie is funny and light-hearted. There's a few sad moments with Big Bird -- I always get choked up during the \"One Shining Star\" song, which features a three-part counterpoint with Bird, Mr. Snuffleupagus, and Olivia all singing about Big Bird being safe back at home. And the Sleaze Brothers' scenes are thinly disguised cartoon villainry. I don't know if any of the Sesame Street characters have SEEN villains before -- Oscar is the closest they have, but he's just Grouchy. He doesn't actually hurt anyone, and the Sleaze Brothers start out nice and friendly to Big Bird. We learn quite a bit during this movie -- we learn that we should never order tossed salad in a Grouch restaurant, for example. We learn that it's never ok to jump from a moving vehicle -- unless we have Gordon's permission. And we learn our real home is where the people love and care about us. But, perhaps the most important lesson is that there are 258 fabulous credits! Hahahahahaha! (thunder and lightning sound here) And, from the filmmakers we learn that you CAN make a family film that includes the entire family (how many times have \"family films\" been suitable only for those family members still in diapers?) and refuses to preach? One of the many strengths of the Sesame Street characters is their ability to teach a lesson without shoving it down our throats. We never feel threatened or annoyed by these characters; we're always safe and welcome on Sesame Street.",
         "It took me about 28 years before I finally got around to seeing Follow That Bird and I kind of feel guilty about it. Like many kids, I watched Sesame Street in its prime circa. 1974-82, although I liked The Electric Company more. I grew up watching these actors and Muppets. By 1985, I was too old for Sesame Street and would only watch it while waiting for my younger brothers to finish watching it so I could change the channel to watch music videos. I had a chance to rent it on VHS in 1988 but never did. After awhile, I forgot about the film altogether. Finally, I watched the film a few weeks ago and I realized I missed seeing a joyful movie that is free of the condescending tone and shilling that today's kids fare provides. Big Bird (voiced by Caroll Spinney) is forced to leave Sesame Street by some social welfare group for birds led by Miss Finch (voiced by Sally Kellerman) because they feel children-aged birds would be better off having adult birds and a bird family raising him than the more-than-capable human adults he has for his neighbors. After leaving for Oceanview, Illinois and unhappy with the Dodo family, he decides naively to walk back to NYC and when his friends back home get the Amber alert on the news from Chevy Chase, they all form several groups to intercept him. Unfortunately, the Sleaze Brothers (SCTV's Joe Flaherty and Dave Thomas) also hear the news and see Big Bird as their ticket to $$$. They are able to capture him and it's up to his old friends to free him. What I loved about the movie is that there's no talking down or condescending treatment of the audience. It's just a great children's film that teaches the importance of friendship and devotion to said friends. The actors don't try to change their personas. Maria, Gordon, Bob, Cookie Monster, Grover, etc. are the same people we saw in the T.V. show. The music, sadly, isn't very good but \"I'm So Blue\", sung when Big Bird is captured by the Sleaze Brothers is an exception. When a painted blue Big Bird sings his sad song, you feel empathy for the guy. I doubt if Barney was painted yellow, anybody would show him the same treatment. It would be seen as the greatest comedy scene in Hollywood instead. While the movie is G-rated, adults will see some spoofs from various movies; subtle as they are. The opening song featuring Oscar The Grouch in front of a U.S. flag reminded me of Patton while the food fight featuring Sandra Bernhard (!) gave me flashbacks to Blazing Saddles. It's too bad the film faired poorly in the box office despite critical acclaim. If you can find a way to see this film and your kids aren't Elmo fanatics (he was nothing in 1985) they will enjoy it immensely. You can only then hope we'll revert to more of Follow That Bird and less of, say, Twilight.",
         "The gang from \"Sesame Street\" hit the big screen and they hit a bull's-eye. The story is simple: Big Bird is taken away from his warm nest on SS and taken to live with a ditsy foster family of dodo birds. Homesick and lonely, he sets off on a journey back home while being pursued by his friends, social workers and carnival owners. This movie is pretty much perfect, in it's own way. The all-star cast (a Muppet tradition) just shine and deliver sweet and likable performances with Dave Thomas and Joe Flaherty stand-outs as the bumbling villains. Carroll Spinney also delivers a heart-warming performance as Big Bird. In fact, there's not a dent in sight when it comes to this collection of actors. The story might be simple but would you have it any other way? When comparing this to the sequel, \"Elmo in Grouchland\", this comes off like \"Die Hard\" which I consider an amusing comparison. My only real complaint is the forgettable songs. Overall for the kids and young at heart, this is a joy.",
         "In the spirit and tradition of Bob Hope and Bing Crosby, Sesame Street makes a road trip movie for kids to watch. At a time when things were good in America and Sesame Street was a top rated children's show, Jim Henson took his characters from the television screen to theater screens. A time when Big Bird is not sure that Sesame Street is the right place for him, a six and a half foot yellow bird. Who would have thought? Ken Kwapis directs this beautifully done film with great landscapes and cinematography to boost. Back when this film was made, Henson was still alive and performing with the muppeteers, along with old friend Frank Oz. All the main Sesame Street characters on the show at the time were cast into this film, which enriches its wonderlust for children of all ages. After all these years, \"Follow That Bird\" is still loads of fun to watch. Considering that this is a children's movie (we're all children at heart), I give this film an 8.",
         "Follow That Bird is a five star event that has spectacular music. In my opinion Follow That Bird is a movie the whole family will enjoy. My favorite part is when the Muppet patrons order tossed salad and the Muppet Grouch cook gives them what they ordered via slingshot. Big Bird of Sesame Street is much smarter than the DoDo family of Canary Road. Like their name the Dodos behave extremely ridiculous and Big Bird would rather return to his familiar surroundings Sesame Street. Sandra Berhnard played a Grouch waitress and John Candy played the state trooper both were excellent. The movie was filmed in Canada. The scenery was peaceful rural farmland with fields of corn. Other notable characters, Sally Kellerman sweet voice suited Miss finch. Buy the movie you will love it!",
         "The bird adoption agency comes across the case of Big Bird - who lives alone with no other birds around him. Working for the agency, Miss Finch convinces Bird to leave Sesame Street and move across America to live with the Dodo Family. When Bird misses his friends he leaves his new home to walk back home - not aware of how far it is. On his journey he meets many people, but several groups are out looking for him too - including all his friends from Sesame Street, a pair of circus owners and none other than Miss Finch herself. Sesame Street is the benchmark for children's television forever as far as I'm concerned - educational and entertaining, it did such a good job that it took me years of school before I stopped pronouncing Z `zee' and did it properly as `zed'. This film version turns off the straight educational part of the service but ups the entertainment. The plot is a good excuse for a freewheeling adventure that has plenty of laughs. Big Bird's sections are a little slower, truth be told, but the supporting searches are very light and funny - Bird has to carry the message so it's fair it should be less funny. The message takes over the educational stuff and is a nicely put one about accepting differences and still being friends. It isn't heavily made until the end, where the `with your own kind' argument is hammered home. This is a little heavy handed but can be forgiven due to the level of enjoyment the film gives. While not aiming at adults per se, the film has plenty for them - the humour never aims low but should be enjoyed by adults and children alike. The funniest `adult' laugh is accidental and is where Maria turns to Sandra Bernhard and says `I'd like a tossed salad'! Unintentional laugh of course as the `other' meaning of that wasn't really known in the early 80's! Sorry - I'm just twisted! Outside of that the biggest laugh I had that kids won't get was the homage to North By Northwest's crop duster scene. The cast is great. All the old Muppets from the street are here, although it may upset young fans to see Elmo sidelined to a silent appearance at a window but the rest are good stuff. Bird himself is a little dry but the rest are very funny in small amounts - Grover, Count, Cookie Monster and Oscar all had good lines, as did Ernie & Bert, but Telly is kind of the Muppet nobody really likes! The human cast of Sesame Street are cheerful and light - as you would expect, but it is the good cameos that spice it up. Chase has a great moment, Kermit reprises his reporter role but is clearly too big for this movie, Kellerman, Candy and Flaherty all have very small roles, although Flaherty has the best song. Overall this is a very enjoyable movie that is perfectly pitched for adults and children - without doing what Pixar do and separating the material for each taste. The songs are not that great and there is at least one poor one in there, but the film has a fun energy to it that is wholesome but still entertaining and has great dialogue from start to finish. Love it!"
