         "content": "> Twins and their failures, depression, suicide attempt, together overcoming.\r\n\r\nAfter the beautiful 'Hateship Loveship', I expected this one for Kristen Wiig. It was a brother-sister relationship theme. The main characters are twins and they have lots of common. The story begins when they meet for the first time after the ten years of no connection. The circumstance was strange as they both were depressed who attempt for a self kill. That does not end successfully, instead narration commence for us where they share each others memory of the past by trying to shape up the present life. But still the old habits won't let them alone as they encounter life changing decisions by the end of the story.\r\n\r\nKind of a rare movie, all about the twins' bonding told in a humourous way, mostly. Mistakes are the essence of the script. The fall and rise were cleverly constructed throughout around those two characters. The cast was the plus point. Since it was about twins, Wiig and Hader are perfectly fit for their respective roles. As for Bill Hader, I've never seen he donned in a higher ranked role like this. He was always been a co-star and in this film he's one of the leads. Everybody gets their time right like awesome Timothy Spall in 'Mr. Turner'.\r\n\r\nIn this movie, these two lead performers were absolutely spot on. But the lack of pace is a challenge. If you pass through it successfully, you would get a nice entertainment. If not, the movie would be dull, pale, even it could be worse film of the year for you. Anyway, still it falls short to be an excellent film, I consider it to be a just good movie. Worth a watch, but the movie won't stay in your memory for so long.\r\n\r\n6.5/10",

      "synopsis": "We begin with a flashback of twins Maggie and Milo as children dressing up for Halloween with their dad. Maggie tells us that maybe they got their problems from their dad. Everyone refers to her and Milo as the \"Gruesome Twosome.\" In the present, Milo (Bill Hader) is blasting music in his apartment. He draws a face on his bathroom mirror, then lays in the tub. Off camera he slits his wrists. The water in the tub gets bloody. Maggie (Kristin Wiig) is at home in her bathroom holding a handful of pills. Her phone rings. Her ring tone is the Growing Pains theme song 'As Long as We Got Each Other'. Maggie goes to the hospital and visits her brother. Its been ten years since they've seen each other. A nurse gives her his suicide note. It read, 'To whom it may concern. See ya later'. She suggests he go back to New York with her. He resists because he thinks she's only making the offer out of guilt, plus he has fat goldfish to take care of. She says he can get new goldfish. The go to New York and Milo meets Maggie's husband Lance (Luke Wilson). He's an odd match for Maggie, but is clearly a nice guy. He brags about how Maggie is always trying new things. Currently she's taking scuba lessons for when they have a late honeymoon in Hawaii. The next day, Milo bums around town and finds Rich (Ty Burrell) inside a bookstore. He watches from a distance. Later he goes to a gay bar, but its dyke night. He goes home to Maggie's house drunk and wakes her and Lance up by bursting into their bedroom and telling them about his adventures with the lesbians. The next morning Milo apologizes. Maggie suggests he do some work clearing paths in the woods with Lance. Maggie goes to her scuba lesson. She and the instructor Billy (Boyd Holbrook) clearly have a bit of sexual tension. When she goes home, she finds that Milo has invited their mom (Joanna Gleason) over. Their mom is a bit of a free spirit and missed Maggie's wedding because she was on an insight retreat. In fact, that's why she's in New York. She's at another insight retreat at Woodstock. She invites everyone to visit her at any time. Maggie calls her bluff and we see that their mom is all talk and really has very little interest in spending time with her family. She has a new family with new children now. Maggie secretly takes birth control pills. Maggie says to Milo, \"Can you imagine being married to her? I'd jump off a bridge too.\" The next day Milo works up the courage to speak with Rich. He brings a copy of Moby Dick to the counter. Rich is surprised, but relieved to see that Milo has no animosity towards him. He tells him that he read Moby Dick a long time ago when it was given to him by a good teacher. Maggie ends up at the bar with Billy the scuba instructor. She seems uncomfortable and wants to leave, but instead they end up having sex in the bathroom. The next day, Milo is taking Maggie to work. She asks if he thinks she'd make a good mom. He says that shed be overprotective and uptight. She gets angry and leaves. Milo tells Lance about the conversation. Lance says, Sometimes its like landmines, man. He finds himself stepping on them all the time and he's figured out that all he should do is apologize and they can move on. Milo goes to pick up Maggie from her job at the dentist office and apologizes. He says shed make a great mom and he jokes that his real problem is her morbid obesity. She cleans his teeth and they both get high on the nitrous. Milo shares the fact that he ate pussy awhile ago because the girl looked like a young Debbie Harry. He didnt like it. He tells Maggie she has to share a secret. She confesses that shes been taking birth control pills. Its only partially because she doesn't want to have kids. Its mostly because shes been sleeping with the instructors of every new venture shes been taking. Billy is just the latest one. She says that Lance is too good of a man to be married to a whore. Milo says she isn't a whore. She's a restless housewife with whore like tendencies. Milo is late for a meeting. He says he has to meet with Kevin Clancy. Instead, Milo goes out for drinks with Rich. Rich asks if Milo remembers a little copper whale he gave him a long time ago. Milo not only remembers it, he carries it with him everywhere. Maggie is at home watching Deadliest Catch with Luke. She tells him that she loves him. Rich and Milo are in a car and Rich apologizes for what they did a long time ago. Hes dating a woman now and has a son. His son doesn't know about Milo. They end up spending the night together. Milo lies and says that hes doing much better in Los Angeles than is what the reality is. The reality is that he's a waiter at a tourist restaurant. He tells Rich that he just got an agent and is busy as an actor. Rich asks if Milo would give his agent a screenplay he wrote. Maggie tells Billy what they did the other night was a mistake. They bang again. She goes home and violently carves a pumpkin. Milo sees shes upset and cheers her up by forcing her to lip sync along to Nothings Gonna Stop Us Now. Milo is finally getting the swing of his job. He goes to Rich's place and ends up meeting Rich's son. Rich is furious, so Milo goes out and gets super drunk. He finds himself on a rooftop, drunkenly staggering along the edge. He drops the little copper whale over the side. A cop finds him and takes him home. Milo tells Maggie that when he was a kid there was a bully named Justin Meyer. Their dad told him that Justin was the kind of kid who would peak in high school. Milo imagined going to a reunion and Justin would be fat and bald while Milo would be a famous actor with a wonderful boyfriend. He looked up Justin online. Justin has a nice job, nice wife and a couple of kids. Milo realized that Justin didn't peak in high school. He did. Maggie tries to comfort him by telling him that no one is a famous actor. Milo says that George Clooney is. Maggie tells him that she needs to know that he wont check out on her. He promises to do his best. He later reads Richs script. It's a romantic comedy for someone like Jennifer Aniston in mind. Hes not impressed. Lance is out doing Fantasy Football, so Maggie and Milo get dressed up for Halloween like they did as kids. They do a Cemetery Walk, a thing they haven't done since their dad died. They talk about the weird child psychologists they had as kids and show each other their skeleton tattoos. Then they dance. Milo goes to the bathroom and leaves his phone behind. Maggie sees that Rich calls. She calls Milo on this and points out that Kevin Clancy moved away years ago. Rich was a teacher who molested Milo when Milo was 15 years old. He's lucky he didn't go to jail. Maggie seems to be the one who exposed the truth because she was looking out for her brother. She tells him, I know you blame me. This sucks. I was having such a good night. She goes home and ends up sick on the bathroom floor. Lance suggests that he and Milo have a Dudes Day. Milo points out that Dudes Day has an entirely different meaning to him. They end up going to a climbing wall and then have a couple beers. Lance is scared that its taking so long to have kids and is worried that he might be shooting blanks. Milo says that when they were kids Maggie would hide things like cigarettes around the house. Maybe she's doing the same thing with some sort of medication. Lance says that Maggie would never do a thing like that. Maggie goes to the store to buy a pregnancy test because shes a little late, but changes her mind. She runs into an old classmate who has a terrible kid. They hang out a little bit. Her friend says she isnt surprised that Maggie is married because Maggie always had a lot of boyfriends. Maggie breaks down in tears and runs to the bathroom. While in there, she buys a tampon. She isn't pregnant. Maggie buys some goldfish for Milo and tells Billy that its over, for real this time. She goes home and discovers that Lance has found her birth control pills. She confesses that shes been cheating on him. She goes outside to confront Milo. She yells, You ruined my marriage. He points out, \"If you think that's marriage, you're fucking nuts!\" She says that next time he tries to kill himself he should cut deeper. She goes back inside and finds the goldfish she bought and forgot in the plastic bags have died. She tries putting them in an aquarium, but it doesnt work. She throws the aquarium on the ground. Milo asks Rich if hes gay. Rich says that he can make it work with his girlfriend. He also asks if Milo read his script. Milo says it was great. Maggie leaves Milo a voice-mail that says, \"Dad saw a way out and maybe you did too. See ya later.\" Maggie goes to the pool where she had scuba lessons and waits for everyone to leave. Once its empty, she ties weights to herself and jumps in the pool. Before she drowns, Milo jumps in and saves her. She buys him new fish.",

         "Upstate NY is the setting for this funny and poignant film about a set of twins that split apart but are brought together by near-death experiences. It is difficult to make a movie that can go from laughter to the depths of anguish and remain entertaining or even believable, but \"The Skeleton Twins\" manages it well; but without Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig the degree of difficulty would have increased significantly. Hader plays a gay wannabe actor who is not doing well out in LA and paying his rent by waiting tables; Wiig is his twin who has stayed in the small town where they grew up and she is a dental hygienist. Although the flamboyantly gay \"Stephone\" was a Hader favorite on Saturday Night Live, do not expect a stereotype with Milo: this is a human and not a joke. Wiig's Maggie is a flawed character, and both sibs are scarred by their dreadful childhood. How they eventually come to depend on each other is a thing of beauty. Finally, cheers to Craig Johnson for the way he wrote Luke Wilson's Lance: the straight guy who just wants Maggie to be happy and have his children. Johnson makes him a noble character unlike the buffoon so many in Hollywood would have made of this type. The chemistry between Wiig and Hader is incredible, and Wilson is a joy to behold. This is a must-see.",
         "I went to this film at the Sundance premier based on the cast. Knowing this was a Drama with comedic talent left me hopeful but skeptical that it would not be a fish out of water (watch the film to see why I use that analogy) The movie was great. Kristin Wiig was the star she is. Bill Hader was strong in his first dramatic role and the chemistry between these two successful comedians paid off in spades. I believe Luke Wilson will not get his deserved credit in the film due to the role of the leading players, but he was fabulous. This was a drama highlighting some tough stuff. The talent of these actors and their ability to shift to comic relief was the highlight of the film. Get ready to laugh and cry. It was good.",
         "Laughing at the pain of two siblings who unknowingly attempt to kill themselves at the same time, reunite due to this tragedy after ten years of non-communication. With Kristen Wig in the movie, I was expecting to laugh, but I think the best laughs came from Bill Hader. His role as Milo, A gay actor who's life is know where near what he expected in high school, sets us on a whirlwind of emotions as he tries to cope with being back home after being away for so long. Luke Wilson's supporting role as a the likable husband to Kristen Wig's character also gave me a big chuckle as well. Rounding out the cast is Ty Burrell, best known for his role on Modern Family. It was cool to see him do something out of Type. It was weird laughing at people with such messed up lives but some say this is the secret to great comedy, that it comes from a dark place. The filmmakers were able to show light coming from this darkness and it was well played in a way that made the twin's issues relateable to us. It was a great drama with a lot of comedy in it, A must see.",
         "Always given the bit-part characters in the great Apatow comedies of 6 or 7 years ago, it was a mistake of mine to never take Bill Hadar or Kristen Wiig seriously. Sure, Wiig showed some dramatic weight in Bridesmaids, but that was a light comedy after all. The Skeleton Twins is a lot darker, looking at suicide and failure. Wiig and Hadar's conviction really elevate the material here, especially the latter as her gay brother Milo. Their chemistry is predictably a joy to watch. I just wish I related to it more. I could empathize to a point but I didn't identify with it. It's a little difficult to feel too much sympathy for characters who spend the film feeling sorry for themselves and putting themselves into situations that hurt them. Nevertheless, the consequences the film explores are heartbreaking and authentic, especially the confrontations in its final 20 minutes. It has a lovely visual style to go with the mood with a soft washed out look paired with a great soundtrack, especially a memorable lip syncing scene that whisks you away with it. Perhaps it's too familiar or too irreverent for its own good, but it's certainly a good effort from everyone. 7/10",
         "Greetings again from the darkness. Kristen Wiig, Bill Hader, Ty Burrell and Luke Wilson ... prepare yourself for 90 minutes of side-splitting laughter! OK, well you can prepare all you want, but you should know that while there are some funny moments, this is one of the bleakest films of the year. Bleak as in achingly painful to watch at times due to the emotional pain most every character experiences. Hopefully no one stopped reading after \"side-splitting laughter\" because here is a sampling of thematic elements covered in the film: attempted suicide, suicide of a parent, adultery, sexual abuse of a minor, rampant lying, depression, horrific parenting, drug use, animal cruelty. If Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig of SNL fame don't spring to mind when considering those elements, please keep an open mind. Both are extremely good (and believable) in their roles as twins estranged for a decade, forced back together after a near tragedy. See, after a miserable childhood, their time apart has prevented both from establishing a strong personal relationship with anyone else. Hader plays a self-professed \"gay cliché\", while Wiig is pretending to have the perfect suburban life with her gung-ho, always \"up\", good guy husband (Luke Wilson). The film's best humor is produced in small moments thanks to the connection between Wiig and Hader. It's definitely not in the almost shameful attempts at crowd-pleasing offered in the SNL-ish scenes of lip-synching to Starship, and over-indulging on Nitrous Oxide at the dental office. Real emotional turmoil exists in the scenes between Hader and Ty Burrell, and the unnecessary and inexplicable reunion between Hader, Wiig and their mother (Joanna Gleason). Burrell, known for his outstanding \"Modern Family\" role, is intriguing as a dramatic actor. Looking forward to more of this from him. The script, co-written by director Craig Johnson and Mark Heyman, really does capture some poignant and dramatic moments, and certainly benefits from the extremely talented cast. Just don't expect that side-splitting laughter ... unless you are susceptible to lip-synching and/or nitrous oxide.",
         "Kristen Wiig and Bill Hader are such comedy wunderkinds that a dramatic role sounds like a waste. We can picture Wiig screwing around a room with the pizazz of Carol Burnett, with Hader, alongside her, spitting out wicked lines in a wacky voice. Though The Skeleton Twins has a handful of funny moments, it is first and foremost a gloomy drama; we may all love Wiig and Hader's antics on Saturday Night Live, but they are blessed with some serious acting talent. It's the Double Indemnity to their Ball of Fire, the War and Peace to their Sabrina. Twins Maggie (Wiig) and Milo (Hader) have been estranged for 10 years. They're reacquainted, however, when Maggie receives a call from an unknown number; she is informed that Milo has attempted suicide. In one hand, she holds the phone. In the other is a smattering of pills. It's a coincidence that seems as though God set it up just for them. Maggie immediately invites Milo to stay with her and her picture perfect husband, Lance (Luke Wilson), in their suburban New York home; but just as they begin to reconnect, they are forced to face their innermost demons. Milo has been living in Los Angeles for a decade, desperate to become a famous actor. He's seen little success, his life marred with constant disappointment. Maggie knows that she has married a good man, but she is bored with her comfortable, predictable marriage; she's partaken in several affairs and has purposely destroyed any chances of having a baby, something Lance dreams of. The people in The Skeleton Twins aren't unstable in a melodramatic fashion. They are disappointed with their lives, ready to do something drastic just to inject meaning into their veins. Milo thought he'd be the bullied outsider that could, one day, come to a class reunion and laugh at his balding, middling tormentors. Maggie thought that she could live in domestic bliss and stay within that bliss. But it doesn't happen. The film explores several relationships, going back and forth between Milo and Maggie, Milo and his ex-lover, Rich (Ty Burrell), who destroyed his teenage years, and the siblings and their flighty mother (Joanna Gleason). The conversations glide over and under sheer wit and blood- letting, the characters are written with hundreds of layers. They hit close to home, making us question our own self-confidence and achievements. But it's one of those films in which the biggest successes come from the actors. If they didn't have chemistry, The Skeleton Twins would never work. Yet the emotional bonds (good or bad) between the actors in the film are so instantaneously genuine that there is a fluidity that makes the anguish all the more real. The laughs are quick, but they are consistently overtaken by the somber sequences that follow them. Because, in real life, a joke can be thrown off a roof if you open up an old wound.

         "Make no bones about it, the indie comedy-drama \"The Skeleton Twins\" is a nice little picture about two depressed siblings who reunite after not seeing each other for 10 years, and let's just say that the skeletons soon start coming out of their closets as they reveal much about themselves. The film stars SNL alumnus Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig as Milo and Maggie. Milo is a struggling actor in Los Angeles who unsuccessfully attempts suicide in the film's opening scene. That near death experience brings him to reunite with his estranged sister Maggie who takes Milo to her hometown New York, so he could be in a New York state of mind. Anyways, Maggie is no bright chip of the old block either. She is unhappy in her marriage with a caring, devoted husband. She cheats on her husband and is taking birth control pills behind her husband's back. Maggie is one skeleton twin that is bad to the bone. The performances from Hader and Wiig were outstanding, and it was what brought the film to life. I also thought Luke Wilson was brilliant as Maggie's husband Lance. However, I was not too enamored with Craig Johnson's direction and screenplay of the movie. Too me it was a bit uneven and it might have needed some bare bones exuberance to the filmmaking of \"The Skeleton Twins\". But I am still recommending this movie as a solid viewing, and no joints are even required to get a semi-cinematic high watching \"The Skeleton Twins\". *** Average",
         "\"The Skeleton Twins\" has so much raw material to work with that it's nearly tragic it didn't turn out to be a better movie. Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig have a tremendous amount of chemistry as dysfunctional brother and sister who are brought back together by his attempted suicide after years of being estranged. The point of the movie -- which I only know because it was told to me by the film, not because it actually does a good job of conveying it -- is that these two siblings, contentious though they may be, are the best thing for each other, and that their lives are better when they're together than either's is for them when they are not. I'll have to take the movie's word for it, because Hader and Wiig create such messed up characters that it's utterly inconceivable they could possibly help one another until they've helped themselves. I think we're supposed to think they're likable underneath their gloomy angst, mostly because they burst into spontaneous lip synch performances of 80s movie ballads, but they sure as hell aren't any fun to spend time with. The film drags on and on, giving these two talented comedians virtually no opportunities to be remotely funny, and then forces a completely implausible ending on us that we're supposed to accept as evidence that this particular brother and sister can't live without each other. The character I identified most with was the one played by Luke Wilson, good guy husband to Kristen Wiig who she and Bill Hader treat like crap. I wanted to ditch the two tortured souls and go have a beer with him instead. Oh, and the award for most heavy handed symbolism of the year (the goldfish) goes to...you guessed it....\"The Skeleton Twins.\" Grade: B-",
         "'The Skeleton Twins' offers emotional depth, but a half-baked Screenplay, takes away its glory in totality. But, the performances are good! 'The Skeleton Twins' Synopsis: Having both coincidentally cheated death on the same day, estranged twins reunite with the possibility of mending their relationship. 'The Skeleton Twins' begins beautifully, with the bitterness between its sibling protagonists, working well. The sub-plots are the problem here. The track involving an ex-flame is bland, while the secret-affair angle also offers nothing new. Its the main plot, which is filled with moments of true humor & emotions. Craig Johnson & Mark Heyman's Screenplay has potential, but weak sub-plots leave you disappointed. Craig Johnson's Direcion is nicely done. Cinematography is average. Editing isn't great, either. 'The Skeleton Twins' biggest strength lies in its performances. Kristen Wiig is effective, delivering a performance of pure pain. Bill Hader is competent, as well, enacting a difficult part with flourish. And Luke Wilson steals the show. He's genius in here. On the whole, 'The Skeleton Twins' is certainly watchable, but not very memorable.",
         "The Skeleton Twins' strongest belief is valuing and preserving the relationship between siblings to resolve the traumatic memories and experiences of the past and a perpetual domestic crisis, where modern relationships have presently failed to become emotionally gratifying for the main characters. By the end of the film though there is a sense that the main characters, a brother and sister, would rather belong to each other rather than conceding there is a time in our lives when our siblings' path becomes separate from our own. The film's director Craig Johnson has described the film as being like a love story between the brother and sister who rediscover each other. Although a small independent film, the way The Skeleton Twins stresses the traditional values of family and childhood nostalgia is symmetrical with some mainstream Hollywood films. What these films shield from us is that departing from our families as grow older isn't a tragedy. It is a fact of life that accompanies growth and maturity as we leave our families behind to test ourselves as adults. The film isn't an autobiography of its director Johnson but shares some of his personal values and desires. Johnson is an openly gay director who says that he connects strongly to his own sister through humour. The film itself offers clear parallels. It stars former Saturday Night Live comedians Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig as Milo and Maggie, a brother and sister duo who haven't spoken to each other in ten years. The film opens with images of them as children both playing dress-ups, which signposts that in the present day Milo is gay. The siblings are reunited unceremoniously through a juxtaposed suicide attempt. Milo lies in a bath as the water turns bloody and Maggie has a handful of pills ready to swallow. A call stops her from committing suicide and she visits her brother in the hospital. She allows him to stay with her and her husband Lance (Luke Wilson). To Milo's disapproval Lance seems active and jock- like, but he is kind enough to offer his brother-in-law work and encourages Maggie to take diving lessons which lands her in trouble. By being a small slice of life film, Johnson has compared the style of his work to other observational comedy-dramas like Noah Baumbach's The Squid and the Whale. Despite having two comedians in the lead roles, the film has a droll, highly understated and deadpan tone, which distinguishes it from Wiig's broader comedies like Bridesmaids. The film is most honest and real when allowing its leads to make poor choices that enriches the drama and underlines the seriousness of their flaws. Unhappy with her marriage, Maggie secretly takes birth control pills even though Lance believes they are trying for a baby. She also starts having an affair with her obnoxious diving instructor (Boyd Holbrook). Milo is still envious of people in high school and bitter about failing to be an actor. He attempts to reunite with Rich (Ty Burrell), a former high school teacher to whom Milo had a relationship with when he was fifteen. Both siblings are still haunted by their father's suicide when they were children. Through their troubled relationships with other people they grasp at an unreachable past because their adult lives have been disappointing. The plot points are fairly interesting as far as they go but their scarcity also highlights the leanness of the story, meaning the film doesn't elevate to the heights of a Baumbach or Alexander Payne film. The sense of anguish and pain is most impressively humanised by Wiig's surprising and accomplished performance. From the start of the film, her sunken body language perfectly stresses the unhappiness and the weight that she feels in her life. A close-up shot of her face shows a tear running down her cheek during her suicide attempt which further realises the sadness of her character. Additionally, there is a strong climax where Maggie's fury at Milo ignites and the transcendent way that Wiig disappears into her role as she projects this anger rates as a career highlight. There are a few laughs, mostly from the film's quiet and sly humour and a sight gag where Milo tries undertaking gardening work while wearing a t-shirt and scarf. The comedy falters when it becomes more obvious and forced. One example is when Johnson creates set pieces for the two comedians, like when they inhale nitrous oxide at Maggie's dental hygiene workplace, which isn't very funny, and a slightly better scene where their bond is expressed by miming the Starship song \"Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now\". Both sequences express the characters rediscovering the juvenility that cements them together as part of their aim to be childlike. But why are so many films today desperate to make adults into children again? It is a question further amplified by the film's troubled ending, which is contrived and dilutes the stronger ideas about the unreachable past while also bordering on wish fulfillment that siblings will always get us out of a jam. The truth is that everyone has to stand on their own two feet by themselves and learn to keep their own head above the water - even in the movies."
