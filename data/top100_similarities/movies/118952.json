         "norman mclaren's neighbours is a masterpiece of animation- it entertains, educates, and satirizes, all at once. the plot of the film is simple, and predictable: two neighbours are fighting over a flower, which seems to fall directly between their two properties. naturally, the two fight over the flower until both they and the flower are destroyed. however, underneath that simple plot, there lies a strong anti-war message. it points out that war does not allow for winners, only losers; and it reminds us that we've been known to forget why, exactly, we're fighting each other, killing each other, as well as each other's families. the battle is shown with live-action/stop-go animation- which allows the effects of the flower on the two men to be exagarrated easily. this suits the film well, giving a serious topic a little light-heartedness. an interesting side-note- the soundtrack was not recorded, but rather hand-painted (by mclaren himself) onto the soundtrack. this gives the soundtrack a boxy, nintendo-like quality. in my mind, this film could sit easily with modern anti-war classics; never too preachy, never too simple. truly enjoyable.",
         "This short, which combines live-action with stop-motion animation, was nominated for two Oscars and won for Best Documentary Short. The events depicted become more ironic as they unfold and to describe any of the details to any great degree would be unfair to the short and to future viewers. Totally recommended.",
         "This film is amazing. Truly amazing. The knack for animation seems to be one of Canada's greatest gifts, so I guess that would make Norm McLaren the most generous man at the party. This piece is visually stunning; watching the characters cascade across the screen with the help of stop-motion techniques is a thing of beauty. The awkward, electronique-esque soundtrack conjures up, and speaks for, every single emotion that McLaren is trying to get across visually. In eight minutes, McLaren develops the two male characters, and their emotions, better than a feature length Hollywood production could in two hours. Could he have made it longer? Sure...but he said all he needed to say in the few minutes he worked with...namely, \"Love Thy Neighbour\". If you can't find this Oscar winner (for Best Animation Short oh so long ago) you are really missing out on something magical. A thing of beauty, and a Canadian gem. Thanks, Mr. McLaren.",
         "Two neighbours sit opposite one another reading the same paper, smoking the same pipes and enjoying their property and lives. Things get even better when a beautiful flower grows in the middle of the joint garden that both men love for its appearance and aroma. However when they both try to appreciate the flower at the same time a minor squabble starts up regarding ownership of the flower and soon the conflict spirals out of control. I watched this short film after having it mentioned in discussions on classic short films I should see as part of trying to see more films than just the blockbusters that Hollywood kicks out month after month. Watching it more than fifty years after it was made I was surprised by how fresh it did feel. Of course it is still relevant, which is not really down to Maclaren but more down to the nature of man I think but the plot does still work. Modern viewers might feel that it runs a little longer than it should and it is pretty obvious in what it is saying and this was a quibble for me but not a deal breaker. What carried this simple morality tale was the animation, which is stop-motion but still feels fun and creative now. Using live things to do stop motion must be pretty difficult ï¿½ it is a time consuming and painstaking process with clay and things (that can be kept still when you need them to be) but with humans that can lose position it is more challenging. Credit to Maclaren that it looks great and flows really well throughout. A classic short then even if it is not perfect. The simple message is laid on pretty thick and is not as smart as some would say but it is still smart enough to hold it together while the animation feels fresh and inventive.",
         "I have to say I don't mind Norman McLaren getting an Academy Award. I am generally not too big on his movies and that includes this one here, but he is sort of considered a legend in animation from the 20th century, so it's fine with me. That does not change, however, the way I perceived this short film here. It is in color, runs for 8 minutes and not only won the Academy Award, but was nominated in another category as well, something that is not possible today anymore, at least not for short movies. The entire film is about two men fighting for a flower which grows in their garden. First, the dispute is verbally, then it gets physical and in the end it is lethal. The story is too absurd for my taste already, which hurt my perception of this film and I felt that it dragged occasionally. Then again, this is the point as the actions by the two men are not human at all, but basically all special effects. One of the two was Grant Munro, a famous animation filmmaker himself and still alive in his 90s today. This short film from almost 65 years ago did not do a lot for me. Only worth a watch for those who want to see all short film winners from the Oscars. Everybody else is not missing much, even if this is maybe the most famous short film from the legendary NFB.",
         "This humorous and dazzling short film from 1952 features the slapstick hijinks of two neighbors in card-board cut-out land who, upon being seduced by a joy-inducing dandelion (and I mean this literally, I'm not referring to a woman), get into an argument over borders, at which point mayhem ensues. It is a simple and short and entertaining fable complete with moral provided at the end, though there's something to be said about how entertaining the action is despite its theme of non-violence like in mainstream cinema too. However, in terms of sheer inventiveness and animated wizardry, this movie is surprising and awe-inspiring. The creativity behind the actions and how it eventually builds is a testament to McLaren's wit and genius. --PolarisDiB",
         "This is a rather heavy-handed but well made animated short about war. While the message is presented through \"sledgehammer symbolism\" (i.e., it wasn't exactly subtle), the film's stop-motion cinematography was very nice and well done. It certainly is interesting. The movie begins with two normal looking 1950s era guy sitting outside their cutout homes. Both are sitting in lounge chairs reading their newspapers (which, in a not so subtle move, have headlines about war). Then, suddenly, a flower appears on the border of their yards and both think it's the most wonderful flower in the world. However, because they both love it so much, they begin fighting over it--almost like in a Tom & Jerry movie! At first, it's kind of funny, but when it degenerates to attacking their wives and babies, the joke is over. Ultimately, it ends on a very fitting note.",
         "In January 2007 I went to London expressly to attend part of a two-month long Luis Bunuel retrospective held at the National Film Theatre where I caught up with all but one of the remainder of his films. During that same period, a concurrent season of movies featuring Humphrey Bogart (on the 50th anniversary of his death) and Lauren Bacall and another one dedicated to Canadian animator Norman McLaren were also held. Although I am a fan of Animation in general, I was a bit wary of McLaren's work falling in the abstract branch of it but had always been interested in checking it out regardless since the late British film critic Leslie Halliwell deemed his best-known piece BEGONE DULL CARE (1949) worthy of his full **** rating. While the latter was indeed one of several shorts I managed to catch during that one particular evening, I cannot say I was sufficiently impressed to follow it up on my own time, as it were. Still, learning that 3 more films of his were nominated for the Best Short Subject Academy Award, I decided it was high time to reacquaint myself with McLaren's oeuvre given my ongoing Oscar marathon. The 8-minute short under review is the only one of the three to emerge victorious and deservedly so; bafflingly, this won in the Best Documentary Short category while also being nominated for Best Short Subject. The simple plot deals with two neighbors who spend a lazy afternoon basking in the sun and reclining on a chair reading newspapers in front of their respective house but, tellingly, the headlines of one newspaper is completely belied by the other's. Suddenly a flower spurts out from a seed sown right beneath their feet and, after their initial mutual admiration for it, each one lets greed get the better of him and both start claiming it as their own private property. This sets off a battle of wills that soon turns increasingly physical, irrationally violent and ultimately fatal for all three parties; the scene where one erects a barricade between the two houses enclosing the flower on his side of the fence while the other relocates the latter to his advantage or having the flower use its petals to, as it were, take cover from its battling masters adds a nice touch of Surrealism. However, the film's real coup comes at the end when, having trampled on the flower during their struggle, both men are overtaken by a feverish bloodlust that sees them enter each other's home and murder the occupants (a wife and a baby in both cases) through vicious kicking or throwing about! By this time, the violent men have adopted Indian warpaint on their faces and, when they eventually expire, the once-important white fence is transformed into crosses on each respective grave that have been dug where the houses used to stand. With time, more flowers bloom both on the graves themselves and on the earth surrounding them. The end titles, then, is an animated collage of the phrase \"Love Thy Neighbor\" in various languages. Although the film was originally issued sporting a monotone electronic score by McLaren himself (also available on \"You Tube\"), I elected to watch it accompanied by a score (recorded in 2010) by an obscure outfit named Versa that very effectively counterpoints the on screen action.",
         "This films shows the stupidity of all war conflicts throughout human history in a minimalistic and symbolical way. The plot is quite basic - 2 neighbours live peacefully until an apple of discord in the form of beautiful flower appears. They fight over it eventually murdering their families and each other. I have no clue how this film got classified as a documentary. I have no clue how this film could have won an Oscar without the wife and children murder scene. If you throw away the rest of the short and just leave that scene without any backstory,it will touch you deeply in the heart. It captures the essence of war - terror,grief,pain. The pain of the non interfering observer. Despite simplicity of the visual means in this scene,the \"language\" is very grotesque and powerful,one can compare it to the the language of the Bible or Iliad,to the aesthetics of Greek sculpture. All in all it is a must see short,enjoy watching!",
         "I must confess that I am unsure why Norman McLaren's 'Neighbours' is held in such high regard. Whilst it is certainly a fun and very comical short film, it seemed to lack the professionalism that I usually enjoy in my film-making; this particular short just appeared to have been thrown together very cheaply by an amateur. 'Neighbours' was produced at the National Film Board of Canada in Montreal, and it employed a technique known as pixilation, in which live actors are used as stop motion objects. Other portions of the film were created with variable-speed photography, particularly fast-motion. The plot of the film is a very simple allegory for human warfare. According to McLaren, he was inspired to make 'Neighbours' after a temporary stay in the People's Republic of China. After witnessing the beginnings of Mao's revolution, and the onset of the Korean War, he decided to make a strong anti-military and anti-war film statement. In the film, two young men (Grant Munro and Jean Paul Ladouceur) enjoy the sunlight outside their respective cardboard houses. To their surprise, a beautiful aromatic flower grows in the divide between their two properties, and they begin to bicker over ownership of the plant. This small-scale dispute soon escalates into a frenetic mini-war, as each man furiously murders the wife and child of his neighbour (this particular scene was removed prior to submission for the Academy Awards) and the final result is the death of both men, and of the beautiful flower over which they were arguing. The film ends by stating its overall moral quite simply in various languages: \"love your neighbour.\" The film is accompanied by an array of zany sound effects ï¿½ similar to something you might hear in an early arcade game ï¿½ which McLaren created by scratching the edge of the film into various shapes and lines, which the projector then read as sound. At the 1953 Academy Awards, 'Neighbours' was nominated for Best Short Subject (one reel) and it won Best Documentary, Short Subject (somewhat bafflingly, since the film itself is entirely dramatic). I'd consider 'Neighbours' to be an entertaining little film, but without the allegorical resonance that many attribute to it. In terms of film-making, the animation is quite inventive, but ultimately nothing to write home about. Perhaps, placed in the context of the era in which it was made, the film takes on a greater significance."

         "In a minimalistic suburban landscape of surreal proportions, identical houses materialize. These two residences are accompanied by materializing leisure chairs. The chairs become occupied by two male individuals who are smoking pipes and reading newspapers. It becomes apparent that they are a depiction of a somewhat identical pair, akin to twins or even suggesting a mirror image of lives. A careful reading of the news headlines reads \"War certain if no peace\" and conversely \"Peace is certain if no war\". Next, the two characters are startled by the sudden appearance of a single, lovely flowering plant, which grows instantly in the center of their post-modern mystical world. They approach the flower and are mesmerized. The fragrance causes some sort of psychedelic or euphoric effect. One man disappears off screen and the other one goes into hallucination and sensory bliss. They then are carried away into a mutual dance of joy and harmony, due to an appreciation of the flower's potent blessings. Gradually though, there comes trouble in paradise, because the two neighbors start a quarrel over this single plant. It essentially boils down to control and access to this prized resource. The argument escalates into a boundary dispute, as they try to demonstrate to one another, where the correct (yet imaginary) property lines divide the landscape. It is a fight to own the land from which the flower is growing, to prove definite ownership based upon real estate law. A violent struggle ensues when they cannot agree to where the property line actually divides the once-idyllic landscape. They use the pieces of the fence to strike at each other, sparring in a combative duel. An all-out brawl leads to serious injuries for both individuals. It then expands into a war upon their households. They kill each others' wives and their babies by brutal murder, kicking and striking with blunt instruments in the process. After the utter destruction of their homes, they demolish each other in an exhaustive battle. They collapse in death throes, ironically on the opposite side of the fence from their original positions in the leisure chairs. The soil and the scattered fence pieces move around into makeshift graves, with two crosses formed as grave-markers. Finally, the plant splits into two flowers and takes root into both of their graves. The two men are representative of Europe and the U.S. during World War II. The main difference between the characters, being in their dress; one has a necktie and one has a bow tie. Their struggle, as the struggle of empires, is over the goodness and bounty of the Earth and deciding who will rule over it. The outcome is utter failure for both parties, who insist on the struggle when they could instead enjoy all the good things together, as the middle of the movie depicts through their harmonious euphoric dance. This story is a cinematic folk tale using post-modern symbolism. It is a statement against ownership and greed. It concludes with a simple, religious statement, \"Love Your Neighbor\".",
