            "content": "> Neeson is good at it, none other would've played better than him.\r\n\r\nPretty entertaining action flick with a fast paced narration. A typical Liam Neeson's movie. Take a gun and go hunt down the bad guys or protect loved ones from them kind of movie. Under his league, like always he was awesome. This has been a already heard story, like a trivia say. Yes, it was similar to 'Road to Perdition', but happens for a different reason and with the different cast. Still the movie was better that I expected.\r\n\r\nI went speechless when I saw Neeson was begging in the opening scene. Because that's not his style, action heroes like him, Jason Statham, Bruce Willis et cetera, they don't fit in those roles. But what came just a few minutes later was like switching to second, third, fourth and fifth gear in a quick session. You know you can't judge a book by its cover, same applies for this as well. The film was good, I mean better than average, better than ratings and reviews across the web.\r\n\r\nIt was kind of unofficial 'A Man with a Gun' trilogy (I made it up) after 'Unknown' and 'Non-stop'. Because if you check it out all these three film's posters, Neeson will be seen with a gun in the similar fashion. Hope this director and actor comes together to do more movies in the future, since it is a rocking combo. Well, they all might not be the masterpieces, but enjoyable at the time of the watch. Especially it will not disappoint Neeson's fans.\r\n\r\n7/10",

      "synopsis": "Jimmy Conlon (Liam Neeson) is lying on the ground with a gunshot wound in his stomach. We hear his voice saying that your life doesn't flash before your eyes when you die, but rather all the regrets and mistakes you've made. In the distance, Jimmy's son Mike (Joel Kinnaman) is yelling and evading gunfire. Sixteen hours earlier, Jimmy was in a bar. He goes to the basement to find Danny Maguire (Boyd Holbrook), the son of Jimmy's former employer Shawn (Ed Harris), making a deal with some dirty NYPD cops. Jimmy asks Danny for a loan of $800 since his heater is broken. Danny will only give Jimmy the money if he goes to his home as Santa Claus since his last guy canceled. Jimmy reluctantly agrees. Mike works at a gym where he mentors young boys without fathers. One of his closest students is a boy nicknamed Legs (Aubrey Joseph). Mike lives at home with his wife Gabriela (Genesis Rodriguez) and their daughters Catelyn (Guilia Cicciari) and Lily (Carrington Meyer). The couple is also expecting their third child. Gabriela is making a collage for the baby to see what the family's life was before he is born. Mike notices Gabriela put a picture of him as a child with Jimmy. He doesn't want the picture there and obscures his father with a picture of his daughter. Danny meets his father with some Albanians to push a special brand of heroin. Shawn rejects them, to Danny's displeasure. The Albanians tells Danny they'll be at his place to collect the money they gave him to convince his dad to push their heroin. Shawn wants no part of his old lifestyle, which is something that Danny doesn't get. Shawn wonders at what point did his son go wrong. Jimmy does the Santa gig at Shawn's house, only he is drunk and making an ass of himself by hitting on one man's wife. He then burns his hand near the fireplace and swears in front of the kids. Shawn joins Jimmy upstairs as he cools off. They have been friends since youth, and Jimmy was once an enforcer for Shawn. The two share a cigarette. Jimmy is at a diner when he is met by Detective John Harding (Vincent D'Onofrio) and his partner Detective Torres (James Martinez). Harding knows of Jimmy's past and the fact that he's gotten off scot-free from killing for Shawn due to several cops being on Shawn's payroll. He tells Torres that Jimmy was known as \"Jimmy The Gravedigger\". Harding gives Jimmy his card in case he ever needs to call him, or specifically confess for his crimes. Mike, moonlighting as a limo driver, takes the Albanians to Danny's home. As he waits outside, Mike sees Legs riding his bike alone. He tells him to go home or he'll tell his mother. He offers to give Legs a ride home. Meanwhile, inside the house, Danny gives the Albanians a bag of Monopoly money as a joke. The head Albanian threatens Danny, but he responds by shooting him dead and then shooting at his partner. The partner runs outside limping. Legs catches them on video as Danny shoots the man dead. Mike starts the car, but Danny breaks the window open and pulls him out. He forces Mike into his home, when Legs leaves the car. Danny hears the door close, distracting him long enough for Mike to strike Danny. He fights Danny and Danny's friend until he escapes, leaving his wallet behind. Mike runs home and calls Gabriela, who is at her brother Ricky's (Dan Domingues) house with the girls. He tells her to stay there until he calls her back. Mike then hears a pounding sound at the door. It's Jimmy, who got a call about an incident involving Mike. He hasn't been to Mike's home since his wife's funeral. Jimmy goes outside to have a smoke, just as Danny comes into the house. Mike notices him, and Danny approaches him with his gun aimed at Mike. A gunshot goes off, but it's from Jimmy after shooting Danny in the neck. Mike puts pressure on the wound, but Danny dies. Jimmy leaves, and Mike calls the cops, saying his father shot Danny in self-defense. Jimmy then calls Shawn and confesses to what he just had to do. Shawn goes to break the news to his wife, who slaps Shawn in response and then falls to pieces. The dirty cops that met with Danny earlier go to Mike's house and arrest him when they identify Danny's body. Jimmy chases after them through the streets until he rams them hard enough to crash through a store. Jimmy breaks Mike out of the car, and Mike grabs one of the cops' guns. The surviving cop attempts to shoot the two. Mike aims the gun at the cop, but Jimmy stops him and shoots the cop dead himself. This is witnessed by several civilians, and the cops issue a manhunt for Mike and Jimmy. The two go through the subway to find more goons are on their tails. Jimmy fights one man in the bathroom while Mike evades them through the train. He gets Jimmy on with him just in time. Although Mike wants to go to his family, Jimmy tells him that Shawn will be coming after both of them and Mike's family, so he needs to get through the night with Jimmy to survive. Jimmy meets with Shawn to try and ask for forgiveness for what he did to Danny. Shawn instead vows to get to Mike and kill him in first before letting Jimmy die. Two of Shawn's goons hunt for Mike's family at Ricky's house, right after Mike showed up to warn Gabriela and the girls. They hide in the shower as Ricky stalls the goons. They leave the family alone after finding nothing. Shawn calls for a hitman named Price (Common) to go after the two. They go to Legs' apartment to ask for his help. Mike finds Legs' brothers there and tells him to get Legs to help him. A neighbor woman spots Mike and Jimmy, alerting her to call the police. The cops show up soon enough, forcing Mike and Jimmy to plan their escape. They cut the power to the building, just as Price shows up after killing a cop at the door. He gets through the dark stairways with a night-vision lens. He catches up to the two as they leave a fire going off in an apartment. Jimmy fights Price as the building starts to burn. Jimmy burns Price's face and gets him down on the ground, giving Mike an opportunity to shoot Price. However, Jimmy tells him not to pull the trigger. They run as the cops show up, and Price kills them. The apartment explodes as Mike and Jimmy get away. Jimmy brings Mike to his brother Eddie's (Nick Nolte) home. When Jimmy mentions he killed Shawn's son, Eddie freaks out and demands that he leaves. Eddie tells Mike that Jimmy killed their cousin because he was going to testify against Shawn, and Jimmy told Mike that someone else had done it. Mike returns to Ricky's home to get Gabriela and the girls. Lily sees Jimmy standing outside and asks her dad who he is. Mike says it's nobody. Jimmy decides to end this once and for all. He goes to the bar where Shawn operates his business, and Jimmy kills all the hitmen in the bar. He and Shawn end up running out to a trainyard where they start shooting at each other. Shawn starts to run, and Jimmy hesitates to shoot him, but, knowing that Shawn won't stop until he's gotten Mike, he pulls the trigger. Shawn gets hit in the side, and he attempts to keep running, but he falls. Jimmy goes over to Shawn and holds him as he dies. Legs goes to Harding at the police station with the recorded video of Danny killing the Albanian mobster outside his building. Legs also tells Harding who Mike is and why he wouldn't commit these crimes. Jimmy meets Mike with his family at a lake house in North Shore. He finally meets Gabriela and the girls, although Lily doesn't want to say hi to Jimmy. Mike goes outside with the family by the lake to feed ducks. Jimmy stays in the house and sees the collage Gabriela made. He then gets shot through the side by Price, standing in the distance. Mike hears the gunshots and tells Ricky to take the girls somewhere safe. Mike grabs his gun and exchanges fire with Price through the woods. Jimmy gets his rifle, but he is severely wounded and he falls to the ground, knowing he is going to die. With his last bit of strength, he puts one bullet in the rifle and raises it in time to shoot Price in the head before he can kill Mike. Mike rushes to his dad's side right before he dies. Harding and his partners show up. He tells Mike he knows he's innocent. He then looks in Jimmy's hand to see that he's holding a list of everybody he's ever killed. Later on, Mike is at the gym watching Legs fight another kid. Legs beats his opponent, making Mike proud. He returns home to find Gabriela and the girls making Christmas cookies. He goes into his room and puts on formal attire (presumably to Jimmy's funeral). Before he leaves, he takes one more look at the picture of him and Jimmy by the lake.",

         "One of the better action movies I've seen in a while. Great characters - great acting and interesting story line. I really liked this film and I don't understand why this movie does not get better reviews. unlike a lot of the popular glitzy action films, this one leaves a memory of what it was really about. The camera work was great and incorporated some of the best and most believable action scenes I have experienced. The language was fitting and not overpopulated with Fbombs. The story line is easy to follow. The soundtrack is appropriate without a lot of unnecessary crashing and banging, or a way over the top, or overpowering soundtrack. Definitely a good film.",
         "I will first start off by saying do not listen to a word these dumb reviews are saying especially the so-called professional men and women from newspaper company's and etc because they have no idea what they are talking about at all. I absolutely loved this movie from beginning to end it was a highly action oriented film and in my opinion Liam Neeson's best to date beating out both Taken and Non-Stop both of which I own and have seen. The story is simple which makes it easy to follow. I also loved that there are a few scenes where Liam has some very dry humor that made me laugh. The action was Top Notch and continuous for about a good hour and twenty minutes out of a two hour movie. The other actors were Superb including Ed Harris who is always Awesome as well as Joel Kinnaman who did Fantastic. Common rocked as a Hit-man. The movie had great closure and I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves Liam Neeson's movies and even if you are tired of them I feel it's well worth it.",
         "Run All Night is a 2015 American action thriller film written by Brad Ingelsby and directed by Jaume Collet-Serra. The film stars Liam Neeson, Joel Kinnaman, Common, and Ed Harris. This movie is excellent and worth seeing. It tells the story of an aging hit-man Jimmy Conlon (Liam Neeson)who is forced to take on his brutal former boss Shawn Maguire (Ed Harris) to protect his estranged son Mike (Joel Kinnaman) and his family following the death of Shawn's son, Danny (Boyd Holbrook). I really enjoyed watching this Gangster movie from beginning to end. It was so thrilling and kept me so interested to see what will happen in the end. Liam Neeson's acting was so strong that he deserves to win an Oscar. Honestly the acting by all characters was wonderful . I recommend it for teens and adults.",
         "I went to see this because I found out last minute that \"It Follows\" was only limited release and I'M GLAD I DID! When you go see \"Taken 2\" or \"Walk Among the Tombstones\" you expect crazy action which you definitely get with Run All Night. But what you're not expecting is above average story and acting. There was great suspense with solid characters that you start to care about. There's some larger than life feats that Liam pulls off as usual, but it's done well. Giving it a 9 out of 10 might be a little high, but I feel it deserves bonus points for surprising the heck out of me and breaking the recent trend of over the top Liam movies. Don't wait for video on this one; it's a wild ride for the theater.",
         "Liam Neeson plays retired hit-man, James Conlon, and it's one of the finest roles he's played in years with a great performance, and with additional superb acting from Joel Kinnaman, whom plays his son, Mike Conlon. The first 'Taken' may have turned out great, until it launched a franchise, but 'Run All Night' is a definite improvement over Neeson's latest work, and a major improvement over clichéd action movies released in the past decade. What makes it so good, is that Neeson brings company with him: his co-star Kinnaman who plays his son - and it's a different movie experience altogether as in most clichéd action thrillers the main protagonist, usually played by a familiar action star, is usually without company the whole way through. The character James Conlon is so similar to Jimmy Bobo, a part Sylvester Stallone played in a movie called 'Bullet to the Head'. Jimmy Bobo was an ageing hit-man who still made hits on assignments, but compared to Conlon, he's more emotionless and merciless. Neeson's Conlon still had good in his heart somewhere, whereas Bobo cared more about killing and seeking vengeance. However, the action sequences are enjoyable and thrilling, acting is great and the direction and screen writing becomes intriguing whenever the main plot kicks in - so Run All Night has what it takes of being one of the most exciting movies of the year!",
         "Mobster and hit man Jimmy Conlon has one night to figure out where his loyalties lie: with his estranged son, Mike, whose life is in danger, or his longtime best friend, mob boss Shawn Maguire, who wants Mike to pay for the death of his son. Run all Night stars Liam Neeson, Joel Kinnaman, Ed Harris and is directed by Jaume Collet-Serra who brought us Unknown and Non-Stop. It's an exciting and funny movie to watch when you have nothing else to do and you're bored. It is quiet entertaining for what it is. People should know that by now: don't mess with Liam Neeson's family! When I first saw the trailer I was expecting yet another \"not-so- good\" film starring Liam Neeson such as Walk Among the Tombstones; but this film is definitely a good action movie with some drama thriller touches here and there. At first, Liam Neeson is just a beaten drunk broken man and throughout the film you really start to care about this man who is hunted by some of the things he's done in his past; as well as his son and Ed Harris characters. You really feel like they have a past, it feels like things have happened to them before; which shows a very well built story. Those are the best characters: when you're able to envision character's background before the movie start, they exist beyond the movie. In fact, this movie takes place in a city in one night, which is a good thing for the action plot because everyone is constantly moving. However, on the other hand it makes things a little hard to keep up with this bunch of informations: cops, drug dealers, mob bosses, Liam Neeson and his son, his son's family and their relationship with him, his relationship with Ed Harris and last but not least an assassin is thrown in the middle of everything. This cool hit-man stars Common and it would be great to know more about his story rather than being thrown out there with his futuristic Google glasses (which were super cool by the way). Finally, there's one cameo scene that I won't spoil; it seems a little bit forced and completely irrelevant to the main plot of the movie. It doesn't fit in at all, it's like a completely different movie. Overall Run All Night is not as good as the first Taken movie but it ads a little more heart, substance and more depth though. It's very fun and suspenseful thriller, it has good characters and good action sequences.",
         "Liam Neeson is back yet again with another action film. Some will claim this is another Taken film, and maybe he is cashing in big time on his success from that franchise, but the story in this film is much deeper overall than the recent Taken films, and the acting is absolutely amazing. With some great acting and a good story overall, Liam Neeson and the legendary Ed Harris deliver a must see film for any movie fan. The following is my review of Run All Night. Run All Night was written by writer Brad Ingelsby who is very well known for his fabulous work on the 2013 film Out of the Furnace. I actually did not know that going into the film, after seeing he did write the film, I'm not surprised the characters were so greatly written. The story follows Mobster Shawn Maguire(Ed Harris) and his longtime friend and hit man Jimmy Conlon(Liam Neeson). These two have been friends for a great many years, even decades. Now that they are older and have children, things aren't exactly the same, more so for Jimmy. While Shawn is still very much close to his son Danny(Boyd Holbrook), Jimmy hasn't spoken to his son Mike(Joel Kinnaman) in several years. One night Mike has a big job as a limo driver, but the people he is driving around get into some dirt that makes Mike and Jimmy enemies with Shawn. Shawn promises to hunt Mike and Shawn down and kill them, and their family members because of the death of his son. The story is very rich in characters, and you actually care about them. While the film is nearly two hours, you honestly aren't looking at your watch at all. The film flows by perfectly because of the amazing writing by Brad Ingelsby. Overall, Ingelsby does another fabulous job of writing in this film, and his efforts on this film should not be overlooked. The film was directed by Jaume Collet-Serra who is no stranger to working with Liam Neeson on action films. He previously worked with Neeson on Unknown and last years Non-Stop. The action in this film is not exactly a great deal, but easily much more than last years Non-Stop. There are some fabulous hand to hand combat action scenes, and even one heck on a chase scene. Though the chase scene can be convoluted because of some shaky cam work. Collett-Serra delivers this nice way of changing location in the film from scene to scene by zooming out of the current scene and showing a high rise city view, then slowly zooming in on the new location. While this clever way of changing might have been slightly overused, it was used perfectly and if something different. The acting was really another great aspect of the film, and when you have two legends like Ed Harris and Liam Neeson on the screen together, of course great things will happen. Neeson and Harris really play great off of each other, and you really believe the story as it plays out. The film also features great acting from Joel Kinnaman, Vincent D'Onofrio, and even Common fits in nicely with his small but important role in the film. With mostly great action and absolutely fabulous acting, Collett-Serra and Neeson have easily delivered another epic action film that will live on for many years to come. The film was composed by composer Junkie XL who is well known for working with legendary composer Hans Zimmer. He recently scored films such as Divergent and 300: Rise of an Empire, and will be scoring next years Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. The score XL delivers is nothing great nor something I would claim is memorable, but his work here easily adds some much needed depth in the bigger action scenes. There are some interesting things he does throughout the film, and this is easily a score I will be going back to listen to over and over for the next few weeks to see if it grows on me even more. Junkie XL doesn't deliver the greatest score to an action film, but the score is still very much top notch. In closing, this is a very enjoyable film, which is certainly worth the price of admission. I personally spent almost ten dollars on this film and still feel I got my money's worth and then some. The replay value seems to be high with not only the great visuals from the directing angle, but also from the great performances from the actors. Fans of films in general should put this film on on your list to watch, certainly a must see film. 8/10",
         "Before you dismiss the latest Liam Neeson action movie 'Run All Night' as yet another iteration of 'Taken', let us reassure you that there is much more to this mob thriller than meets the eye. True, Neeson plays a former man of violence with a 'particular set of skills' who is forced to employ them in order to save his family, but that's about where the similarities end. Indeed, while that franchise never quite had any ambition than as a glorified B-movie, this latest team-up between Neeson and his 'Unknown' and 'Non-Stop' collaborator Jaume Collet- Serra proves itself as an impressive amalgamation of the Oscar- nominated dramatic skills on which his earlier career was built on and his more recent kickassery. Brad Inglesby's script starts by giving us a glimpse of Neeson after the fateful events of the titular evening � that is, lying in a forest and bleeding from a shotgun wound � before rewinding sixteen hours before to fill us in. As we soon learn, Neeson's Jimmy Conlon wasn't in a much better state before his most recent run-in with mob boss and childhood friend Shawn Maguire (Ed Harris) that had led to his current predicament. An alcoholic mocked by the denizens at the local pub for farting in his sleep, the former Brooklyn hit-man was once Shawn's trusty right-hand man, but has now been reduced to playing Santa at the latter's son's birthday party for quick cash, which he spends drowning his guilt over the people he has killed and the family he has alienated through the years. As bad luck would have it, Jimmy's estranged son, Mike (Joel Kinnaman), who only wants to take care of his pregnant wife and two young kids and to have nothing to do with his father, stumbles upon Danny executing two Albanian drug dealers. When Danny turns up at Mike's house, Jimmy intervenes to save his son and ends up killing Danny, setting in motion the subsequent series of events which will see father and son move through New York City while being pursued by Danny's men � including a professional assassin named Price (Common) who has his own grudge with Jimmy � as well as crooked cops looking to stay on Shawn's payroll. Rather than just skip to the chase, Collet-Serra and his screenwriter Inglesby invest in a more character-driven narrative than may be expected. A pivotal scene has Jimmy confessing to Danny's murder shortly after Shawn returns from the morgue to identify his son's body, which poignantly expresses not just one father's grief (and consequent thirst for revenge) from the death of his son but also another father's paternal instinct to protect his family by whatever means possible. Whereas 'Taken' (pardon the pun) the latter for granted, Collet-Serra wisely lets the polarising dynamic between Jimmy and Shawn define the conflict that ensues, giving both characters and their longstanding friendship turned brutal rivalry both shading and nuance. Lest it be forgotten, Neeson and Harris are both accomplished actors in their own right, and both manage to find their characters' empathetic core. Collet-Serra understands Neeson's 'particular set of skills' in playing the fallible hero, and gives his lead actor space and breadth to explore his character's vulnerabilities and motivations � even bringing in an unbilled Nick Nolte to add patriarchal weight to the proceedings. Kinnaman doesn't get enough quiet scenes with Neeson for their father-son relationship to develop into something truly compelling, but the actors share a good rapport that give the action scenes added emotional texture. And in that department, Collet-Serra doesn't disappoint. Reining in the hand-held shots that made the last 'Taken 3' an absolute nightmare to watch even on the big screen, Collet-Serra fashions a couple of impressive sequences that make full use of its New York locale. A thrilling cop-car chase through the streets of Brooklyn easily puts 'Taken 3's' highway chase to shame, while a high-rise apartment complex on fire provides a tense backdrop against which Jimmy and Mike attempt to protect a kid witness. There is also the iconic Madison Square Garden, which provides the scene for a daring escape right after a Rangers-Devils game, and heightens the Big Apple atmosphere while keeping the gritty noir-ish feel of the earlier scenes. It is certainly tempting to see this as yet another attempt to cash in on Neeson's newfound action hero status, but 'Run All Night' distinguishes itself with some well-filmed setpieces to satisfy the adrenaline-hungry crowd while staying grounded with enough characterisation and good acting for its audience to be rooted with the characters on screen. It is also his best collaboration yet with Collet-Serra, who seems genuinely interested at making a movie tailored to the actor's strengths than simply cashing in on a fad. Even and especially if you were disillusioned with 'Taken 3', 'Run All Night' is a good, solid slab of macho entertainment that should wash away the bitter taste of that over-the-hill franchise.",
         "Spoilers Ahead: The movie this is most like is Unforgiven. An evil monster who hates what he is and is feared and loathed by all who meet him. Michael, his estranged son, keeps his family a long way from Jimmy. Only the mob boss, now going legitimate, who feels guilty for making Jimmy the monster he is, will associate with him. Like Unforgiven, Jimmy is sucked into events that make him return to the killing monster he was. Michael witnesses Danny, Shawn's son, shooting some heroin dealers, and Danny decides to kill Michael. Once Jimmy shoots Danny to prevent him from killing Michael, the old nightmare returns. The best line to understand Jimmy is his answer to the cop,\"Just because I'm not in prison doesn't mean I'm not being punished.\" Forgive the moralist, I enjoy movies dissonant with today's decadent libertinism that dare to depict Evil as its own punishment. Yes, it is and how rare in a modern American movie. The film follows Jimmy protecting Michael one nightmarish night. Along the way, Michael learns to see the man inside of the monster. I liked where Jimmy said he had to leave them to protect them from the monster he had become. These characters are not the cardboard cut outs of Taken. Good and Evil are blended together like real human beings. Even after Jimmy shoots Shawn, there still is affection between them. As he dies in his arms, the complexity that is the quintessence of dichotomous creatures both light and night is delineated well. Yes, the movie is violent, graphic and ugly in parts. I could have lived without seeing Shawn repeatedly stabbing Danny's partner in the back. Jimmy kills plenty of people coming for Michael. I admit the critics are right about the final shot with the rifle; it was pure fantasy. It is not important not to miss the forest for the trees with this movie. The microcosmic image of this film is dead Jimmy clutching in his deceased hand the list of all the families he destroyed serving Shawn that the cop wanted so badly. This is the very essence of the movie: an evil man filled with guilt trying to show his love for his son; indeed, he gives his very life for all of them. Taken was a live action cartoon utterly devoid of any reality. Here, Jimmy dies at the end; this is not a cartoon. Yes, the final shot is a flaw, you are right, but the theme of the movie is meritorious within this antithetical Zeitgeist. Harris and Neeson create characters with depth to them full of ambivalence like real human beings. Like Munny, he is seeking redemption; in Jimmy's case it costs him everything. My favorite scene in the movie is the last one where Michael has put Jimmy's picture back up. Like what is done humorously in Uncle Buck, the performance of good is never too late as long as one is still breathing. Like Munny, several times Jimmy stops Michael from killing people,\"You pull that trigger you become just like me.\" The movie is relentlessly intense and well acted with great writing. Try finding another film this deeply moral beneath the action. Any movie that models nobility: giving your life to protect helpless ones will be forgiven, by me, a multitude of flaws. A Good Movie.",
         "RUN ALL NIGHT is the best sins-of-the-fathers revenge thrillers I've seen in a long time. Liam Neeson Vs. Ed Harris is like Ali and Liston in a ring and they're just so damn good, you'd want the rounds to keep going. A bloody, hard-hitting mob action/drama that would sure entertain us gangster movie fans everywhere. It's an unforgiving city in RUN ALL NIGHT. Liam Neeson plays professional Brooklyn pitman, Jimmy \"The Gravedigger\" Conlon, who's best friends with his boss, Sean Maguire. But when Sean's son, Danny, is about to kill Jimmy's son, Michael, Jimmy does what he needs to protect Michael at all cost. Hunted by the mobs, Jimmy and Michael must survive the night and hope that they can get their version of the truth to the only good cop in town. The scene of Ed Harris and Liam Neeson in a restaurant across from each other, face to face, is reminiscent of Al Pacino and Robert De Niro's iconic scene in Michael Mann's \"Heat,\" the difference is Ed and Liam's characters share a background, they share a past, you get to see Ed and Liam both stating their cases, exchanging threats, it's a display of caliber performances, anytime you get two heavyweight actors like this in a room together, you'd want them to throw lines at each other that would set the tone for the rest of the movie, that there's going to be bloodbath from that point forward. The final conflict between those two characters is more or less a carbon copy of screenwriter Brad Ingelsby's previous film, \"Out Of The Furnace,\" it does give you the impression like Ingelsby can't come up with a different scenario and you wonder if he's going to rehash the same thing again in his next movie, but RUN ALL NIGHT aims to give you a satisfying closure, just like those Martin Scorsese's gangster movies where you just know that the bad guys will eat a bullet, there's no room for them to walk into the sunset breathing free. Another thing that's interesting about Liam Neeson's character, Jimmy, is, well, the way we can describe it is.. what if Whitey Bulger had a conscience?! Liam's Jimmy is pretty much Whitey with regrets. Director Jaumet Collet-Serra's previous run with Liam Neeson was 2011's \"Unknown\" and 2014's \"Non-Stop\" both of which didn't impress me, I guess third time's the charm. Instead of a plane, this time Collet-Serra has everybody in New York city hunting down Liam and Joel Kinnaman. And what you get is a gritty, merciless, well-shot movie with so many gun fights, you would think that you're watching a western flick. And I like that, this is what we want from a revenge thriller. And in the middle of the storm is the father-and-son redemption drama that leaves a lasting impression. Read more at Ramascreen.Com"
