It surely dramatized (it's a film after all), but it doesn't seem to be pulling any punches.\r\n\r\nThe colors, the lighting, the stories that intertwine... pretty damn good. But what I liked the most was that there's no happy ending. It's a not a feel good movie. It's raw, just like life and it's how it should be.",

      "synopsis": "The film opens with Sal (Ethan Hawke), a cop, talking to Carlo (Vincent D'Onofiro) about a traffic stop in which Carlo was pulled over for drunk driving. Carlo explains to Sal that he was in a bar fight and thought that the people in the bar were going to kill him. He left intoxicated and was pulled over. Carlo further explains that when in front of a judge, he explained the situation to him, and the judge's rebuttal to his statement was there are \"righter\" and \"wronger\". He was right for leaving the bar in haste, but he was wrong for driving drunk. Sal laughs with Carlo and then...BANG! Sal shoots him in the face. He reacts to Carlo's body, almost vomiting at his action. Sal grabs a bloody paper bag, filled with money, and leaves. We then see Eddie Dugan, a cop on the verge of retirement and suicide waking up. He pours a shot of whiskey for himself and then puts an unloaded service revolver in his mouth and pulls the trigger. He continues on with his daily routine of getting ready. We then see news footage of a shooting in Brooklyn's project houses of a mother grieving over the death of her young son, who was killed by a cop. After seeing that, we are introduced to Tango (Don Cheadle), an undercover cop who infiltrated a major drug ring in Brooklyn. He meets with Red, a gangster friend and C-Rayz, another gangster. The three go into a crack den and drug operation located in one of the apartments in the projects. Tango looks outside the windows to see the place is crawling with police officers due to the young boy being killed. Sal is in confession, confessing the murder that he committed saying that it was justified because he was a bad guy but it was also for the money that he stole from him. The priest says that we are all imperfect creatures and we need to pray for God's forgiveness. Sal exclaims, \"I don't want God's forgiveness. I want his fucking help.\" The priest is taken aback and Sal apologizes for his language and attitude before saying a Hail Mary to repent his sin. He storms out of the church. Sal then goes to the precinct to punch in for work, where he sees Ronny (Brian F. O'Byrne), his best friend. Sal and Ronny, along with the others in the Narc team are debriefed by the captain about Brooklyn and how it is crowned the number one crime precinct in the state. Sal and Ronny converse when Sal asks about Carlo. Ronny says they found him dead. Sal, nonchalantly, asks if they have any leads. Eddie is in the locker room, getting ready to walk the beat when two policemen, both nasty to him, confront him and poke fun at him. Eddie laughs it off because he doesn't care anymore because he is retiring. One cop confronts Eddie, rather violently, but is restrained by the other. Eddie marks off another day from the calendar. Eddie is told by his commanding officer that he needs to break a couple rookies in during his last days on the job. Eddie takes it, begrudgingly, saying that he only has a couple more days on the job. The CO tells him to do something good with the last couple hours on the job. Tango meets with his UC contact, Bill Hobarts (Will Patton) at a diner. Tango wants his life back along with his wife, who has already signed divorce papers. Bill tells him that he is working on it. Tango tells Bill that he is in too deep. During a traffic stop in which Tango was pulled over, he felt the need to kill the cop because Red was carrying a pistol and drugs on him. But, he didn't and was let go because of who he is. Tango again, tells Bill, that he needs his life back. Eddie rides with a rookie around the Brooklyn projects. The rookie, Melvin, is eager to tell Eddie his life story but Eddie could careless. Eddie stops by a store to pick up a fishing rod because his plan is to go live in Connecticut after he retires and fish. The Rookie sees a woman being slapped by a man and attempts to stop it when Eddie intervenes, telling him that it isn't their district. Melvin becomes pissed off and over zealous about this and doesn't want to talk to Eddie anymore. Tango tries to call his wife, but finds that there is no one there to pick up. He sees his car getting ticketed by the meter maid and throws a glass bottle at cart the meter maid is driving and tells him to get a real job. Sal arrives home to his four kids and pregnant wife, Angie. He tells his kids that they are getting a new house and all. Sal goes to the basement to see that he spoke too soon when finding out that Carlo didn't have all the money, only half. He hides the money and washes the blood off of his hands. Angela and Sal talk about their new house that Sal has lined up. Angela is pregnant with twins and has asthma. The wood mold in the house is slowly killing her and the twins, which is prompting Sal to get the new house. He calls up the sales agent that is handling the house and tells her that he has the money to put on the down payment. Tango is entering in a club where he sees his old friend, Caz (Wesley Snipes). Caz and Tango hug and talk out on a roof about business and how Caz wants back into the business after being incarcerated for 7 years. Tango, after almost being killed in prison where he was undercover for two years, was saved by Caz, which explains their friendship. Eddie is in Chinatown, seeing a prostitute named Chantel. Eddie is outside, approaching the building to see a thug getting a drugged out prostitute in a car. The Thug looks to Eddie and then moves to the car. Eddie, knowing something shady was going on, continues into the building. He has sex with the prostitute and sits down at a table after. Chantel talks to Eddie about his life, and then decides to give him oral sex while he tells her about his life and how depressed he is. Sal prays with his kids and reflects how the prayer before his kids sleeping affects him to the core. He knows he needs this new house. We then cut to the crack house apartment where Randy, a teenage drug dealer, is leaving the apartment. Sal and a group of Narc officers grab him and tell him to show them up. They do and the apartment is raided. Sal looks throughout the apartment for money and sees a man running away from the building. He follows and catches him only to find out that he is clean and just ran because he was scared. Sal lets him go. Tango meets with Bill and meets Smith (Ellen Barkin), a hard-nosed bitch aiming for Chief of police. She tells him that they need Caz in jail, to Tango's despise, and he knows that he must do it. She promises him that if Caz is put away then Tango gets Detective First Grade. Tango agrees and then leaves. Sal plays poker with his friends in his basement. Ronny and Sal talk about taking drug money. While Ronny says he would never, Sal says that he doesn't care because it doesn't go anywhere but the evidence room. Ronny says that he is bullshitting but Sal doesn't respond to it. One of the cops there makes a racist comment and Sal punches him. The cop says that he would take a bullet for Sal and asks why he did that. Sal and Ronny talk, both trying to calm down. Sal says that he doesn't have money for twins and Ronny says that he is blessed and that him and his wife cannot have kids. An intercepting sequence starts between the three cops. Eddie is riding with a new rookie and sees that Melvin has gone with another cop all together. Tango and Caz meet with Red on the roof to see that they are beating Randy for information about the bust. Sal and Ronny are at the hospital with Angie and is told that one of the twins is in jeopardy because of the wood mold. Sal and Ronny leave the hospital to go on another raid. Eddie and The Rookie respond to a shoplifting call, which is escalating between the suspect (a 15 year old kid) and victim. Red beats the hell out of Randy for information and threatens to burn his eyes out with a cigarette. Caz stops him. Sal enters a convenience store with the Narc team to make a drug bust. Eddie leaves the convenience store to run identifications on both the suspect and victim. While out, The Rookie loses control of the situation and tries to subdue the suspect but accidentally shoots two rounds off inches from his face. Sal and Ronny bust the drug den and in the midst of the violence, Sal saves Ronny's life while attempting to steal drug money for himself. Caz tells Red to let Randy go. Red questions Tango when he tries to diffuse the situation but Tango pistol whips him and tells him to back up or he'll be the one thrown off the roof. Eddie is in with Internal Affairs about the shooting and is asked to say that it was a drug related incident to make the precinct look better. He declines and tells them to \"fuck off\". They cannot legally do anything because he is retiring. Sal, hearing a voice mail on his phone, is informed that the real estate office must put the house on the market and can only wait another day. Ronny approaches him and thanks him. But, Sal says that he if he thought twice he wouldn't have lifted a finger for him and to stop thanking him. Tango is on the docks talking to Caz about getting out of the game. Tango says that there are two people up town that he needs to talk to about a big deal, after that he says that Caz should disappear. The two people are undercover cops and Tango is setting him up, unbeknownst to Caz. Caz says to make the deal. Tango, at his apartment, looks at a lock box with his pistol, badge and pictures of his wife in it. He puts a memory stick in his card and sets it up so it can record the conversation. At the bar, Caz meets with Tango's fellow undercover cops and they make the deal. Tango goes to the bathroom and smashes the phone, pissed off that he is doing this. Eddie is on the last day and is in the middle of surrendering his badge. He takes it and sees that his badge means nothing as it is thrown into a cardboard box along with dozens of others. Tango calls Bill and says that he is out of the case and he is off of it. Bill says that it doesn't matter anymore because the Feds are closing in on Caz. Tango leaves his apartment to look for him. Tango finds Caz playing chess in the streets and explains to him that he cannot make the deal. Caz is confused by this, but before Tango can tell him...BANG!, BANG!, BANG!, Caz is shot and killed by Red in a drive by shooting. Tango goes to meet with Bill after the shooting, pissed off to see that police were all there to just watch Caz die. Tango yells at Smith and attacks her after a racist comment. Bill restrains him and tells him that he might have screwed himself out of Detective. Smith, impressed says that he didn't and should have made him sergeant. Bill tells Tango to take his life back but he knows that he can't. Eddie meets with Chantel to see her with a \"client\". He waits outside and sees that the \"client\" was a cop. He moves into her place to see her cleaning herself. She gives him a gold watch and he asks her to come to Connecticut with her but she refuses and tells him to get out. He does so, hurt. He sits in his car, loads his gun with one bullet and then... Eddie sees The Thug again, moving three women into a panel van. Eddie recognizes one of the girls as a Missing Person posted on the bulletin in the precinct. He follows the van. Tango is preparing himself to make an attack on Red. Sal gets information for a crack den in the apartment complex where LOTS of money is. He takes the information and goes with it. Ronny follows him and says that he should be grateful for what he has, but he doesn't listen. Sal shoots out Ronny's tires so he can't follow him and continues on. Eddie gets to the Brooklyn Projects to see the three women being unloaded from the van. Tango gets to the Brooklyn Projects and moves into the building seeing Randy outside, waiting on any deals and saying hi to Tango and saying that what happened to Caz was messed up. Sal is seen by Randy at the same Brooklyn Project and is confused to see a white cop with a gun in that area. Tango takes the elevator ride down. Sal prays in a separate elevator in the other building. Eddie approaches the apartment with the kidnapped girls in it. The elevator doors open to see Sal leaving and going to Apartment 5B, where the money is. Red, C-Rayz and another Thug stand by the elevator when it opens up, Tango fires a round into the Thug's chest and shoots Red in the gut. Red races off. C-Rayz says that he doesn't have any beef with Tango and tells him to \"do what you gotta do\". Tango follows a blood trail left by Red. Sal breaks into the apartment and kills the three Thugs in it and searches for the money. He looks throughout the apartment and then sees the Washer and it is not plugged in. He opens it to find a million in cash. He is stuffing the money in every pocket he has and then, BANG! BANG! BANG! Sal takes a last drag of a cigarette and then falls to the floor, bullet wounds in his chest. He chokes on blood and then looks to see Randy holding the pistol. He chokes on the blood and then dies. Eddie approaches the apartment with the girls and waits for a naked thug to leave the room to take a shower. Tango moves out into the streets, gun in hand, following Red. Red tells him that he didn't want to kill Tango and that Caz was getting soft. Tango says that he is a cop and that Red shouldn't have killed Caz. Red asks \"Are you gonna gun me down in the streets?\" Tango replies coldly, \"Yeah.\" Tango unloads an entire clip into Red and reloads to fire more when BANG! Tango is shot through the back. He turns around and is shot again by Ronny. Ronny moves to the body and sees that it is a cop and yells for someone to call 911. Ronny enters the apartment 5B to see Sal dead. He cries at the sight of him dead, surrounded by bloody money. Eddie enters in the apartment and frees the girls. The half-naked thug tries to stop him but Eddie handcuffs him to the space heater on the wall. The kidnapping thug enters the apartment and Eddie shoots him in the chest. The thug doesn't die and attacks Eddie, throwing him around like a rag doll. He pins Eddie against a shelf, when Eddie grabs a zip tie and strangle and locks it on to the thugs throat, so he chokes to death. The police crawl around the scene, two cops dead, and four gangsters. Eddie walks away from the scene, beaten but still alive.",

         "This is a dark, moody movie that explores the angst of 3 cops. One, on an undercover assignment, realises that the more time he spends with crooks, etc., the more likely he will become like them. His request for a transfer is promised, on condition that he \"brings in\" Mr Big. Another, a \"good catholic\", has more kids than sense and desperately needs to improve his fortunes if his family is to survive. The third, an older, reticent, solitary man on the brink of retirement is totally without illusions about his job or his place in society. Doing his time and collecting his reward (his pension) is all that matters to him. He is aloof and uncommunicative with his colleagues, biding his time until he can quit. Only with an attractive hooker, that he sees regularly, does he show any sign of humanity. All 3 are. basically, decent men working in indecent scenarios and their respective paths cross in a way and at a time and in a place that \"we can all see coming\" but is no less moving for that. There is a kind of poetry to this, albeit on the darkish side. that lingers . Watching this requires some patience at the beginning, particularly with Richard Gere, whose role as the older cop, asks him to be almost a silent participant in the events, but whose performance grows as the stories unfold. But all the cast are excellent. Cheadle, Hawke, Snipes, D'Onofrio and an eye-catching turn by Ellen Barkin as \"the agent from Hell\" See this................... 8/10",
         "Brooklyn's Finest is clich√©d cop film only in setup, not in execution. The scripting and a plethora of strong performance elevate the familiar veins that make up the films structure. In fact, three of the most standard-order plot lines are utilized; and undercover cop who blurs the line between righteous and corrupt, a drug cop who exhibits no blurring in his corruption and an aging veteran slugging it through his last week on the job. These cops are played by Don Cheadle, Ethan Hawk and Richard Gere respectively and each gets equal screen time in a triple thread story that eventually converge on one fateful night. Director Antoine Fuqua's latest treads a thin line between tragic and gritty and outright depressing. This is a gloomy film to be sure, everyone is either a cop, murderer, drug dealer or prostitute (sometimes many of the above) and there is no glimpse of sunshine, so to speak, in Fuqua's Brooklyn. I am a big fan of Fuqua, from his John Woo-esquire debut with The Replacement Killers to the classic cop drama Training Day, to the very underrated Bruce Willis war actionier Tears of the Sun, he is more than a competent auteur and always brings out solid performances from his leads. Hawk (who plays the increasingly corrupt Sal) is perhaps the strongest of three leads, but Gere and Cheadle are very convincing in their roles as well. Unfortunately, despite the admirable development of these characters, the aforementioned ordinary narrative leaves little question about where their respective paths are headed. We also get a blazing comeback from the one and only Wesley Snipes as a criminal and friend of Cheadle's Tango. Rounding off the talented main players are Brian F. O'Byrne as Sal's fellow cop and friend and Will Patton as Tango's lone remaining contact to the just world he feels is fading away. As I have iterated many times, it is the stellar work from the key players that makes Brooklyn's Finest worth your time. The drive behind these three cops is equally compelling. Sal has 5 kids (with 6 and 7 on the way) and is swimming in debt. Through a real-estate contact he sets up a deal to move his growing family to a larger house, only if he can get the big score of drug money he needs. As the date approaches for him to come up with the money he grows increasingly desperate. Gere's Eddie is a burnt-out cop who has all but lost respect for the job, and his fellow cops have all but lost respect for him. His only remaining duty is to escort a rookie around for his final 7 days but things go far less smoothly then he could have hoped. Finally there is Tango, a UC who has lost all his ties to the real world. His wife is filing for divorce and he wants to be made detective first grade a.s.a.p. and spend the remainder of his days behind a comfortable desk and away from a life of crime. In one of the best sequences, Tango is asked why the sudden urge to get out. He tells of a night where he was pulled over by the cops for speeding and legitimately considered killing them. He wants out. If only the despair had been laid on a little less thick and the stereotypes that make up the three main characters polished with a bit more inventiveness, Brooklyn's Finest could have been a classic in the making. Instead we get only what we would expect; a gritty, bloody and well acted police actionier. Read all my reviews at simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com",
         "Brooklyn's Finest rests on the strong character portrayals of the lives of three ordinary men struggling at different points in their careers. What they each share is the New York Police Department as a workplace. Life isn't perfect - it never is. We always have to give something up in order to do something else - it's called choice. Therein lies man's fatal freedom. Sal (Ethan Hawke) gave up the possibility for flash when he became a cop. He has a growing family with numerous kids but lives in a decrepit, run-down house where the wood mold is causing his pregnant wife lung problems. His NYPD salary isn't sufficient for him to move to a different abode. Can we judge him? It is a context that bears for some humanity from our part. He will do things in the film, but it is difficult for us to point our fingers from a high horse, for we aren't in his situation. Does the end justify the means? While doing undercover work in prison, Tango (Don Cheadle) is saved from death by an inmate, Casanova Philips (Wesley Snipes). The event forms a bond between them. Now Casanova is back out and the force want Tango to send him back in. By taking this shortcut to Detective first grade (read: becoming an undercover agent), Tango is forced to deal with harsh consequences, namely the fact that his wife is in the process of leaving him, and that other than Casanova he has no friends. Eddie (Richard Gere) is retiring and is a morally decadent seemingly useless member of the force. He gets teased by his younger co-worker cops, and seems fed up with his life. We see him put a revolver to his mouth in the morning. Even though he is 7 days away from retirement he must take care of young rookies, fresh faces new to the NYPD. Eddie doesn't get along well with them. It is unclear what happened to his wife, but Eddie now seeks solace in the womanly comforts of a lowly Chinatown hooker. These grotesquely authentic lives are laid out with the aid of a soundtrack that simultaneously sets the pace and follows the psychological states of the main protagonists. The tone of the music will change, for instance, when a particular character is in a tight situation, a situation where he is again confronted with choice. All the actors in this film pull off magnificently intense portrayals. Especially worthy of mention are Cheadle, Snipes, Gere and Hawke -- who once again shows that he can enter the mind of a struggling cop like no other. A steady-paced, involving thriller definitely worth a gander. 8/10.",
         "Antoine Fuqua aims high within the limitations he has for Brooklyn's Finest. By that I mean the film is fairly low-budget, or at least middle of the road (my guess is twenty million), and it was shot on location in Brooklyn and places around. He also has a script that has its share of clich√©s and potential pitfalls for cinematic treatment. It's surprising how well the film comes off with the elements, and they are ALL familiar: the cop just nearing retirement (Gere), on his way out, who has to shepherd a rookie through his first days on the; a corrupted cop (redundant mayhap) that is scrounging for any money he can on raids (Hawke) needs it for a slightly noble cause, a new house for his growing family; a cop undercover (Cheadle) has to choose promotion or loyalty with a criminal takedown on the horizon. Three very recognizable types, and the tropes are there, at least on paper. But where Fuqua sets himself apart, as he did to a good if not great extent on Training Day, is to imbue importance (not pretentious but just enough for serious effect) in the direction of scenes, and in casting. The actors take material that could be trite and unconvincing and even stale post-Lumet-cop-movie stuff and make it their own, compelling and heartfelt, and true to the extent that the genre allows. There's real tragedy felt with Hawke's character, albeit he may overact just a bit in some scenes, since this corrupt cop wouldn't be so bad if he could get what he needs (\"I don't want God's forgiveness, I want his help,\" he says in confession), and likewise real conflict with Cheadle's undercover, who has been embedded too long in the trenches, and wants to help the criminal who once saved his life (Wesley Snipes fantastic in an older, slightly wiser version of his character in New Jack City). And then there's Gere. One almost forgets Gere's successes when he's starring in romantic-comedy junk like... well, what's he been in recently for starters. But then one looks at Unfaithful, Days of Heaven, The Hoax, I'm Not There, among some others, and one sees Gere is an underrated presence, a guy who when given material to shine in does very well as an everyman, more than just a typical pretty star. With his role as the on-his-way-out cop, he gives one of his best performances, worn and weary, but strong and good as a cop whenever he can see fit, who at one point makes a mistake that he won't cop to (watch Gere when he's interrogated about his rookie's mishap on a convenience store scuffle and it's something of genius work). It's intense and believable, and even tender and sorrowful work, like when Gere's character is around a prostitute he's fallen for. Back to Fuqua though - this is a filmmaker who knows what he's working in, and wants to transcend it. Perhaps his idol for this kind of production was Sidney Lumet with his cop films: make something dramatic and tragic, and never lose the grit, but add panache with the directing. He knows the conventions and has to stick to them, sometimes for weaker or just expected effect. But watching his style in that last reel, when all three stories that have been going back and forth (ocassionally intertwined) come together at one project building. There's a scene where Hawke is personally raiding a place. Watch the camera in this scene, where it stays put in one spot for seemingly a minute. It could almost be a Tarantino move, something self-conscious but purposeful for the action, the psychology of the emotion of the scene. His work with better material would be astonishing. As it is, it's just good, inventive film-making.",
         "Would you steal bread to feed your family? As Dwight from The Office would say, \"it's a trick question. The bread is poisoned. Also, it's not your real family. You've been cuckolded by a stronger, smarter male.\" For Sal (Ethan Hawke), a dirty narcotics officer in Brooklyn's Finest, the answer is clear. Only instead of bread, he is stealing drug money and killing anyone who gets in the way. He needs the money because his pregnant wife is sick from the mold in their home so he needs to pay the down payment on another house he is going to buy. Hawke plays the role with great intensity, just as he did in director Antoine Fuqua's previous movie, Training Day. In that he co-starred with Denzel Washington, only Denzel was the dirty cop, and Hawke played the rookie officer who didn't like what he saw. He got an Oscar nomination for that role, but is just as good, if not better, in this movie. Sal is just one of the three conflicted cops who walk a fine line between cop and criminal. One is Eddie (Richard Gere), who is days away from retirement, and has what is probably the most eventful week of his career. His job is to oversee rookies in the mean streets, and sticks a gun in his mouth a couple of times throughout the course of the movie. His only sources of pleasures are his whiskey and frequent visits with a hooker. The other is Tango (Don Cheadle), an undercover cop who is so deep into the criminal life that he struggles with his own identity. He's been asking for a desk job for years and desperately wants out of the drug beat. The only way he can get out and receive a promotion is by betraying a close criminal friend, Caz (Wesley Snipes). The problem with movies like Brooklyn's Finest is that they often fail to add any depth to their characters in the midst of all the mindless violence. But the great acting from Hawke, Gere, and Cheadle separates this one from the crowd, and makes it a watchable action thriller. And while may not be as good as Training Day, it still shows the rough side of being a cop, and that they may not be as innocent as they appear to be.",
         "Let me just say straight away that the cast of this movie contains ALL of my favorite actors. I thought I was going to be in for a treat, maybe my expectations ruined my conclusions. The biggest problem with this film (in my worthless opinion) is that it is portrayed as dramatic and yet there just seem to be soooooo many holes in the plot that the overall impact is reduced, almost to the point of being farcical. I won't give anything away but I don't believe that 'gangsters' are THAT stupid, I watched the TV show 'The Wire', which I thought was excellent due to it's balanced perspective. This film portrays the cops as being crooked, lifeless and aggressive morons whilst the 'gangster' are simply gun toting foul mouthed idiots who struggle to walk upright, let alone be career criminals. By the time the final scene began I found myself struggling to stay awake because the 'drama' had become so Tepid and predictable. Very very average.",
         "In Brooklyn, New York, the veteran policeman Eddie (Richard Gere) is a bitter and disillusioned lonely man that will retire in seven days. The catholic dirty detective Sal (Ethan Hawke) is a family man in despair that needs to raise money to buy a better house for his family. The undercover detective Tango (Don Cheadle) is affected by the long period he has been working infiltrated in gangs and has requested to be transferred to an office. Their lives and fates are entwined when Eddie retires and sees a missing girl that has been kidnapped by sex traffickers and he has to take a decision; Sal has to make the down payment of the dreamed house and he does nit have enough money; and Tango is assigned to frame the drug lord Caz (Wesley Snipes) that saved his life years ago and has become his friend. \"Brooklyn's Finest\" is a gloomy and bitter police story with a cast that is a constellation of stars, some of them with minor parts. I watched this film with great expectations, but unfortunately the screenplay is not original, too long and sometimes confused. The three stories are very well known by viewers of this genre and the narrative is cold, without emotions. The director Antoine Fuqua could (or should) have made a better feature with the available budget and cast. My vote is six. Title (Brazil): \"Atra√≠dos Pelo Crime\" (\"Attracted by the Crime\")",
         "Gritty, profane, and extremely violent thriller centering around three disparate New York cops: a cynical twenty-year veteran playing out his final days until retirement while struggling to keep his sanity (Gere); a conflicted undercover torn between his commitment to the job and his loyalty to the streets (Cheadle); a desperate family man who has his morale put to the test while trying to provide a stable home for his wife and kids (Hawke); director Fuqua's attempt at a police morality tale is well-crafted, strongly acted, and sure to grab your attention with intense, in-your-face violent action, but it doesn't offer enough new insight to transcend the familiar, seen-it-all-before limitations of this genre. Hawke (reteaming with his Training Day director) stands out with an unexpectedly edgy performance. The violenceÔøΩwhile expected for a film of this genreÔøΩis still tough to stomach at times. **¬Ω",
         "Draws you right in from the start, builds tension to a climactic point late in the film. In the middle, you get to absorb a lot of NYC atmosphere which somewhat compensates for the formulaic nature of the film. You've seen it all before, there's no new ground, but its done in a way that will hold your interest. Grim, adult movie themes highlight only the heavy issues that burden cops in this big city. Cheadle, Hawke and Gere all develop very burnt-out, empty looks in their eyes that help make this film more believable than it really is. Lives have fallen apart (the personal lives of these cops). The script makes it clear that the job is rough on cop families, it makes this point almost to the point of overkill. The women of this film are resigned to the belief that \"its a man's world\". They have bought this belief system almost totally. And yes I include Ellen Barkin's middle-aged super-boss-cop because she tries to be just like men in order to get to the top of this man's macho cop world/underworld environment. Gere is subtle, very nuanced and effective in his role. Hawke is incredibly explosive in his role of a man desperately overstrung, or at least in need of a good vacation. Cheadle's mixed-up about-to-snap performance works perfectly with Snipes who gives a fine, mature, theatrical style performance. I'm ready to see more of the mature Snipes as his career progresses. All the acting here is great and it overcomes the generally \"seen it before\" nature of the production. This is basically similar to Greek tragedy, so if you view it that way you won'be let down by the relentless grimness that is here from start to finish. Entertainment value highlighted by enough tension, plus the studied pro performances rate an 8 rating from me.",
         "The police corruption has been a recurrent subject in cinema from its beginnings.Classic films such as Scarface (1932) or The Asphalt Jungle reported the reality of the cops who are seduced by the easy way of crime, betraying the trust from the people and the law they swore to protect.However, in that times, the corrupt cops were the villains; but the perspective changed in the 70's thanks to movies like Shaft and Electra Glide in Blue, which showed that the ethic and the rectitude could become into obstacles in order to combat every time more violent and crafty criminals.We can suppose that those anti-heroes arose as a consequence of the dissatisfaction people felt with the authorities, and with the sad reality that the pure and incorruptible heroes of yesteryear were not credible anymore.Needless to say that real life has gotten worse in our century, and the cinema has adapted to that with films (and TV series) where the line between heroes and villains is every time more diffuse. All the previous paragraph takes me to Brooklyn's Finest, a cop flick in which director Antoine Fuqua runs a similar field to the one he visited in Training Day 9 years ago.The result is competent and interesting, but not highly memorable. Brooklyn's Finest has a provocative premise, and thanks to screenwriter Michael C. Martin, we have many interesting scenes of moral disjunctive, fights with the conscience and impossible decisions.But the problem is that that structure feels a bit diffuse, and I could not find the point in common which impulses the three stories this movie tells (besides of the ethical conflicts the three main characters face).In other words, I was interested in the characters and their dilemmas, but the secondary scenes which may add texture and \"realism\" to the story tired me a little bit, because they divide our attention without a justifiable cause and they unnecessarily stretch the movie. In spite of that, I liked the film, mainly because of Fuqua's solid direction, which is always disciplined and absolutely free of any tricks which are not necessary in order to create suspense.As for the cast, Ethan Hawke feels a bit over the top in his character, while on the other hand, Don Cheadle is perfect as a cop whose divided loyalty is not because of simple ambition, but because of the lessons life has brought him in both sides of the law.Richard Gere could interpret even asleep the character of a veteran who is tired of fighting an endless war, but I think he keeps doing it well.As for the supporting cast, I liked the performances from Will Patton as the classical \"suit\" who only wants results; Ellen Barkin as a cop/politician who is more interested in her career than in the fulfillment of justice; and Wesley Snipes, who makes his return to mainstream cinema after various years of starring in atrocious action movies made straight to DVD. As a comparison point, I liked Brooklyn's Finest more than Pride and Glory, but less than Narc and Dark Blue, because they had had more concise and compact screenplays.However, despite the fails from the screenplay and the fact it is not highly memorable, I can recommend Brooklyn's Finest as an interesting cop flick with good performances and interesting ideas."
