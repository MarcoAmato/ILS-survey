      "synopsis": "The film opens with a short text introduction stating the purpose of the footage and its intent \"For the fans...\". After short dialogues from various dancers, Kenny Ortega is heard talking through the original concert opening sequence involving a body suit made from screens which display fast clips and images with bright intensity from which Jackson emerges on stage. Immediately after this, Jackson begins \"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\" first solo, which pauses half-way through and a small snippet of Jackson singing his song \"Speechless\" acapella is shown. Jackson is then joined by dancers and completes the first number. A short clip showing rehearsals of the \"toaster\" mechanism is shown before rehearsal footage of \"Jam\" is played. This plays directly into the green screen adaption of soldiers dancers for \"Bad\" which are also used for \"They Don't Really Care About Us\" which is shown next. From here, the film shows Michael directing Ortega and his band for his solo rehearsal performance of \"Human Nature\" which he performs acapella, then acoustic and finally with full band. Green screen rehearsals for the video vignette for \"Smooth Criminal\" come next, with dress rehearsals of the song following, including parts of the vignette intertwined with the dancing. Jackson is seen next directing his musical team for the cues in his song \"The Way You Make Me Feel.\" Jackson then performs a rehearsal with dancers which he alters and changes as he goes. A small animatic introducing the Jackson 5 is shown afterwards, and Michael then rehearses \"I Want You Back\", \"The Love You Save\", \"I'll Be There\" and \"Shake Your Body.\" Jackson stops only to report problems with his earpiece. After this, Jackson sings with one of his back up singers on his duet song \"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\" in which he sings at full strength, directing his partner as he goes. The filming for the \"Thriller\" vignette is then shown with Jackson and Ortega watching with 3D glasses. Jackson is then seen rehearsing \"Thriller\" with the vignette intertwined like that in \"Smooth Criminal.\" During the dance sequence, puppets are suspended in the audience aisles while Jackson emerges from a robotic spider originally seen in the vignette. Jackson and Ortega rehearsing the cherry-picker is seen next, along with Jackson rehearsing \"Beat It.\" Jackson creates the ending he wants for the song, a long drum build up in which he tears off his jacket and burns it. Footage of the show's aerialists rehearsing to the instrumental of \"Who Is It\" is shown next, followed by the Jackson and his band rehearsing \"Black or White,\" in which he allows guitarist Orianthi Panagaris to take center stage to finish with a high guitar rift. The video-sequence for \"Earth Song\" is shown next, featuring a small girl who wanders through an abundant forest, falls asleep, and wakes up to find the forest destroyed by man. Jackson then performs the song both onstage and using the cherry-picker, with his voice being heard at the end telling of the dangers of Global Warming and the lack of reversible time left. Afterwards, Michael is seen conversing with Ortega, his dancers and band about the shows, trivial dance moves and his hopes for the concert series. He then performs a quick version of his song \"Billie Jean\" featuring an extra dance sequence. Michael is then seen talking to all crew members and wishing everyone the best for the London performances. At a sound check, Jackson performs \"Man In The Mirror\" with strong backing vocals. The film ends with Jackson with his arms extended on stage with the message: \"Michael Jackson King of Pop Love Lives Forever",

         "I haven't been since I was a kid. I therefore had zero expectations for this movie, and even groaned that I had to come in at 6 this morning to preview it for my theater. That said, I was completely blown away and entertained from beginning to end. His voice and his dance moves are top form and timeless. He sang all his greatest hits, even from the J5 era, which really hit a soft spot with me. And people might be complaining that this isn't a typical concert movie...in truth, that is a big plus here. Typical concert movies are overly produced. The intimacy of this footage makes you feel, not like you're in a concert, but like you're witness to very private performances. You get to see first hand how involved this man was (to every little detail of production and planning). There are no crowds of screaming and crying fans to have to sit through (with the exception of a brief opening scene in which the auditioning dancers get a little too blubbery at times). This film easily reignited my appreciation for the man, who was without a doubt one of the greatest entertainers of our time. Complete 180 for me, I'll be the first to admit. And a side note, his female guitarist (her name escapes me) had me picking my jaw up off the floor, and not just her looks. You'll see what I mean.",
         "I went to see this movie as a non-Michael Jackson fan with absolutely no expectations. I bought the tickets for the world premiere as a birthday gift for my girlfriend. We went to the cinema in the morning and from the beginning I was moved. I have never done it before but in the very beginning a tear came to my eye. Thinking that this guy, with so much energy is 50 years old and about to die. When I bought the tickets I expected a movie with some biography of Michael, a lot of interviews etc, but there is none of this in the movie. The whole movie is about how the concerts would be, but I still didn't feel like I was seeing a concert. I was seeing a little family making a big project come true. I also expected to see Michael less weak, than some of his others concerts, but damn.. If you didn't know he was dead, and saw him dance and sing like he does there is no way you could predict that he was about to die of illness. There was no way I wanted to pay for tickets to his concerts before this day, but now I would pay 500$ for seeing those concerts in London. Although that This is it was about the concerts, the movie also consist a little sense of humor, love and a insight to the worlds climate problems. A really great job, with great cutting and editing. This movie is a must see for everyone! Even though you aren't a fan of Michael, go watch it!",
         "Forget everything you think you know about Michael Jackson. Forget the scandals, the surgeries, the rumors, the mysteries. Just accept that we're all innocent until proved guilty in America and let it all go. Michael Jackson was the greatest dancer in the history of mankind. This documentary shows that hours before his death, he remained the greatest dancer in the history of mankind. He was a revelation, pure and simple. And the greatest achievement in Kenny Ortega's simple, elegant tribute is that it allows the viewer, without a shred of distraction, to witness the process of an artist. Sure, some of the footage is a little amateurish, as this was meant for Michael Jackson' records more than anything else. But that's the fun of it. The viewer gets to witness the raw nature of the artist rather than the glossy outcome that would have been the final product. If you're concerned that the film will be an act of gross exploitation and an attempt to squeeze every last dime in the wake of Michael Jackson's death, know this: I haven't the slightest doubt that Michael would have wanted his fans to see this footage. Of course it's exploitive, don't fool yourself into thinking otherwise, but so what: All documentaries are exploitive to some degree and tasteful exploitation is better than tasteless exploitation. This is a film about the process, nothing more. We're just lucky that this process happens to revolve around the finest entertainer of our time. If you're even the slightest fan, this is a must see. If you're not, I dare you not to be won over. Also, if you're looking for signs of fatigue from Michael Jackson, you will be disappointed. In fact, if there's one thing that bothered me about the film, it's that Michael was in such terrific shape that it's angering to think he died so close to the finish line. We don't have many great entertainers left in the world. And the fact that at 50 years of age, operating at about 80% energy wise, Michael blows the top 10 pop singers of today out of the sky, is rather remarkable. Prepare for an emotional and downright exciting concert-film. \"This is it\" will show the world that with all the noise, all the distractions, all the craziness: Michael Jackson still had it. And then some...",
         "I had my fear going in, but it was all shattered. What a blast. This is a must-see for every MJ fan and even non-fans to understand why he was so popular and deserved every bit of the title King of the Pop. A consummate artist, a perfectionist, and a visionary. The film is overflowed with his energy, passion, and dedication. If the rehearsals could be this good and engaging, one could only imagine what the concerts would've been. His voice sometimes showed his age, but his dance moves were not, at all. Also the young female guitarist was not just good looking, but crazily good with the guitar as well. Smooth Criminal segment is probably my favorite, but they're all very excellent. I don't feel the film is exploiting his death in any way. It's simply paying the tribute and gives fans something they deserve to see.",
         "This was a clear view into the intergral preperation of a concert by a complete genius. I was never a Michael Jackson fan, however, my wife was and since she was desperate to see the film I decided to accompany her. I was astounded. I could not believe this man in the film was the same person that is was always hounded by the press and made to look like the devil. He was by no means weird, ill health, or a drug user. If he was, he masked it very well. The film shows us what we are missing as far as the concert goes and what a pity, it would have been amazing! He seemed at ease, and so happy and normal while on stage, as if it was built to be his. You would never believe this was the ''freak'' that the world perceived him to be. Shame on those people. Genius at work, a perfectionist down the smallest detail and I think the film has captured this very well. What I liked a lot was the fact that the film was not concentrating on his death and tradegy, but solely on his concert, his music, and his geniality and it was a fitting tribute to one of the greatest musicians of our times. So I would urge anyone who has had any miss conceptions about the man to go see this, you like me will more than likely change your views on the man. RIP",
         "No one has any apology to make about this wonderful documentary, least of all Kenny Ortega. When I heard he intended to take \"rehearsal\" footage of the \"This Is It\" tour and market it as a film, I assumed it was an attempt to recoup the investment made in the project. Who could have guessed that this film would stand on its own and also enter the echelons of the \"best\" documentaries about rock music ever made? No less, Michael Jackson reveals more about himself in this footage than we've ever seen before. It's his premiere moment on film, and I would guess he would not have wanted it shown only because we see�for the first time�Jackson without a mask. I won't attempt to characterize this complicated, insanely talented, person, but basically he's painfully shy. And he excelled at one of the most public vocations there is: performing. What's interesting about the footage is that it exists at all. But since concerts today use video projection for the large venues where they play, it was natural to include the cameras during the rehearsal period. And it's riveting! Nothing is ever less than compelling in large part due to the level of talent in all quarters. The dancers, the musicians, the back-up singers, sets, costumes�it's a parade of the best of the best. While Jackson is the center of all of this, if you don't care for him, there's plenty of other things to look at and enjoy. Any sadness is brought by the viewer. There's not one nod to Jackson's demise or when it occurs. He looks thin, but even in a rehearsal mode, he's electrifying, and I think that's why the film works. We're not at some huge arena (for which the concert was conceived) with 10,000 screaming fans. And rather than missing that electricity, we get intimate performances of familiar Jackson material. But it's re-imagined and you never know what's coming next. An alert: there is footage throughout the final credit sequence and after the credits end. And if you can, see it in a DP theater...for the sound alone. An amazing experience!",
         "Just came back from screening of this movie. I went with very low expectation but it was really great movie. Lots of MJ songs and practice sessions. His female guitarist was out of the world, simply superb. I wish they had shown or MJ has performed some more of his stunts (moon walk, dance stunts etc etc)... so deducted 1 star for this... MJ was so humble, I dint expect that from such a big start... I m really impressed with his behavior towards his troop :) I m not a big MJ fan.. and I was totally amazed by editing and quality of movie... I m pretty sure MJ fans would love this.... Hats off to MJ ... RIP....",
         "My wife asked me to see this movie tonight as sort of a preview,to let her know if we should see it together on our day off.As we are both Michael Jackson fans,I would have to give an emphatic \"YES\" to that.I was really apprehensive,since I thought that it would just be some rehearsals with tons of filler(biographical info,etc),but most of the numbers were pretty fleshed out,music and choreography wise.Some of the special effects were amazing,and I really liked the extended intro of \"The Way You Make Me Feel\".I liked the way they tried to make the film feel like a performance,rather than a eulogy.The talent,from the dancers to the musicians to the lighting and effects crew were just first rate all the way.I thought beforehand that this might be just a cynical cash grab-one more trip to the ATM from Michaels legacy,but honestly,I think they may just be trying to recoup some of the enormous costs of putting on a show that never came to fruition.And if some of us fans can enjoy seeing MJ one more time in such a classy way,Im all for it.",
         "I saw This Is It today and all i can say is that it is fitting for the man Michael. That will say more than anything else about how well done this movie is. It makes me sad when i see what a fantastic production this could've been to know that the world never got a chance to see it. But i know it would've been amazing, that's more than enough for me. For the film it is basically all of his biggest hits that would've been performed in the shows on the big screen instead. It's just rehearsal but he's still amazing in them. Between each song you got some insight into the bigger picture of the shows themselves, and sometimes you'd even get to see Michael as himself. Michael you were truly one of God's greatest gifts to those of us lucky to be alive now. R.I.P",
         "Just came from seeing the movie and plan to go and see it again soon, probably tomorrow. I am a MJ fan since I was 10. I hope I was going to be cry but I was just admiring the priceless piece of work in front of me. There was so much creativity, sweetness, professionalism, understanding, effort, energy in that film that didn't leave me any chance of crying. The professionalism and patience of ortega was outstanding, he was perfect for this whole production, the cast was phenomenal, MJ was awesome. Come on! 50 years old and dancing, singing like that? Absolutely amazing. This movie deserves to be seen over and over. My final thought: Michael Jackson will be forever the king of pop and music and he did really give us a final precious work...\"this is it\"."

         "In the weeks before his death, Michael Jackson (August 29, 1958 - June 25, 2009) was rehearsing a show, \"This Is It,\" that was to open in July. This film begins with a few of the auditioning dancers speaking to the camera about why they're trying out and what Jackson means to them. Then we plunge into rehearsals at Staples Center in Los Angeles. The film is arranged by musical number with pre-recorded material and footage from Jackson's various rehearsals edited together to take us through what would have been the concert's set list.",
         "In 2008 Michael Jackson announced a history-making epic comeback that wouldn't be topped for decades to come. Calling the shows \"This Is It\", he booked 50 back to back dates at London's O2 Arena that sold out in a matter of mere minutes. And he certainly wasn't about to disappoint - pulling in a budget for these shows that would rival most feature films and set about updating his classics from \"Smooth Criminal\", \"The Man In The Mirror\", \"Human Nature\", \"Beat It\", and of course \"Thriller\" for the modern era. This movie consists of the rehearsal footage of the full set - with a tight back up band and dancers, and some really amazing video sequences and pyrotechnics - that was to be performed at the O2. However - not even the week before his tragic death of an overdose on June 25th, 2009, the band, the crew, and Michael himself were a week away from going to London to pull off the epic comeback. Instead the footage that exists from the rehearsals is only a sad reminder of what could have been: This Is It.",
