         "content": "**The message is to we be alert all time, no matter how friendly the society is.**\r\n\r\nThis is like an extended version of 'Prisoners'. Sets in a small snowy Canadian town where a ten year old girl was mysteriously disappeared and so the film focused on the life of her parents who are eager to see her even after 8 years past. The cops and parents, hopelessly look for any clue of her being alive. Happy or sad ending, that's what the film's conclusion decides. Maybe the director was inspired to make this by his previous film, which was similar and based on the real, but that ends differently.\r\n\r\nFilms like this scares if you are a family man. But I think if we keep watching them at the time of it comes out, it is to alert us about our family security lapse. No matter whatever the country is, how safety it is, as they say, still thing like this happens in an eye blink time. The film is really something big, I wanted to like it, but they did not make the film right.\r\n\r\nNot a bad film, only badly made, that's all. The characters, the concept had potential and the development ruined it everything. Nearly 75 per cent of the film was a drag. Everything we wanted to know is in first 15 and the last 30 minutes. In between, they have wasted in the name of development, hence the film failed to impress as what it promised, not from the message perspective and that's the point.\r\n\r\nNot all the actors were good, particularly Ryan Reynolds was the best. The remaining ones were okay, though Rosario Dawson was the next best thing in the film. I did not like the presentation, it was so random to move from and forth between in the 8 years time span, it totally messed the film. Not only confuses the viewers, it gained nothing from it. Because usually this kind of narration method used to bring twist and turns and audience to keep guessing till the final, but in this case, it did not work at all. Other than that the film was better than it was criticised, I still suggest it for the adults because of the film theme.\r\n\r\n_6/10_",

         "This is the last time I take into consideration negative reviews + a low rating. I was very undecided about going to see this movie due to this bad habit of reading reviews on IMDb. It is not the first time a low rated movie turns out to be great, but it is certainly the greatest contrast between reviews and the actual movie. This just proves that most users are probably persons who don't understand a well constructed narrative and don't have an eye for beautiful cinematography. Ryan Reynolds does a great job and so do his co-stars. I also admire Mr. Atom Egoyan for writing, directing and producing this movie. It is a good movie. Go watch it and don't let the rating create low expectations. Hopefully it will exceed the current 5.8.",
         "I'm a big movie bro man guy. Before I delve into a movie I first look at the IMDb rating, read the summary, and then read the reviews. The summary of the movie interested me but I did not have high hopes given the 5/10 rating. Watching this film, I was actually very entertained. I was hanging on the edge of my seat with my eyes glued to the screen. Right off the rip, the film lets you know what happens to the little girl and who the captor is. The entire movie is the parents working with what seems like the best pedophile detectives ever assembled looking for their daughter. The movie does this Pulp Fiction thing with the past and the present scenes flipping and flopping back and forth to tell the story. No where near Pulp Fiction level, but the film gets the job done telling the story with it. Viewing this movie it seemed more like a 7 rather than a 5/10. Until the final 15 minutes... Once the climax has hit I like a film to build its ending to a fulfilling satisfying conclusion. Once the end had arrived everything was slammed at you instantly and \"Voila!\", movie done. I'm not even exaggerating either. There was no build up or suspense to it at all. I can't be remotely descriptive without completely spoiling it. Poor finish to what could have been a good 7.5 film. The potential was there, the delivery was strong but poor finish. The acting performances were \"good\". Nothing award worthy or anything, but the cast did \"good\". Except for Ryan Reynolds. I mean he could have at least tried a little harder to actually look like a devastated father who just lost his only daughter not knowing if she is dead or alive. Instead he looked more like a father who just lost his daughter at a Chuck E. Cheese's for 2 hours who was actually hiding in the ball pit the whole time...",
         "It should be a telling indicator when a movie studio releases a movie online the same time they release it in the theaters. It means the studio knows it's a bomb, and is going to try and get the most money they can out of it, through all mediums, before the negative reviews take hold. Well, it worked, and they got my $5.99. Ugh. Movie has the potential to be something gripping, but instead it just slugs along. In other films, showing scenes out of sequence is done for specific impact or effect. Here it's done as a gimmick - \"Hey, how about we show this part here, and then just for the hell of it, show an earlier part next, and then something from the middle after that...\" Give me a break. It serves absolutely no purpose, and only further confuses, frustrates, and angers the audience. Some of the acting is well done, but it's not enough. The creepy child abductor character is practically wearing a \"creepy child abductor\" Halloween mask, and yet he shuffles through this entire movie with nobody suspecting a thing. The relationship between the male/female detective leads is awkward, and never fully explained. The secondary members of the detective team are introduced with specific \"gifts\", only to be essentially never seen again (never mind showing how their \"gifts\" are relevant to the story). I've never written a review here before, but this is such a clunker, I just couldn't help myself. I cringe as some others are comparing this to Hitchcock. Lord, have ya seen Hitchcock? Cause this crap ain't even close.",
         "Don't read any of the reviews, I don't understand why the hate. It was a pretty decent movie, had some plot holes but very much watchable and you'll definitely like it if u watch with an open mind. A father looking for her kidnapped daughter is not something new but its not a typical movie where the father just goes berserk and kills off all the bad people. The father just acts like a normal average person would. It is not as good as prisoners was but definitely doesn't deserve to be rated so low. The story moves back and forth which i find is pretty cool, but some people might not like it as it can be a little confusing at times. The acting is superb and the movie is a little slow to start off but overall, i would definitely recommend this movie!! Watch for yourself and decide!",
         "This one is all on the Director. I don't know what he was trying to accomplish but it failed miserably. The basic outline of the story showed a lot of promise but it never came together. Its funny that one of the reoccurring lines in the dialog between the father and daughter focused on the word \"gimmick\" because it seemed as if the director tried to fit every story telling gimmick he could think of into this film. The result is a horribly told story. Constantly confusing. Disjointed. Lacking any depth - you couldn't connect with any of the characters. The story had no pace. You spend your time trying to figure out what's going on....then asking yourself, why did they do that...and then constantly hoping they can manage to pull their stuff together, only to be disappointed in the end. The actors were a talented group. I can't imagine how frustrating it must have been for them being stuck in this slow motion train wreck.",
         "This is a slow paced thriller about a girl who was kidnapped at the age of 9 and kept in captivity in a basement for 8 years. The story follows the implications of her kidnapping for her parents and the local police division that never stopped looking for her. The nature of the kidnapper and his motives is expressed right from the beginning, but you may miss some of them because of a somehow confusing time-line of events and narrative. Later everything will be presented even more clearly but numerous plot holes will annoy you and ruin the experience of the movie. The acting is sub-par and the cast far from suitable. Ryan Reynolds is like a fish out of the water and fails to find his place in the movie from the start. Kevin Durand is a caricature of a master villain and Scott Speedman (as one of the police detectives) acts more annoyingly than the kidnapper himself. Overall \"The captive\" fails to captivate the audience with a premise that in general it could produce an interesting movie about a delicate subject...",
         "At the beginning, you sense great possibilities and the plot looks exciting; then, flop down!!! To start, there is no connection between the mother working as a housekeeper and the rest of the story about a girl locked up. You figure it out and join the dots.WHY?? Why can't the story be told smoothly? The rest is a bunch of little stories put together with the only connection being that you see the same actors so, in your mind, you figure it out and fill the holes. Why? Another example, Rosario's big poster is shown at the beginning with no explanation whatsoever while Vince looks at it pensively. Who is she? a dead wife? A sister/cop killed in action? Mystery! Later on, you see Rosario but there is no connection between all of that and the charity event. Suddenly, Jeffrey and Nicole are kissing and seem to be having a relationship whereas, in the previous scene, he is just joining the force. When did that happen? You only discover that 8 years have passed in their casual conversation. And this goes on and on. There are so many holes you could have played cartoons during the movie. Like I said, there was a great possibility but somebody goofed big time.",
         "Throughout the movie, I kept thinking...\"something please happen\". All of the pieces were there, good actors, good director, probably a script. And there were so many avenues they could have taken with it. Something with her ice skating friend, something with the mom, something with the cousin that got arrested. But everything about this movie was just so convenient that I wanted to puke. It starts out with the girl getting taken out of a vehicle and there's no tire tracks, no footprints, nothing for the police to use to corroborate the main character's story. So the main character becomes the police's main suspect instead of looking for anyone else (right). The kidnapper happens to have some work relation to the main detective who just so happened to be kidnapped when she was a girl (but they never really go into that). And the kidnapper is also able to hack into specific computer cameras and setup cameras so he and the kidnap victim can watch everyone (but how or why he does this isn't clear). And he also decides on a whim to let his kidnap victim see her dad after 8 years (potentially screwing up his whole kid molesting operation). The main character brings a truck load of trees to a job, when he's told to hang onto them until the next day and stay at a motel overnight, but the kidnapper just so happens to know where and when the main character is going to be, then steals the trees and uses them like bread crumbs to lead him to his kidnap victim (if it was me, I would have thought my trees were just stolen, not this guy though). When she sees her dad, the kidnap victim conveys in code to go check out her old ice skating partner, just as he does, some random lady that shows up late in the story just so happens to be conducting a bullshit interview with the kid after 8 years on a cellphone to show the kidnapper later (but his and her relationship aren't well defined either except for some hint that she may have also been a kidnap victim earlier in the movie). Then the main character just so happens to steal the phone that she was recording on causing him to be chased (but could have just as easily not done that and let the car drive back to the house where they were keeping his daughter). The entire movie is like this. Crazy unnecessary actions that just so happen to happen, who wrote this nonsense! Its supposed to be deep but just ends up shallow!",
         "I was hoping for something awesome like the original The Vanishing, but I have to say the poster was the only good thing about this D grade film. honestly... this film is like Disney made a movie about a pedo ring. I kept thinking there must be a twist but no, it really was just. that. bad. The main villain is totally implausible and about as threatening as a butterfly. The parents' delivery of grief is tawdry and inadequate. And the 2 hot detectives are the icing on the cake to make this a barely acceptable TV movie. There are just so many conveniently unexplained holes in this film, which surely only serve to a cover up for a really poorly written story with even worse casting. I signed up to IMDb just to share with you all not to waste your hard-earned money on this.",
         "This movie has a good concept and the initial ground work is there. Problem is they jump from past to future without the viewer realizing it in many instances so it gets confusing trying to keep the story line straight (all they needed to do was add a year or something to the bottom corner of the screen). A few scenes do not make sense leading up to the finish of the movie as it is confusing if your are watching past or current events unfolding. Ryan Reynolds basically made this a decent movie with his acting skills, the rest of the cast are kind of annoying to watch. All said, what really made me positive I would never watch this again is that it just goes from being at a pinnacle point that they could have built up a huge amount of suspense and finished with a bang to a quick non suspenseful ending that just closed a few loose ends and ended the movie."
