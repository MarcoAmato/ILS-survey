      "synopsis": "This film is the story of a young woman's rise to success and the unconventional road she took to get there. Tess McGill ( Melanie Griffith) is a secretary trying to get ahead at her Manhattan financial conglomerate. She is 30-years-old and earned her college business degree at night school. She rides the Staten Island Ferry to work every day which is a large corporation called Petty Marsh. Her goal is to move out of the secretarial pool and into an executive position. Yet, her dream remains unrealized; because her education was not acquired at a prestigious school, she cannot gain entry to her firm's training program for recent college graduates. She reads everything she can get her hands on, and endures the too-often falsely dangled opportunities of her superiors. After being misled into thinking that her supervisor, David Lutz ( Oliver Platt), is helping her get a better job, Tess finds herself set up with a lascivious and debauched colleague of Lutz, named Bob Speck ( Kevin Spacey) who tries to seduce her in his private limousine. She is forced to run out of the limo onto the street to get away from Speck. An angry Tess returns to the office and then gets into trouble by publicly calling her boss a \"sleazoid pimp with a tiny little dick\" on the office's digital stock-ticker crawl display. Following this, Tess is reassigned as a secretary to a new financial division for Petty Marsh and goes to work for company's new mergers executive, Katherine Parker ( Sigourney Weaver), who is two weeks younger than she and the first woman she's ever worked for. Katherine assures her that their relationship is a two-way street and offers to mentor Tess. Seemingly supportive and benevolent, Katharine encourages Tess to share any good business ideas she has. Tess is delighted to finally be getting somewhere much to the chagrin of her live-in boyfriend, Mick Dugan ( Alec Baldwin), whose main ambition is to buy his own fishing boat and doesn't understand the time Tess spends in Speech and Management classes that she attends on the weekends since Tess still speaks with the voice of a 10-year-old girl. Tess presses on, despite Mick's indifference and the bewilderment of her best friend Cynthia ( Joan Cusack), who is engaged herself, and doesn't understand why Tess doesn't just marry Mick. Tess tries to explain to Cynthia that her career comes first. Over the next few days, Tess observes Katherine's style, ease with power, and smooth handling of the lecherous men who seem to populate their world. One day, Tess comes to Katherine with an idea for one of the firm's clients. Trask Industries has expressed interest in acquiring television stations, but Tess says that her research shows Trask would be better served to acquire radio instead. Katherine quizzes Tess on the genesis of this idea and, once she's convinced it really is Tess' own, sends her on her way with promises to bring it up at the next meeting. Tess is elated. As Katherine prepares for a getaway ski weekend to Europe with her estranged boyfriend, she confides to Tess that she's sure this is the weekend he'll pop the question. Katherine learns that Jack can't join her skiing but decides she should have a good time anyway... and promptly breaks her leg while skiing down a slope. She calls Tess from her hospital bed with a flurry of instructions: answer invitations, inform people that she'll be incapacitated, and take care of things at Katherine's parents house in New York as well. She apologizes for leaving such a mess, but reassures Tess that she can \"make it happen.\" Tess arrives at Katherine's family's elegant Manhattan townhouse and soaks up the life she wants for herself. She sits at Katherine's make-up table, uses her exercise equipment, and imitates recordings of Katherine's upper-crust cadence. Then she finds a memo Katherine recorded for herself about Tess' idea for Trask Industries. She checks Katherine's home computer and, sure enough, finds more evidence that Katherine is intending to pass off Tess' idea as her own. Tess returns home to Staten Island, crushed at Katherine's betrayal, only to find Mick engaging in a worse betrayal; having sex with another woman, whom is one of her friends named Doreen DiMucci ( Elizabeth Whitcraft). Disillusioned with Katharine and disgusted with Mick (whom she calls a \"snake\"), Tess walks out into the night. Having nowhere else to go, Tess runs back to Katherine's house to shack up there. Cynthia brings Tess her clothes from the apartment and begs her to talk to Mick, but Tess has decided to take action. She sees Katherine's invitation for a party that night from Dewey Stone & Company, which Katherine had intended to bring in on the Trask deal. In a bold move, Tess sets up a meeting for the following morning with Jack Trainer of Dewey Stone (the radio expert that Katherine had mentioned in her memo) and accepts the invitation to the party herself. She and Cyn go to Katherine's to borrow a $6,000 dress for the party; and, at Cyn's suggestion to calm herself, she takes one of Katherine's Valium. With Cyn's help, Tess remakes herself and attends the party looking different but still feeling slightly out of place. Once at the Dewey Stone party, she realizes how remote are her chances of finding Jack Trainer ( Harrison Ford), and getting a head start with him before their meeting has decided to leave; but a handsome stranger approaches and asks her to have a drink with him. Tess asks the stranger if he knows Jack Trainer; and, of course, the stranger is Jack Trainer, who conceals his identity from Tess. After a few drinks, Tess realizes how intoxicated she is and should leave and asks the stranger to please get her coat for her. He brings the coat to an incoherent Tess in a waiting cab and instructs the driver to take them to his place. Once there, he carries the now totally unconscious Tess up to his apartment and puts her to bed. The next morning Tess awakens, thinking the worst, and moves as fast as she can to get out of the apartment before having to deal with the sleeping stranger beside her. She escapes with seconds to spare and regains her focus for her meeting at Dewey Stone. Draped in one of Katherine's stunning suits, she quickly realizes that the handsome stranger from the night before was Jack Trainer. He and his colleagues praise her idea for Trask's acquisition of a radio network but are curious why (1); she's come to them, and (2); has no briefcase. She gives them a plausible story on both counts, and they agree to meet further within their company and let her know if they can be part of the deal. Back at Tess'--no, Katherine's--office, Tess is cursing her own bad judgment concerning men and alcohol; and Cynthia is cursing Tess' double life, warning that she'll be out of, not only her man and her home, but her job as well. Suddenly, Jack appears on the floor, asking to see Tess. Tess convinces Cynthia to pose as her secretary and meets with Jack. After Tess' questions about the previous night, Jack assures her that nothing untoward occurred and that Dewey Stone is ready to proceed on the Trask deal. He gives her a gift of a new briefcase to celebrate and invites her to dinner; but she declines in spite of the attraction growing between them. Now the frenzy of activity kicks into high gear: Tess playing her role as Katherine's secretary for Katherine when she calls and for everyone else at her company and the role of deal manager with Jack Trainer. They work well together, making it fun and flirty when they can. When Tess attends Cynthia's engagement party, she realizes how much she's changed in a short time, how she no longer fits into the world she once called home. After Mick's impulsive marriage proposal, Tess says good-bye to him for good. A few days later, Tess and Jack crash Oren Trask's ( Philip Bosco) daughter's ( Barbara Garrick) wedding, intending to make an appointment and pitch their plan. They succeed and meet with two of his executives. Trask is interested. After a successful meeting with Trask, Tess and Jack sleep together for the first time. The next morning, Jack confesses that he needs to break up with his girlfriend. For him it's already over, he just hasn't told her yet. Tess' disappointment is evident when she learns the mystery girlfriend is Katherine and decides to keep her identity as Katherine's secretary a secret. Everything begins to come to a head: Katherine is returning to Manhattan the same day Tess and Jack are scheduled to finalize with the principles of the Trask deal, including the owner of the radio network that Trask is acquiring. Tess quickly cleans up and moves out of Katherine's house, dry cleans all Katherine's clothes, and meets her on the company's helipad when she arrives. At Katherine's house, she wastes no time drafting Tess to help her unpack, bathe, and change into sexy lingerie so that she can reconnect with the man she is so sure will propose to her. As Tess is about to leave on an errand to get painkiller pills for Katherine, she mentions to Katherine the memo she found that started the whole chain of events and points out that it looks like she's proffering the Trask radio idea as her own. Katherine claims that it was a necessary measure, since once Jack was accused of stealing another's idea. Katherine calls Jack to come over and, after a brief struggle during which Katherine proposes to him, he leaves without telling her about Tess. Tess returns from the errand and hides in a coat closet when she sees Jack. After Jack leaves, Tess emerges from the closet, gives Katharine her pills and rushes out of the apartment, accidentally leaving her appointment book behind. Katharine reads it and becomes enraged after she discovers what Tess has been up to for the past few weeks. Before entering the boardroom to finalize the Trask deal, Tess quickly asks Jack if he's ever had any ethical problems about looking over the work of others--he says he hasn't. The two confess their love for each other and sit down at the table. Suddenly, Katherine, on crutches, bursts into the room, screaming that Tess is an imposter and merely her secretary. Tess is unable to make the others understand that Katharine is the liar and leaves the meeting in shame. All the deal participants, including Jack, are confused. A few days later, Tess attends Cynthia's wedding where she finds that Mick is going on with his life with his new girlfriend, Doreen. After the wedding, Tess returns to her office to clean out her desk where the rest of her co-workers wish her the best of luck. In the lobby, she runs into Katherine, Jack, and Mr. Trask along with a group of executive businessmen. The women confront each other and get into a huge shouting mach in front of everyone. Katherine again play-acts as the \"poor innocent victim\" and accusing Tess of being a thief and liar (Note: the sociopath Katherine is basically describing herself by passing everything onto Tess using the old fashion 'accuse-your-accuser' manipulation tactic), while Tess accuses Katherine of pretending to be her friend so she could steal her ideas... as well as ploting to fire her on trumped-up charges after the deal goes through. When Jack intervenes in the argument, Tess tells him that her impersonating an executive may have stared out that way, but everything else she told him, as well as their night together, was true and that Katherine was always the bad person hiding behind her charming facade. Katherine whispers to Tess at what she told her earlier that \"it was all just business\". As the crafty and manipulative Katharine tries to lead the group onto the elevator, Jack then refuses to come, stating that Tess is this team's leader and he believes her. Trask tells Jack: \"you better not let your Johnson go on making business decisions for you.\" Katherine cautions Mr. Trask to ignore Tess and not to belive a word she say. Suddenly remembering a little tidbit about the Trask merger, Tess asks Trask if Katherine had told him about the potential dealbreaker. Tess explains about a conflict of intrest with a fellow Trask Industries client that could ruin the merger if it is to be made public within a week after the deal closes. Trask is stunned to hear Tess explain the potential loophole in the deal and realizes she may be telling the truth. Jack maneuvers himself, Tess, and Mr. Trask into an elevator alone; and Tess explains how she first conceived the idea for Trask to acquire radio and shows him the newspaper clippings that inspired her. When the elevator door opens again on the conference floor, Trask approaches Katherine and asks her where SHE got the idea for the deal? Katherine pretends not to remember and says that she needs to check her files in her office, but Trask refuses to let her go to her office and he again asks Katherine where she came up with the idea for the Trask Industries radio deal merger. Katherine tries changing the subject, and then says that it's complicated, but Trask tells her to uncomplicate it. When it quickly becomes clear to everybody present that Katherine cannot (and will not) provide an answer, Trask says he will insist to the Petty Marsh board of directors that she be fired for her deception. He then offers Tess a job at his firm if she promises to bring the passion and integrity she brought to his deal. A few days later, Tess moves in with Jack at his apartment and starts her first day of her new job at Trask Industries. When she arrives, she sees a woman in an office, talking on the phone, and presumes she is to be the woman's secretary. However, it is quickly revealed that the woman is, in fact, Tess new personal secretary Alice ( Amy Aquino), and Tess realizes that Trask's definition of \"entry-level\" involves the opportunities she had dreamed of. She insists her new secretary treat her as a colleague, rather than a superior, proving she is going be a very different boss from Katharine. Tess then calls Cynthia at her secretary job across town, to tell her the good news by saying: \"Guess where I am?\" Cynthia shouts to everyone that Tess has finally made it out of the typing pool.",

         "You know you've had a boss like this. Someone who stole your ideas, used you to advance their career, and did everything to keep you from getting the credit you deserve. I think of him every time I watch this movie, and although he got his come-uppance, as such people usually do, this one is still more satisfying. Griffith is a little annoying as the giggly secretary with ambition, but it works. Weaver is the greatest comedic villain since Cruella DeVil. You know she's going to fall, and she does in more ways than one. While she's mending broken bones from a ski trip, her secretary finds a memo capitalizing on her idea the boss had pooh-poohed as a \"secretary's notion.\" In her boss's absence, Tess (Griffith) uses her boss's name, her office, her home, even her clothes, to break into the rarefied New York mergers and acquisitions world. She even falls for the boss's boyfriend. Alas, the boss is a fast healer and comes home early. She finds an entry in her secretary's day planner, and it hits the fan. It's hard to believe this gem was written by the same writer who inflicted Meet Joe Black on us, but we can forgive him. Harrison Ford is at the top of his game as the boyfriend, but Joan Cusack almost walks away with this one, as usual. Joan is the best comedic supporting actress around. Weaver has one of the the greatest one-liners of all time. When asked if she's sure her boyfriend will propose, she says \"We're in the same city now. I've indicated I'm receptive to an offer. I've cleared the month of June. And I am, after all, me.\" The go-go 80's may be long gone, along with the power suits, the BIG hair, the Perrier, and the bull market, but this hilarious and heartwarming comedy still works without relying on nostalgia or sentiment!",
         "Watching Working Girl ten years after its release, it's hard not to dismiss it as a dated satire of the corporate world of the 1980's. At the same time, that's part of the movie's charm. Even though ten years has made the costumes, hair, and production design irritating, the charm and intelligence of Mike Nichols' Cinderella story still shine through. As does the quality of the performances, which are also revealing a decade later. Harrison Ford makes a perfectly likable romantic lead while Alec Baldwin and Kevin Spacey offer amusingly smarmy comic performances. But the actresses walk away with the movie. Joan Cusack is hilarious in a scene-stealing turn as a Staten Island secretary, and Sigourney Weaver is great as a shrewd and conniving career woman. The brilliance of Weaver's performance is how slyly and genuinely she plays her villianous character, often decieving the audience as she decieves the characters in the movie. And finally there is Melanie Griffith who gave a star-is-born performance as the big-haired secretary who falls in love with Ford's merger specialist and smartly climbs her way up the corporate ladder after Weaver stabs her in the back. Griffith earned an Oscar nod for this performance (as did Cusack and Weaver for theirs) and it's a testament to how funny, sexy, and wonderful she is in the part that even after numerous flops and odd career moves, she's still a well-known movie star ten years later (For an opposite side at this scenario look at Jennifer Beals in Flashdance or Jennifer Grey in Dirty Dancing, both of whom became big stars and then fell off the face of the earth). Nichols' direction is smart, as is Kevin Wade's clever screenplay, and the light and funny romantic comedy leads up to a surprisingly suspenseful and enormously satisfying climax. All-in-all, a satisfying and amusing entertainment.",
         "It's up there with any of screwball comedies of the 30s... Carole Lombard, Jean Arthur, Margaret Sullivan. a modern classic...and that's not hyperbole! I've been watching this movie every now and again for almost 20 years (ye gads!), and it's always entertaining. Tonight, I noticed how effective and subtle an actress Melanie Griffith can be when she's directed well. She's a real jewel in this film. Sweet, sexy, smart with a \"brain for business and a bod for sin\". Mike Nichols clearly loved filming her. Her expressions are priceless. Watch for the wonderful scene when Harrison Ford and she are walking to the elevator and he's asking her out. That face of hers as the elevator doors close is just heavenly. That's Mike Nichols craft/artistry. Sigourney Weaver also does a masterful job as a two-faced shark business woman. What's so wonderful about her character, the writing, is that Katherine doesn't have a conscience. She's crafty and slick and manipulative, but she's not out to hurt anyone, just put herself first. It's too bad if anyone get's in her way. She's not nasty, but there is no question that she is the most important person in the universe. It's interesting, too, how her duplicity is reflected in her wardrobe. Most of the professional women in the movie are dressed in ultra-conservative boxy business attire, but Katherine/Sigourney dresses sophisticatedly and elegantly. She knows how to play both sides, the professional yet still sexy professional. She's so powerful in herself that she doesn't feel like she has to dress like a man just because she's in a male- dominated career (mergers/acquisitions). yes, she's a monster/ogre, but as she states, \"This is BUSINESS\". Harrison Ford is his usual witty, slightly befuddled nice guy. He's the James Stewart of the baby boomer generation. Joan Cusack is a phenomenon with her iridescent eye-shadow and Bozo hairdo. I think has the funniest line in the movie-a warning to Tess: \"You know, sometimes I sing and dance around the apartment in my underwear. Doesn't make me Madonna....never will\". that's rich. Look for Ricki Lake at the wedding. I put this movie in the same category as Moonstruck, Educating Rita, Shirley Valentine. Transformation movies. I suppose you could call them modern day Cinderella Stories, but it's more about the women saving themselves as opposed to waiting for Prince Charming. It's a pleasure to see this movie. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.",
         "How can you go wrong with this delightful comedy? Besides having a great cast headed by Melanie Griffith, there's Harrison Ford (in one of the rare romantic comedies that suits his talents), Sigourney Weaver and wonderful Joan Cusack. And Olympia Dukakis, Alec Baldwin and Kevin Spacey are in it too (don't blink)! A great musical score and Oscar winning song by Carly Simon, all directed by Mike Nichols, I give this two thumbs up, and a 10!",
         "This is a fabulous movie. Maybe not rocket science, but clever enough! It has an engaging plot, an extremely empathetic heroine, a villainous boss, a cheatin' boyfriend, and a handsome new love interest just stepping into the picture. Get your popcorn ready for the comeuppance story of a lifetime. The tale revolves around a smart secretary named Tess McGill, who wants to get ahead in the Big Apple but is beaten down by her nasty boss, Katherine, who steals her ideas and passes them off as her own. Fortune smiles on Tess when Katherine breaks her leg during a skiing holiday and Tess is able to 'take charge'...that is, until her boss, who recovers all too quickly, returns. Of course there is also a romance brewing here in the form of a handsome investment banker named Jack Trainer, who just happens to be her boss's boyfriend. Harrison Ford is his typical dashing, magnetic self in the role of Jack Trainer, but it is the two ladies that make this movie. Signourey Weaver is absolutely villainous as an employee's 'worst nightmare' boss, a lady (no, not a lady) high up the corporate ladder, but lacking any semblance of integrity or kindness toward anyone below her in that ladder. You will be itching to see this nasty snob get her comeuppance. Above all, Melanie Griffith is brilliant in the role of Tess, every viewer's favorite downtrodden secretary. She's a woman with all the intelligence and skills needed to succeed in the corporate world, but is ill used by those above her who put her down. Many employees out there will identify with Tess, having at some point in their lives been ill treated by a boss, whether male or female, with at least shades of Katherine. Furthermore, Tess will surely gain viewer sympathy regarding her unfortunate experiences with her sleazy live in lover, Mick. The scene featuring the Staten Island ferry is beautifully done, accompanied as it is by Carly Simon's wonderful Oscar winning song, 'Let the River Run'. What an amazing voice! This is really a fantastic, fun movie. You can't help but love it.",
         "A pure fantasy served up by Mike Nichols, but a vastly entertaining one. Melanie Griffith is the secretary with massive hair who pretends to be a corporate business woman when her boss is layed up with a broken leg. The catch is, she finds out she's pretty good at it, and things get complicated when she ends up spearheading a business deal and falling in love with her key partner (Harrison Ford), all the while trying to keep what she's doing from her boss (Sigourney Weaver). It's the kind of movie that could just as easily have been made as a screwball comedy in the 1940s, perhaps with Barbara Stanwyck in the lead role. The film is a classic in its own small way, one of the best comedies to emerge from the 1980s. Griffith is matched well with her role, so her limitations as an actress don't draw too much attention to themselves. But it's Weaver who steals the show as Griffith's imperious boss. She's a riot as a confident and powerful career woman from hell. And Joan Cusack steals a few scenes of her own as Griffith's best friend and fellow secretary, who sports hair as big as Griffith's and a Joisy accent to boot. Nichols knows how to direct a comedy so that the funny bits speak for themselves. Grade: A",
         "With a cast that includes Melanie Griffith, Harrison Ford, Sigourney Weaver, Alec Baldwin, Oliver Platt and Kevin Spacey, its a minor miracle Joan Cusack got any attention at all. But she did get attention, and a well-deserved Oscar nomination. She is completely hysterical and is one of the best reasons to see this fairy tale set against the big bad world of Wall Street. Her best scene is when she masquerades as Melanie's secretary and makes an offer to Harrison \"Coffee, Tea, Me\"?",
         "I'm not a notable Melanie Griffith fan by any means but it must be said that she is brilliantly cast in the role of the small time heroine in the Big Apple. Harrison Ford is surprisingly effective as the hunk-on-a-stick; it is not surprising in the slightest bit that Sigourney Weaver is an effectively insidious megalomaniac bitch. This is also the first in a slew of flicks for Joan Cusack's long line of effective supporting girlfriends. Mike Nicholls is a sharp director and succeeds in not only capturing the look of the trapping and tawdriness of the free market explosion but also its unutterably tedious underbelly. Kevin Wade's script is the snappy dramatic and satirical motor at the film's heart to which Nicholls defers. A unimpeachable feelgood movie - although I can't help feeling a sorrow from Nicholls on behalf of his characters who, as in Billy Wilder's The Apartment remain trapped even after the happy ending. 7/10",
         "Right from the opening burst of Carly Simon's magnificent theme song, the audience is taken on a fairy-tale comedy ride with one working-class girl and her striving to get ahead in the competitive business world of New York's money market. Tess McGill (Melanie Griffiths) is a Staten Island Secretary working for a pair of sleazy bosses in an uptown New York shares company. Never once taking her astute business ideas seriously, they set her up with what she thinks is a job opportunity, but is really an opportunity for a lecherous colleague (a then unknown Kevin Spacey) to try and sleep with her. Angry, she publicly humiliates them and is fired but a sympathetic Personnel Director (Olympia Dukakis) puts her to work for a female boss Katherine Parker(Sigourney Weaver), who works in Mergers and Acquisitions. Although apparently helpful and sincere, Tess discovers her new boss has been stealing some of her ideas and claiming them as her own. When her boss is injured in a skiing accident, Tess takes over her office and sets about putting together a deal with one of her own ideas........ The acting is excellent on all fronts in this picture. Melanie Griffiths imbues her character with an increasingly confident but very genuine charm. Sigourney Weaver is perfect is her stuck-up, patronising superbitch of a boss. Harrison Ford is also on form here as the man in both their lives, a charming yet almost stuffy man who constantly fears losing his job. Odd, however, that he should receive top billing when he only appears about half-way through the film. The three leads are given tremendous support in the form of Joan Cusack as Tess's best friend who fears she is getting left behind in the wave of her friend's ambition. Other notable players include Nora Dunn as Katherine's snooty colleague and Philip Bosco as an industry tycoon, who gets the film's funniest line at the film's satisfying finale. The script by Kevin Wade is excellent, with plenty of funny one-liners and double-entendres. His portrayal of office life may seem a little bit too romantic at times, in spite of the rich business detail with which he imbues it, but this a comedy so this is entirely forgivable. The whole movie is wonderfully accentuated by a rousing score. Carly Simon's theme tune beautifully captures the film's themes of hope, ambition and fair play. Enjoyable and exhilarating comedy.",
         "Firstly let me say that I'm stunned at the mediocre rating this film has on this site, secondly I disagree with those users who say the film is too 80s and hasn't aged well because it's central theme fits into any time frame, it is in fact universal in life. On the surface the film appears to only operate purely as a romantic feel good movie, but scratch away the surface and you find that a great deal of intelligence is coursing thru the veins of this Mike Nichols effort. Dealing with the harshness of trying to get on in the world of business, I found that the film is saying that grit and determination can get you breaks if you have the brains to seize the opportunity, be strong and maybe you can prosper, now it may not always be the case that such endeavours are rewarded, but at least you can say you tried. A never better Melanie Grifith plays Tess McGill with much heart and passion, and I'm sure that is in no small part down to the adroit people skills that director Mike Nicholls obviously has. Sigourney Weaver & Joan Cusack are equally impressive, with Weaver seeming to relish the role of dastardly boss woman Katharine Parker, whilst Harrison Ford is simply spot on as the love interest with the smart business acumen helping Tess in her quest to make it in the often harsh world of business. A film with appeal for both sexes, and this particular macho viewer punched the air at the end in appreciation for a fitting finale, good work all round here, 8/10."
