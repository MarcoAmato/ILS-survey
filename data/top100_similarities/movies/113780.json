It became one of my favorite movie & below are reasons why: First, it's original, different from other horror movies, which brings interesting story, where crowd of few people seek historic relic & treasure. Movie was very eerie & creepy, especially when they go deeper & deeper close to hell. Some very strong & intense moments. Atmosphere was also eerie cause whole movie happens in damn catacombs. If you have Claustrophobia I don't recommend to watch it. If you're fan of movies like The Tunnel(2011) or The Devil's pass, you gonna like it.",

      "synopsis": "In the opening scene, there is a bus just crossing over the Iranian border. A woman, Scarlet Marlowe (Perdita Weeks) is speaking into her camera, saying she has come to Iran to search for a piece of history about to be lost in a hidden catacomb that is about to be demolished by the government. She tells the camera that she understands that she is putting herself in great danger and potential execution by the Iranian authorities by trespassing where she doesn't belong but slyly notes \"They'll have to catch me first.\" Scarlet goes to the home of Reza (Hamid Djavadan) a man who is willing to help her. His home actually has access to the catacomb Scarlet wants to enter. Reza tells her they have to be quick as the government cannot see them and the demolition is going to happen very soon. Scarlet and Reza go down but notice soldiers are down there as well. They hide and wait until they pass by. Reza wants to leave in fear of his family but Scarlet begs for a few minutes. Leaving their hiding spot, they find the inscription Scarlet was looking forward. She begins to read it, amazed by what she finds. She then takes a chisel to it to Rezas surprise. Scarlet counters they are going to blow it up away. She knocks it away to find a bull statue, The Rose Key. It is covered in markings. Scarlet begins to read them as sirens wail. The blast is imminent. Reza tells her they need to leave NOW but Scarlet refuses saying this was what her father spent his entire life searching for. Reza runs and Scarlet says she will be right behind him. She quickly captures the rest of the statue on film and runs, as the blasting commences. She dodges debris all around her and nearly gets lost. Thankfully, she sees the entrance where she first went in and Reza drags her out. Scarlet tells him she got the markings on film and now has the next step to finish her fathers work. Reza cautions her against looking for the Philosopher Stone. Her father looked for it, and His quest was a path to madness. Cue Title Sequence. Later, Scarlet is being interviewed by her cameraman Benjy (Edwin Hodge). She explains her mission to locate the Philosopher Stone, a famed item of supposed myth that could turn base metals into gold and grant who possessed it eternal life. Benjy asks about her father, and how his work possibly lead to his suicide. Scarlet is reluctant to talk about him and deflects from giving deep answers. Scarlet and Benjy are in Paris, France. They go to the home of Nicolas Flamel, a famed alchemist who was purported to have the stone and used for immortality. They got to his crypt, and Scarlet explains that grave robbers open the caskets of Flamel and his wife hoping to find the stone, but both were empty of everything, including bodies, just adding to their myth. Scarlet says that the location of the stone was said to be hidden in code on the grave stone of Flamel but she is unable to translate the language but she knows someone who can. Scarlet breaks into a church to Benjy's shock. Scarlet says she is looking for someone she knows, someone who breaks into places and fixes things. At the top of the church clock tower, they find George (Ben Feldman). George is less than happy to see her, telling Benjy the last time that he and Scarlet were together he got locked up in a prison in Turkey. Scarlet tells him she found The Rose Key, and needs him to translate for her. George realizes she went to Iran, alone, and is incredulous she put herself in that much danger. George finishes fixing the clock and they go outside to hear them ring for the first time in 284 years. George looks at Scarlet. \"I'll help you translate but that's it\", he says. When night falls, they go back to Flamel's tomb and look at the grave marker. They try to translate several markings but get nowhere. Scarlet deduces they have to look at the back of the stone. They turn it over and find nothing. However, she thinks it is hidden via chemical reactions, so she mixes up some and lights it, revealing a message on it. They now have their next clue. Benjy, Scarlet, and George look at a map trying to find a place to access where they need to go. They figure out that in the old days, people believe that hell was 741 feet down from Earth so they need to be halfway between Earth and Hell, underneath Flamel's tomb to find the stone. Scarlet realizes the catacombs are the only place low enough but Benjy notes that it is not far enough down. However, George remembers that in three spots around Paris, land cave-ins caused 100 feet of ground to collapse inward. One of those points is near Flamel's tomb. Scarlet realizes there must be a hidden catacomb in there. Benjy and Scarlet go on a sanctioned catacomb tour. Scarlet points out to Benjy exactly where they would have to enter but it is too closed off for access normally. A teenage boy nearby tells her to find Papillion (François Civil) to be their guide. The Tour guide sees Benjy and Scarlet are trailing behind and urges them back to the group. When Scarlet looks back, the boy is gone. Benjy, George and Scarlet go to a nightclub where Papillion is at. Benjy notices a strange girl that locks eyes with him intently. Scarlet tells Papillion about the hidden catacomb and though is unconvinced initially, is finally swayed when promised half of the treasure in the hidden catacomb. He tells them he will lead them. The next day, the group gets ready their gear. Among the group is Papillion's friend Souxie (Marion Lambert) and Zed (Ali Marhyar). Benjy asks about Papillion's scars on his hand. Zed says they don't talk about that. As they prepare, George reminds Scarlet that he is not going with them. Still, Scarlet convinces him to at least follow them to the entrance. When they get there, Benjy turns on cameras on each of their lights, so they can record everything that happens. George sees the small hole they are going through and balks at what they are doing. As they enter one by one, George is still vehemently against going. Suddenly, a police officer who had been following the group tackles Papillion and a scuffle begins. The group along with George flees into the tunnel in a panic. Papillion soon follows, and pops a smoke grenade so the cop will not follow them. Now free, they begin to go to work. Scarlet apologizes to George for him being there, but George doesn't want to hear it. He told her many times he didn't want to be here and yet he is. The group begins to go down the catacombs. They stop at a split path. Papillion notices that the left path which they would have to swim to is a cool room but not the way they are going to. They take the right path and continue on. As they walk, they hear some kind of disturbing chanting. Looking through some openings in nearby rocks they see a group of women in some sort of ritual. Papillion notes they are plenty of crazy people that come down here. Benjy looks in and a woman gazes at him intently. He recognizes her from the club and is freaked out. As they come to another crossroads, Papillion tells they have to take a path where they will have to crawl over a path of bones. Benjy says he will not do it, freaked out. Scarlet points out another path and says it will save the group hours. Papillion says absolutely not, as that is the bad path. Scarlett continues to argue but Papillion tells her he knows the catacombs better than she ever will. Furthermore, he, Zed, and Souxie had a friend named Mole who took that path out of eventual curiosity and they never saw him again. George talks to Scarlet and tells her that Papillion knows what he is doing and she can be a little more patient if it means keeping everyone safe. The group moves through the path. However, Benjy gets stuck and begins to suffer claustrophobia. Scarlet works several minutes to calm him down, and he finally crawls through. However, his actions help cause a tunnel collapse and he barely makes it through alive. When the six of them look around, it appears they are in the same place they just came from but there is no other way to keep going but the \"bad\" path Papillion refused to go through. The rest of the group overrules him, noting they have no other choice. As they walk through, they see a graffiti symbol much like one Papillion tagged earlier. Scarlet confronts him over this, but he denies ever being in this part of the catacombs. Suddenly, they hear a ringing phone. George notes that they used to be some phone cables down in the catacombs but they were all taken out. As they continue to hear it, George sees a sign that confirms they are in the area where the ground collapse and a 100 people dropped to their deaths. Papillion confirms this and that when they went in to fix the problem, 50 more people disappeared. As they continue to walk, they find an old piano, randomly sitting in a corner. Everyone thinks it is trippy. George says he used to have one that he and his brother Danny would play but the A4 key was broken. He begins to play a song but hits the A4 key to find it broken. George freaks out, asking Scarlet what is happening. Scarlet continues to hear the phone ring and goes searching for it. She finds a rotary phone sitting on a table. She answers it and hears a disembodied voice on the other end. She asks who is there but gets no response. She slams the phone down in fright. The group then looks further down the path only to be confronted with Mole, Papillion's long thought dead friend. Mole asks if they are looking for a way out, and the group says yes. Mole tells them the only way out is down. He directs them to a well and they begin to set up to rappel down. As George is going down, Benjy preps to go down next. However, his rope breaks and he falls until he smashes into George. In the process, he hurts his hands badly, so Scarlett bandages them up. When all six are down, they walk down a narrow corridor with an opening in the middle where water flows. Suddenly, the noise around them distorts, making it hard for them to hear, only to be replaced with loud, banging noises right after. In the confusion, one of their cameras catches the image of small child. At the end of the path, there appears to be another dead end. However, George and Scarlet find some carvings in the stone and realize it is like an Egyptian tomb and they have press the right stone to get entrance. Using the inscriptions they have, they correctly guess the right stone and door opens. The group enters and finds a well preserved corpse in Templar armor. Scarlet sees inscriptions on the wall that prove that her search is not a wild goose chase; the stone is real. On a hunch, she makes the group turns off their lights. Seeing a light coming from the floor, she discovers and underwater chasm that she crosses over. In it, she finds a treasure room and a wall with markings. The rest of the group come over and of course overjoyed despite the hardships that they are now rich. Scarlet looks at the wall and relates a myth about the birth of the sun and his envy of his parents love. She finds the Philosopher stone and chips it out of the wall. She finds it funny that priceless artifact is right next to such to find treasure. Her face goes white. Its a trap! she screams too late. Papillion has just broken off the door of the treasure room, which causes a cave in to occur. The group is all shook up but alive. They have to drag out Souxie from the rubble, and she got a messed up arm in the process. Scarlet uses shavings from the Philosopher Stone and heals her to the shock of the group. Realizing that Mole had apparently been killed in the cave in, they move on, trying to find a new way out. Scarlet and George find a new opening and begin to crawl through. George finds an inscription and Scarlet translates it as Abandon all hope, ye who enter here which is supposedly what is inscribed at the gates of hell. Papillion is really freaked out by this point but once again, they have no choice but go through the path they have. When they come out on the other side, they realize it looks like the room they just exited but everything is upside down and/or opposite. Papillion then sees the way they came in has disappeared completely. He asks Scarlet if they are dead in Hell. Scarlett says no. Souxie sees Mole and is startled by him. She tries to go up to him to see if he is okay but he flips out, grabs her by the throat, and bashes her skull in on the ground to the horror of the group. As they go to help Souxie, Mole disappears. Papillion begs Scarlet to use the stone to heal Souxie but it doesn't work because she is already dead. Papillion is heartbroken and the group has to keep going. As they begin to walk, Scarlet sees a noose hanging only to look again and see that it is gone. The group realizes that everything they are experiencing now is a mirror image of what they have already done, and all they are doing is just going deeper down into the earth. The group finds another well and rappel down. As Benjy gets ready to go down, he hears a baby cry. He turns around and yells if anyone is there. Looking again, the same woman that he had been seeing over and over screams and charges him. Startled, he falls down the hole without his harness and hits the ground, dead. Scarlet is absolutely horrified now that her expedition has now caused two deaths. George pulls her along, saying they need to keep moving. They have crossed another path of bones. As George is going, he sees a reflection of Danny, his brother drowning. He screams, and tries to get to his brother through the bones. Scarlet has to calm him down, reminding him it isn't real, and why would Danny be here in the catacombs now. Crossing over the path, they see a light in the distance. Getting closer, they realize it is a fire. Turning the corner they see it is a car on fire, with a young man inside who turns and looks at him. Papillion looks at the car in shock and screams: \"NO! IT WASN'T MY FAULT!\" (the boy is implied to be his brother or a close friend). Suddenly, an invisible force pulls Papillion towards the car. Scarlet and George try to hold him back but it is no use. Papillion is pulled into the flaming wreck, only for the flaming car to crumple up into a ball and disappear, leaving Papillion buried alive with his legs sticking out of the ground. Scarlet and George try to get him out only to realize it is too late for him. He's already dead. Now the group only has Scarlet, George, and Zed. As they continue down the catacombs, they see a robed figure. Knowing it is nothing good, they hide behind a corner. Knowing they might be dead soon, George talks briefly to Scarlet. Whatever happens, the week in Turkey was the best week of my life, he tells her. Mine too, she replies. The three of them look at the robed figure as he sits in a chair. He gets up after a minute and looks at them. The three run. They take a breather on a wall that has stone figures built into the walls. The stone figures come to life and attack them, one biting George in the neck. Scarlet and Zed drag him away, destroying some of the stone figures in the process. Scarlet tries to use the stone to heal George but it is not working. She realizes that now that reality is opposite, she never had the real stone. She has to go back to the wall where she found it, put it back and get the real stone. She tells Zed to watch George while she backtracks to the wall. Zed is afraid but Scarlet tells him if she doesn't go, George will die. Scarlet backtracks through the catacombs. At the spot where water flowed through the floor, it has been replaced with blood and hands reach out, trying to grab her. Scarlet escapes their grasp. She comes across a hooded figure hanging from a rope. She believes it is a hallucination of her father, but when she takes the hood off, she finds herself, who screams at her. She runs off and finds the wall where she found the stone. She puts it back in place but isn't sure where the real stone is. Looking at the wall she finds a large, gold orb at the center. She wipes some dust off it and looks at her reflection. On her way back to George, she sees a hallucination of her dead father, hanging from a noose. She gets up close and tells her father she's sorry she didn't take his call the night he killed himself. She didn't know he was that sick. His image disappears and she runs back to where George and Zed are, killing a few stone figures along the way. Zed asks if she got the stone and Scarlet says yes. She then puts her hands on Georges neck and kisses him. When she pulls her hands away, his wounds are healed and he comes back to life (the explanation behind what exactly she got from the wall isn't really explained). Seeing the stone figures chasing them, they continue deeper into the catacombs. Scarlet finds yet another well down, but they know they will not have time to get down in a safe manner before the creatures get them. Scarlet says they will have to jump. Zed and George balk at doing that, noting they could die from a fall like that. However, Scarlet points out everything they have experienced and deduce if that they are actually in a circle of hell, they are being tormented for their guilt about past incidents. Scarlet is feeling guilty about her father's suicide, Zed had a child that he refused to acknowledge, and George's brother Danny drowned when he couldn't get back in time to save him. Scarlet says if they take a leap of faith and rectify their guilt, they have a chance. If they don't, they're dead anyway. George doesn't want to but Scarlet says she won't leave without him. The three hold hands and jump down the hole. They land, bruised but alive. Looking around, Zed doesn't see any exits and freaks out that everything was for nothing. However, Scarlet thinks about the phrase that has defined much of their journey; \"As Above, So Below\" and figures out there is an exit on the floor. Scarlet and George discover a manhole and after figuring out how to get it open, climb through and the three finds themselves back on the streets of Paris. They quickly cover the manhole back up, sealing the entrance. Zed exhales in relief and shock while Scarlet and George silently embrace, all three traumatized by the ordeal. The final scene is Scarlet's earlier interview with Benjy. She says some people think she is going after the Philosopher Stone for fame and fortune but it could not be further from the truth. Benjy asks if that is what she is really after, the truth. Scarlet confirms that is what she is truly after. \"I want the truth\", she says. The End.",

         "\"As Above, So Below\" I pondered this film for some time now. I've been trying to understand why it's done so poorly for the critics (not that that affects my opinion about a film). But I just didn't understand how we could have such stark differences in opinions about this film. I've heard it called, chiched, forced, just like all the other found footage films in this \"saturated genre\". And I thought none of those were true about this film. Save maybe \"forced\" in some moments. Where to begin with this convoluted breakdown. The film clearly had some absurd qualities. First and foremost is the painfully contrived female protagonist. A mid-twenties girl who is fluent in 4 languages and 2 dead languages and 2 PhD's. Oh and a black belt in Krav Maga. She was beautiful, adventurous, intelligent, brave. Really? Too much. Waaay too much. HOWEVER. I know why they did it. For the sake of the story they needed a character who could do all of those things. The solution to this would've been simply to cast an older person. But that wouldn't cater to the targeted audience. They needed a full cast of young 20 somethings. There were other small things that were a little far fetched. Like \"oh they conveniently had enough cameras for everyone and they never broke or got water damage.\" Of course. For the sake of a film in this type of genre to continue that had to be the case. First I would like to debunk the myth that the \"found footage\" genre is saturated and overdone. Let me think of a couple memorable found footage films: \"The Blair Witch Project\".... \"Paranormal Activities\".... ummmm..... \"Cloverfield\"? I mean that's really all that stands out to me, but I'm not an avid horror fan. Maybe \"Quarantine\". The point is if you wanna complain about over done genres maybe you should look more in the direction of \"If I stay\", or \"The Maze Runner\" and movies alike. Or Exorcism movies. Oh. My. Gosh. Talk about overdone. No other movie has beautifully meshed these two genres together. Historical-Mystery- Adventure and Horror. Maybe \"The Mummy\" but even that wasn't really going for HORROR. And maybe that's why I particularly enjoyed this film so much. I love the Historical adventures such as \"Indiana Jones\", \"Laura Croft\", \"National Treasure\". And they painted an idea that I don't think has been done a lot or very well. I've never seen a film that has painted Hell like they did. And I'm gonna be real, I was very creeped/stressed/scared. I think it's strongest point was it's middle act. It's build up to the finale was very well done. I continually had a sharp pain in my chest until the end. Also \"George\" was a pretty good actor. And the french people. Change the main girl and you've got a great movie. In the end my reasons for why I liked it so much was that it was a fresh horror, unlike.. oh... I dunno... the thousands of possession and exorcism movies that come out every freaking year. And the concept was really intriguing. As far as horror movies go? 9/10",
         "\"As Above, So Below\" centers on two archaeologists and a group of urban spelunkers who break into the catacombs below Paris. However, unlike most naive tourists, they have quite the reason: they are in search of an arcane philosopher's stone that purportedly holds the powers of eternal life. Unfortunately, the group becomes trapped in a labyrinth of caves that lead them deeper and deeper into the earth... and closer and closer toward the gates of hell. Directed and co-written by John Erick Dowdle, who was behind \"Devil\" and the apocryphally unreleased \"Poughkeepsie Tapes\", \"As Above, So Below\" is, at its roots, an action-packed adventure flick melded with the makings of found-footage horror, and, although at times ridiculous, I'd be lying if I said it wasn't wildly entertaining. The central crux of the plot hinges on a mystical stone whose existence has been buried (literally and metaphorically) by history, and the protagonist, Scarlett (Perdita Weeks), the daughter of an archaeologist and alchemy student, makes it her life goal to finish her deceased father's work and find it. While this is admittedly fantastical and no doubt requires a slight stretching of the imagination, the historical and mythological aspects of the film still manage to be compelling none the less. That said, the real hook of the film lies in its setting: les Catacombes de Paris. To date, I only know of one other film that takes place in the ghoulish setting� the slightly underwhelming \"Catacombs\" (2007). While both films are very different in plot, they both share the same pull due to their unusually extraordinary setting. \"As Above, So Below\" also admittedly borrows elements from Neil Marshall's \"The Descent\", but those who call this film a \"found footage rip-off\" are way off base. Both films take place underground, yes, and \"As Above, So Below\" does appear to borrow a couple of sequential elements from Marshall's film, but they are complete tonal opposites. There are plenty of wild and fun elements in this film, including secret passageways, trapdoors, circular passageways, and ringing telephones 500 feet under the earth, but all of it is done in good taste and manages to evoke some solid scares. The hand-held camera-work accentuates the explorers' sense of disorientation, and one gets the increasing sense of desperation as they venture deeper and deeper into the belly of the beast. That said, the most obvious issue with the film is that it suffers from a half-baked plot design surrounding the individuals' reliving/re-facing demons of their past, which appears to have been an overarching, perhaps even singular theme, but it fails to really take hold of the film, crumbling under the film's dynamic subterranean locale; quite literally under the weight of the earth. I felt like this entire subplot(?) could have been completely stripped from the script, and we still would have had a solid film here. I don't want to say that it juggles too many themes as a result, because it really doesn't, but the incorporation of this with the mythology of the film comes off as a little bit harebrained. There is already enough Indiana Jones whimsy to be had here as it is, so these sequences of characters facing past demons are ultimately ineffective among the rest of the film's funhouse attractions. Even still, I found this to be a wildly entertaining thriller and a good, claustrophobic two hours at the cinema. It is not a great film, but it is a well made film, and is especially a delight for anyone who is as fascinated by the Paris catacombs as I am, or just subterranean depths in general. It's claustrophobic, fast-paced, and at times genuinely spooky; at other times, it's absolutely silly and edges into Indiana Jones territory, but at the end of the day, I thought this was a solid concoction of fantasy, adventure-thriller, and supernatural horror elements. Take it for what it is, and it's rightfully enjoyable. 6/10.",
         "First of all, there aren't a ton of good Horrors out there that are truly original. I'm not saying this movie is one of them, but that lack of originality shouldn't be the reason to give any movie a lower score. Bringing fresh ideas to the Horror genre is difficult, mostly because it's difficult to find new ways to scare people. There aren't a ton of moments that make you jump, but I think the genre isn't really about making people jump anymore. Audiences have gotten good at predicting when these moments happen. Where this movie does well, along with the rest of my favorite horror movies, is atmosphere. For me, having a dark, creepy atmosphere is far more important to success in this genre than getting people to leap out of their seats. The shaky-cam, found-footage style isn't that much of an issue for me either. Actually, I think still does a good job portraying realism, despite being a bit disorienting and annoying. Story-wise, I'd say it's pretty unique. How many other horrors involving descent into the earth to find historical relics can you think of off the top of your head? One, two maybe... How many horrors can you think of off the top of your head involving a haunted house, a possessed child or doll, exorcism, a guy with a mask, or a cabin in the woods? 100? Not to say this is bad, but I'll gladly welcome anything outside traditional horror settings and scenarios. It does dip into the realm of ridiculousness as some points, but nothing too over-the-top and far-fetched for the situation. The acting is good and the characters are believable for the most part. I would have cleaned up the final act a little bit more, but it was good enough to keep me satisfied. Not sure what the critics are bashing it for. If there is anything to really complain about it's not this movie, but the genre itself. That being said, lower your expectations and you might like it. I'd give it a solid 7 out of 10.",
         "Horror movies are rarely called 'great.' When was the last critically acclaimed horror movie released? You'd be hard-pressed to find anything since The Ring in 2002. I haven't seen The Conjuring, Mama or Oculus but people say they've got potential. I thought Drag Me to Hell was pretty good from 2009. But the last great one I caught in theaters was Devil from 2010. Which is also directed by John Dowdle. He wrote Quarantine (2008), as well � another solid semi- recent horror. As Above/So Below is the best horror movie I've seen in a long time. First of all, it's shot on-location in Paris, which is a delight for any fan of that city. Favorite sights like Notre Dame and Sacre-Coeur are featured throughout. The filmmakers use almost every shooting style. AA/SB is a mockumentary about Scarlett (played by Perdita Weeks) a young archaeologist searching for the philosopher's stone. Therefore much of the footage is shot in first-person via headlamp GoPro cams. Although I'm sick of 'found footage' it works better here. For obvious reasons, the budget can't be massive, so this filmmaking style is particularly suited to horror. The story is also good, co-written by the director and his brother, Drew. There's more nuance than usual. The main characters use deductive reasoning and historical analysis in order to solve riddles and navigate the labyrinthine catacombs. There's a lot of rebirth imagery, but I wonder just how far the metaphor goes. Are the ribbed tunnels supposed to be reminiscent of a vaginal lining? Dichotomies drawn between light and dark, and up and down, are intriguing and thought provoking. The cast of unknowns delivers strong performances. It's tough to get through a whole scary movie without poor acting or cheesy moments. Apparently I'm in the minority because AA/SB is getting 13% amongst top critics and 57% amongst the users on Rotten Tomatoes. But I would encourage an open mind, because it's a cut above the rest. If you're looking for a decent flick this weekend, especially if you dig horror, you can do a lot worse than As Above/So Below.",
         "This is one I was excited for. The found-footage genre has been on life support for a while now but this one had a cool premise in a great setting - the catacombs. Seriously, that alone makes the movie worth a watch if you're a horror fan. The unsettling atmosphere, the claustrophobia, the creepy imagery, all while delving deeper and deeper into the Earth. I feel like this is a no brainer but if you're not a found-footage horror fan then you won't like this one. You've seen it all before and this is no different. All the usual plot devices and tropes that come along with the genre are here - it's just executed with finesse. The setting has a lot to do with it: It sets up the tone of the movie and keeps that ominous vibe present throughout. There aren't many surprises to be found here. It's a found-footage movie so it takes a little while to get going, but once it hits its stride it becomes a truly exciting adventure to be on. You really get the first person feel in this movie. They don't need excuses to be documenting this - they're explorers. We're just watching what they saw. That little sense of believability goes a long way in helping the movie's credibility and effectiveness. There are few actual scares in As Above So Below. It has an atmosphere similar to The Descent and keeps the slow eerie pace throughout the first two acts of the film. That in my opinion is the greatest strength of this film, and any others of its ilk - the focus on atmosphere rather than shock horror or jump scares. In the third act, sh*t starts to go down, and it goes down big time. It's not anything spectacular, none of the film is honestly, but I was satisfied at the end of this movie and that's more than I can say about a lot of the found-footage movies I've seen recently. A pleasant surprise in horror is good acting, and this movie thrives on it. Even though it takes a while for the movie to kick off, it's fun being introduced to these characters and starting this adventure with them because they are convincing in their roles and they actually have personality. You can identify with the two leads - one is the ambitious adventurer, the other is the neurotic realist. Then there's the eccentric and unreliable \"tour guide\" that introduces them on this hellish quest. It's just a lot of fun to be a part of this journey because none of us know what will be waiting for us on the other side. Overall this is just a well made found-footage movie. It has the chills, it has the thrills, and the added bonuses of good acting and an excellent premise. Horror fans will certainly get a kick out of it, and even if you're just looking for a midnight creep movie then As Above, So Below will not disappoint.",
         "I think people are hating on this movie way more than they should. Yes it is a horror film and no i was not terrified crying in the corner of the theater, but to say this movie didn't scare you it just seems like you think you're this super macho man who isn't scared of anything because you beat slender-man at 2 am in your parents basement. The hand-held camera work is still a very cool concept in my opinion and the filmmakers did an amazing job with this, primarily because they're actually in the catacombs of Paris! Let alone i thought the actors did a great job, and it was very believable and it the hand-held camera work made you feel like one of the characters experiencing the whole thing. No it was not the scariest movie of all time, no it doesn't have some deep meaning, but for the 9$ i spent to go see it, i absolutely loved it. Very cool movie in concept and it was done very well. People who hate on this movie really just don't appreciate it",
         "As I'm currently living in Paris and actually visited the Catacombes a few days earlier, I had high hopes for this film. The setup of the movie is promising as well, because the Catacombes can be quite scary. Therefore, a lot of ingredients for a good scary movie. Alas, it turned out to be nothing of the sort. A very far-fetched plot, predictable scares, and the overly shaky hand-cam which is past its prime were the culprits of my disappointment. Add to that some flimsy romantic love story, and you got a mediocre film at best. However, I do not want to give the impression that this movie was all bad. There were some pretty decent scares despite their lack of originality. I'm sure that if this movie would have come out ten years ago, it could have been a major hit. But after Blair Witch Project, Rec, and Paranormal Activity, it is difficult to insert a new angle into the whole hand-cam-genre. So if you just want a decent scary movie for 90 minutes while keeping your expectations limited, Catacombes would be a decent choice.",
         "This movie is definitely not for movie goers who dislike \"Found Footage\" Or \"First Person Camera\" movies. Additionally it is not for movie goers who get easily sick or nauseous due to constant jerky moving camera shots... Well that said, I LOVED IT! I saw a short trailer for it online and didn't really understand too much about it except that it had to do with Paris's catacombs. I knew the movie was supposed to be scary and therefore i was expecting some sort of ghost or demon angle to it, but to my surprise the plot had MUCH more depth to it and was very intriguing. I found myself researching more about the theme, plot and background when i got home. Now i know some people have trashed this move just because Harry Potter did its own take on the philosophers stone first, therefore (IMO) tainting their ability to distance themselves from this movies original fresh take on it.... This is INCREDIBLY unfortunate, as this movie really takes a original take/stance and expands on it very well. It also incorporates numerous other cultures mythology throughout this process. For those who don't know, the \"Philosophers' Stone\" or otherwise know as the stone of the philosophers is a legendary alchemical substance said to be capable of turning base metals such as lead into gold or silver. It was also sometimes believed to be an elixir of life, useful for rejuvenation and possibly for achieving immortality. For many centuries, it was the most sought- after goal in alchemy. This movie contains BOTH the gold angles as well as the elixir of life (And its healing abilities). I LOVED how it incorporated this with other different mythologies to really give the audience a its own original take on Hates (Otherwise Known as HELL) and the paranormal and then mixing it with a wild treasure hunt adventure. If you can get past the jerky camera movements, You will find yourself getting literally GLUED to the screen as it takes you a wild roller-cost ride throughout Paris's underground catacombs. These catacombs hold nearly SIX MILLION peoples remains!! This definitely gives the movie that extra edge because of the dark backdrop of skeletons and death at every turn of endless tunnels, The group often finds themselves having to climb through small openings literally littered from on top to bottom with piles of bones. The main characters are archaeologists, who also happen to be experienced treasure hunters.The quest like i mentioned above is for the Philosophers stone, this is what the Scarlett (Perdita Weeks) father had been searching for his ENTIRE life. **SPOILER** Her father is who you see in the beginning, (They both are in country in the middle east (Syria? or Saudi Arabia? Not remember..) But they are searching for a hidden wall that contains clues to where the stone is hidden. There is where he meets his death (Hung with a noose)... She then is determined to complete his life long quest. The movie is something of Indiana Jones mixed with National Treasure, It has hidden clues and messages that must be deciphered in order to advance to get to the next clue/phase/part. In the end, it takes them into the catacombs where an group of french friends leads them to the spot they believe the stone is hidden. This group of friends refer to themselves as the most experienced catacomb explorers and are essentially their \"tour guides\" . You (As the Audience) will experience paranormal activity, Hates (Hell), immortality, and a deathly adventure that claims the lives of many.... IF not ALL ;P... Well, i won't spoil that part! You will just have to go and find out!!! I would best relate this movie as a mix of GRAVE ENCOUNTERS and NATIONAL TREASURE. A unique mix of National Treasure type treasure hunt, BUT with a huge catch. This is where the The Grave Encounters paranormal vortex applies! Once the group enters the final phase by entering into the catacombs... there's no turning back home. The group discovers that the entrance of the tunnels of which they have entered, does not exist. They quickly learn that the only hope of survival is to push forward deeper into catacombs,,,, furthermore they eventually discover that completing the quest of finding the philosophers stone is there only means to not only survival... but their only means to escape the dimensional vortex. 8.5 out of 10! Best scary movie I've seen in awhile!!",
         "I was almost put off watching this film due to some of the bad reviews I'd read elsewhere, so I went with an open mind but didn't regret it. Not since Blair Witch have I been more engrossed in a film which, in parts, was genuinely scary and claustrophobic...it really sucks you in to the point you feel that you are down there with them... Once the initial \"introduction to the characters\" bit was over and they entered the first part of the catacomb, the film properly began...from the minute they passed a group of strange naked women carrying out what I assume what satanic chants deep below the ground, I was hooked...and the phone ringing really freaked me out....!! The section when they were in \"hell\" was intense with noises that you would indeed associate with such a place, if it were to exist..deep screams and cries, absolutely terrifying...the hooded demons were the stuff of real nightmares and you just wondered what the hell (pardon the pun) was going on down there as without the groups head torches they would be down there in the pitch black...doing what I wondered..? Very eerie to say the least...it was definitely a good interpretation of hell... This film is not for the purists amongst us, and there is indeed room for criticism...the shaky camera is not everyone's cup of tea and at times, you are relieved when they are static for a brief moment and the motion stops, however this did not distract me from what was a thoroughly enjoyable film...there is also an element of scooby do about the whole thing as the group keep repeating \"we must carry on\" every time something bad happened and the constant running away from bad things... As for the ending...I didn't get it as such, but i liked it....it does make you think...you leave the cinema pondering on what just happened and HOW it could happen...it maybe wasn't the crap ending that some reviewers have stated...I liked it... Quite simply, If you liked Blair Witch, you will like this...if you're looking for high budget, great acting and CGI, you won't... I'd give it 8/10 purely because the shaky camera was at times too much and you just wanted a bit of camera stabilisation..!! I'd recommend this film, definitely..",
         "I'm afraid I didn't enjoy this movie. I thought it started well enough (with some reservations), but it became disjointed and confusing in the second half. The Scarlett character was interesting (a teenage frenetic Indiana Jones on speed), but by the second half it was annoying me that she was solving these complex puzzles under intense pressure in just seconds. The George character: someone in his 20s who is an Aramaic expert and can fix medieval church clocks? GMAFB. What really annoyed me was when -- on the spot and under great pressure -- he translated a difficult to read text from Aramaic (?) into English, and it came out like a 19th century poem, rhyming and with words like \"twixt\". WTF? I thought I was following it all well enough but then the \"worst fear materialised\" theme arose. Yikes. That came out of nowhere. Even when the movie is over, it's not clear why that was added to the film. That idea has been around an awfully long time. The various alchemical, mythological and religious references were all a jumbled mess. The sunken cavern, the mass deaths, the gate to hell, the sound distortion, the treasure room, the philosopher's stone, the strange chanting women, the monk-like creatures, La Taupe, and so on. There were quite a few other unanswered points. They were introducing frightening elements for no reason other than to be frightening. I didn't find it that frightening. I looked at my watch several times during the movie. I groaned audibly a few times. I didn't really like the shaky cam and the found-footage concept. It's difficult to maintain that for very long. For those who died far underground, how did their footage survive? Who was filming them at the very end? It annoyed me that the characters were vocalizing so much. Yes, I know we needed that for dramatic reasons. I hated it. People don't do that in real life. I'd give this movie about a 5 or a 5.5. I've toured the Paris Catacombs, so I really wanted to like this movie. Sorry."
