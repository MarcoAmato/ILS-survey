            "content": "So where were you when the Science Fiction cinema sensation \u2018Star Wars\u2019 took shape and captured the imagination of the massive global moviegoers\u2019 escapist expectations back in 1977? Regardless of whether you existed thirty-eight years ago or not, the legend of George Lucas\u2019 highly-heralded SF blockbuster that shattered box office records worldwide was automatically engrained in your cinematic psyche. Now nearly four decades later, the motion picture phenomenon that took place in \u2018a galaxy a long time ago\u2026far, far away\u2019 has come to expand its entertaining promise and prominence even after numerous servings of movie sequels, television specials and other fanfare attributes that promoted the \u2018Star Wars\u2019 agenda throughout the countless years.\r\n\r\nThe modern-day arrival of yet another \u2018Star Wars\u2019 edition in the millennium movie-making age of technical and tactical brilliance is quite fitting and filmmaker J.J. Abrams is the right choice to helm this sacred film franchise and present a whole new litany of continuing adventurous narratives for a new generation of \u2018Star Wars\u2019 personalities dipping their tenacious toes into \u2018the force of goodness\u2019 battling \u2018the dark side\u2019 of authoritative evil.\r\n\r\nIn Abrams\u2019s reboot \u2018Star Wars: The Force Awakens\u2019, the anticipation of enhancing and enlightening the reputation and respect of the Lucas landscape of stormtroopers, light sabres and of course the iconic \u2018Star Wars\u2019 returnees from the treasured trio of Harrison Ford (Han Solo)/Carrie Fisher (Leia) and Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker) registers with a nostalgic blast of appreciation and exhilaration. \u2018The Force Awakens\u2019 is a sheer big screen celebration of majestic impishness and intrigue that will fortify the hunger of both casual and rabid \u2018Star Wars\u2019 fanatics. Indeed, the hype is warranted and Abrams, the mastermind of the big-budget movie sequelitis, is in top form as he triumphantly presents \u2018The Force Awakens\u2019 on a prized silver platter designed for its surging golden moments of charged ebullience.\r\n\r\nIn looking at the numbers game that is connected to the overall \u2018Star Wars\u2019 universe, it is hard to believe that the last prequel was released just a decade ago. Furthermore, it is mind-boggling that the aforementioned \u2018Star Wars\u2019 \u2018royalty\u2019 in Ford, Fisher and Hamill have shared the same space on film for the first time in over three decades since they last were featured in a \u2018Star Wars\u2019 movie together. Nevertheless, no one can deny that \u2018The Force Awakens\u2019 does not take the challenge in combining the remembrance of the \u2018Star Wars\u2019 installments of yesteryear with the fresh brand of current upstarts willing to engage in another boisterous saga that begins a whole chapter of compelling wonderment. The mix of veterans and novices in \u2018The Force Awakens\u2019 is quite interesting but the familiarity of the storytelling heft of good vs. evil is always a solid sell in the realm of the \u2018Star Wars\u2019 utopia.\r\n\r\nThe good news is that \u2018The Force Awakens\u2019 not only serves as a bridge that crosses both boundaries past and present in \u2018Star Wars\u2019 folklore but it taps into the masterful mystique that Lucas and company worked so diligently to showcase so historically some thirty-eight years ago. Still, some may have lobbied for a stronger storyline in \u2018The Force Awakens\u2019 as they may gently dismiss it as being merely thin in its premise while viewing it primarily as a launching pad to develop yet another series of movies to create the \u2018Star Wars\u2019 juggernaut for this current-day climax of warped speed wizardry. For those that want a basic outline of \u2018The Force Awakens\u2019 pulse it is as such where the beloved yet aging tandem of standouts Han Solo and Chewbacca (yes, good old hulking and walking hairball Chewie is back) is helping out heroic new bloods\u2019 Rey and Finn (played by Daisy Ridley and John Boyega)\u2019 in an effort to groom them for combating the emergence of Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), a villainous representative from the Dark Side of the Force.  \r\n\r\nBasically, \u2018The Force Awakens\u2019 is a grand and stirring homage to the prolific Science Fiction/space fantasy that dared to soar its ambitious wings while taking the old-fashioned concept of the good guys sparring with the bad guys and spinning a whimsical web of dark imperialism while searching for the intrinsic value of brotherhood. One cannot imagine the vitality of \u2018Star Wars\u2019 without the inclusion of notable and favorite characterizations that were instrumental in inviting a ravenous response to this filming phenom that has existed in your pop cultural lives for too many years to recount. In addition to joining top dogs in Ford\u2019s Han Solo, Hamill\u2019s Luke Skywalker, Fisher\u2019s General Leia Organa (the former Princess Leia to all you old school \u2018Star Wars\u2019 enthusiasts out there) and Peter Mayhew\u2019s Chewbacca, there is the welcomed presence of C3-PO (Anthony Daniels) as well. As for C3-PO\u2019s newest sidekick BB-8, a mechanical rolling ball robot, he is the R2-D2 replacement that should easily win the heart of the kiddies looking for a cute contraption of a companion to treasure on the spot. It should be pointed out that \u2018The Force Awakens\u2019 is set 30 years from the last installment and thankfully this update has not lost a magical step since that time.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, the First Order\u2019s solar system mechanism needs to be destroyed and must be eradicated by the young talents in spunky and pretty Rey (think the athletic female version of Luke Skywalker) as she teams up with former stormtrooper Finn, a warrior with an uncharacteristic compassion for not killing any designated weak soul as instructed. Naturally, this duo (while under the tutelage of the mature and ragged-looking Han Solo) has their hands full as they clash with the nefarious General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson from \u2018Brooklyn\u2019) and his Special Forces protégé Kylo Ren that strikes an immediate comparison to \u2018Star Wars\u2019 most notorious bad boy in the deliciously ruthless Darth Vader.\r\n\r\nDaisy Ridley's Rey and John Boyega's Finn are having a blast as the touted twosome out to save the day in J.J. Abram's celebrated STAR WARS reboot THE FORCE AWAKENS\r\nDaisy Ridley\u2019s Rey and John Boyega\u2019s Finn are having a blast as the touted twosome out to save the day in J.J. Abram\u2019s celebrated STAR WARS reboot THE FORCE AWAKENS\r\nThankfully, the majority of the audience may recall similar elements in \u2018The Force Awakens\u2019 that was touched upon in \u2018Star Wars\u2019 editions such as \u2018A New Hope\u2019 and \u2018Return Of The Jedi\u2019 where the same structure and theme of the plot points are somewhat revisited. As charming and stimulating as \u2018The Force Awakens\u2019 appears in its glorious presentation of being a beautifully shot and visually vibrant popcorn piece, the real find in Abrams\u2019 spectacular space-aged spectacle is Ridley\u2019s heroine Rey, whose emotional and physical commitment to this futuristic fable feels grounded in genuine suspense and praise. Ridley has legitimate game and carries this hot and heavy galactic actioner on her sturdy shoulders with the overwhelming pressure of headlining a cinema giant looking the re-enter the consciousness of rabid \u2018Star Wars\u2019 aficionados everywhere. Clearly, we are invested in Ridley\u2019s Rey whose feistiness never undercuts her feminine convictions or courageousness. She runs circles around her male co-stars in fellow \u2018Star Wars\u2019 newbies Boyega/Finn and Driver/Kylo Ren and her sense of empowerment is what drives the authentic Force behind Abrams\u2019 inherited \u2018Star Wars\u2019 workload.\r\n\r\n\u2018Star Wars: The Force Awakens\u2019 gleefully ignites the flashy flames of giddiness that we all associate with George Lucas\u2019 indomitable big screen creation. The signature flourishes from composure John Williams\u2019 commanding musical score to the stunning and innovative technical tweaking to the mixture of the old and new guard in front of the camera all make for an eventful and exciting return to the universal staging for a movie-making moment that will stand the test of time, the immense pop cultural movement at the movies known as \u2018Star Wars\u2019.\r\n\r\nStar Wars: The Force Awakens (2015)\r\n\r\nLucasfilms\r\n\r\n2 hrs. 15 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Harrison Ford, Daisy Ridley, Carrie Fisher, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, Adam Driver, Peter Mayhew, Domhnall Gleeson, Lupita Nyong\u2019o, Andy Serkis, Gwendoline Christie, Kenny Baker, Anthony Daniels  and Max von Sydow\r\n\r\nDirected and Co-Written by: J.J.

Although new characters and mysteries were introduced, the plot was too similar to the 4th film, but hey, at least they blew up the republic so no more boring bureaucracy!\r\nOne more thing that bothered me a lot is Kylo ren, not the character, the actor. I mean they couldn't pick an uglier wimp? I mean no offense Adam Driver, but bad guys need to look badass, and once you took of your helmet, you lost all hope of becoming a badass.\r\n\r\n**Summary:**\r\n\r\nDefinitely a movie worth watching despite minor setbacks.",

Someone who just loves the Star Wars universe as a spectacle prism of entertainment, and has just wanted a Star Wars film worthy of being fit to sit alongside that original trilogy?\r\n\r\nThis made me feel 11 again, took me back to a time in 1977 when I queued for three hours to see such wonders on the big screen. The Force Awakens is, in spite of the recognised flaws, a loving homage to a past love. It's sly with humour and nods to foundations, a blitzkrieg of effects and sound work (my Blu-ray viewing had my sub-woofer doing a jitterbug in the lounge), and it doesn't shy from surprise or the dangling of the carrot.\r\n\r\nThe makers have big heart and technical invention, the cast vibrant, spunky and strongly committed to the cause - the old hands a very reassuring presence - Yeah, so it's not sci-fi perfection, or any Star Wars geeks' idea of the perfect Star Wars movie (oh J.J. Abrams you devil you!), but it made this middle aged guy shed a tear of happiness. A moment to reaffirm why - as a young lad - I fell in love with film in the first place. 9/10",

            "content": "**The Force Awakens: A New Hope 2.0**\r\n\r\nThe highly-anticipated follow-up to the Original Trilogy treads through familiar waters, taking the \"safe route\" approach. Though The Force Awakens has its fair share of phenomenal moments and is definitely an improvement over the Prequel Trilogy, its reliance on using the Original Trilogy (mainly A New Hope) as a template feels nothing more than an imitation of events that occurred prior.\r\n\r\nAt the end of Return of the Jedi, the Empire suffered a great loss, with the destruction of the Second Death Star and deaths of The Emperor and Darth Vader. It was implied that Luke, the last surviving Jedi, would restart a New Jedi Order (based on Expanded Universe media, which has been declared non-canon by Disney). That is indeed what happens; however, a rogue student of Luke's slaughtered his peers, seduced by the mysterious Supreme Leader Snoke of the First Order and adopts a new identity as Kylo Ren. In summary, the Jedi Order did indeed happen (off-screen), but gets wiped out (off-screen, again), leaving Luke the last surviving Jedi and retreats into exile (off-screen... seeing a pattern?). The Empire is basically resurrected as the First Order, with the Rebel Alliance becoming the Resistance, and once again, they're tasked with destroying a gigantic ball of death. Sounds an awful lot like A New Hope, as a modern-day \"soft reboot.\" \r\n\r\nDroid carrying top-secret info? Check.\r\nVillain dressed in black with mask? Check.\r\nProtagonist lives on desert planet? Check.\r\nDiscover that they're indeed Force-sensitive? Check.\r\nHan Solo and Chewbacca escorting our heroes to destination? Check.\r\nA cantina featuring a cantina band? Check.\r\nMentor figure (Obi-Wan in ANH, Han Solo in TFA) killed by villain? Check.\r\nBattle of Death Star (Yes, I'm calling Starkiller Base a Death Star)? Check.\r\nDoes big ball of death get destroyed? Check.\r\n\r\nRey is indeed a Force-sensitive individual, but throughout the movie, she is just as good a pilot as Han Solo, is able to use a Jedi mind trick with ease, and easily overcomes the villain (Though it could be argued that due to Kylo Ren's injury from Chewbacca, he was weakened). There better be a damn good explanation as to why Rey is so strong with the Force when The Last Jedi is released. Anakin and Luke required training to become a Jedi, Rey is basically a pro with little to absolutely no training.\r\n\r\nFinn... Though I did enjoy the idea of a Stormtrooper defecting from the First Order and eventually helping out the heroes, Finn got annoying quick. From cringe-worthy lines to his constant \"Gotta get away from the First Order\" state of mind, he should have been a more battle-hardened individual who eventually became disillusioned with the First Order. His more cowardly approach to defecting wasn't very well-executed. But I gotta admit that the relationship between him and Poe Dameron was well-done. Didn't feel forced, just felt natural. Him standing up to Kylo Ren in a duel made me respect his character a lot more. His battle with the other Stormtrooper was just amazing. I'm honestly hoping his character develops more in The Last Jedi.\r\n\r\nI liked Poe Dameron from the get-go. From being a smart-ass to Kylo Ren to taking out multiple TIE Fighters, Poe is definitely a welcome new character to the Star Wars universe. Especially BB-8, just an absolute ball of cuteness. BB-8 was one of the two new characters that really stood out to me. Funny how Star Wars manages to make you like the droids so much.\r\n\r\nHan Solo and Chewbacca play a substantial role in this film. Han Solo's death was beyond tragic, just seeing an iconic character we saw develop from a selfish, Force-denying individual to taking charge in dire times (putting his life on the line). Once Han Solo yelled out his son's name, I knew his time was up. Leia, now a General, doesn't really get much time to shine. She and Han have been broken up for some time now (I'm guessing since Ben Solo became Kylo Ren), but their bantering still remains. C-3PO (now with a red arm) and R2D2 (in low power mode due to Luke's departure) are basically given minimal roles in favor of BB-8. Luke Skywalker made an appearance in the very final moments of the movie, but does not utter a word. Just seeing his expression when Rey hands him his father's lightsaber was more than enough. \r\n\r\nA quick summary of other characters: Captain Phasma, a more useless female version of Boba Fett. Maz Kanata, a color and gender-swapped Yoda who somehow manages to obtain Anakin's/Luke's lightsaber. Supreme Leader Snoke, a mysterious figure leading the new Empire (sorry, First Order) and first appears as a hologram (like the Emperor). General Hux, deliverer of a Hitler-like speech to his space Nazis. \r\n\r\nKylo Ren. In my opinion, Kylo Ren is the best part of the entire movie. Sure he worships his deceased grandfather Anakin Skywalker/Darth Vader and flips out into extreme tantrums, he is more than just an ordinary one-dimensional villain. He worships Darth Vader because he wants to carry on his legacy of killing the Jedi and achieve his intimidating status of being a ruthless individual. He is torn by both sides of the Force. He is indeed strong with the Force, stopping blaster shots in mid-air, freezing people in-place, and can probe the minds of others as a method of torture. His unstable crossguard lightsaber is appropriate for his uncontrollable anger and conflicted state of mind. Once he killed Han Solo, there is no hope for him returning back to the Light. He became a full-on evil person. I'm ready to see the damage he will do in The Last Jedi.\r\n\r\nThe action/set pieces were very well-done and that opening sequence with the raid on the Jakku village is one of the best and most chilling moments in all of Star Wars. The Battle of Takodana and the resulting battle was phenomenal and seeing Poe take out multiple TIE Fighters make him an exceptionally skilled pilot, even moreso than Luke. The final battle between Rey/Finn and Kylo Ren didn't feel choreographed at all, just felt like a battle between novices, unlike the highly-choreographed kicks and flips and lightsaber-twirling present in the Prequel Trilogy. Rey and Finn leaving Jakku in the \"garbage\" ship and the whole sequence through the Star Destroyer graveyard was beyond phenomenal.\r\n\r\nThough The Force Awakens does indeed take steps forward to move the franchise forward into a new direction, it takes several steps back into familiar territory. And yes, it feels as if I have been ripping on this movie, but in my honest opinion, The Force Awakens is a solid entry to the Star Wars franchise. The action set-pieces were so well-done, the nostalgic factor of the Original Trilogy is prevalent, Kylo Ren proved to be a well-developed villain with room for improvement, and the relationships between the characters feels so organic and fluid-like, as if they're all cohesive with one-another.\r\n\r\nMy Rating: 7.5/10.0",

      "synopsis": "Luke Skywalker has vanished. In his absence, the sinister FIRST ORDER has risen from the ashes of the Empire and will not rest until Skywalker, the last Jedi, has been destroyed. With the support of the REPUBLIC, General Leia Organa leads a brave RESISTANCE. She is desperate to find her brother Luke and gain his help in restoring peace and justice to the galaxy. Leia has sent her most daring pilot on a secret mission to Jakku, where an old ally has discovered a clue to Lukes whereabouts. The First Order, led by the evil Kylo Ren, is landing stormtroopers to attack a small village, as Poe Dameron meets with Lor San Tekka in a hut. He is given a small bag containing the map to Luke Skywalker. Kylo Ren orders the stormtroopers to destroy Lor San Tekka's entire village and takes Poe captive. Captain Phasma, a stormtrooper wearing chrome-plated armor, leads the attack. Kylo Ren wears a black mask and uses a red, fiery lightsaber. Poe's X-Wing is damaged so that he cannot escape, so the pilot puts the map in a rolling droid unit called BB-8. He fires at Kylo Ren, who uses the Force to block a blaster bolt. As Dameron is captured, the troopers massacre the prisoners, but one stormtrooper FN-2187, refuses to fire. Meanwhile BB-8 rolls away across the sands, narrowly escaping capture. The droid runs into Rey, a young scavenger who is barely surviving on Jakku. Rey scavenges parts from old wrecks of Star Destroyers on the sands of Jakku, and exchanges them for food at Unkar Plutt's scrap yard. The marks on the walls of her hut indicate she's been on Jakku for a very long time. She rescues BB-8 from a Teedo scavenger. She can understand his beeps and whistles, and offers him shelter for the night. On the First Order destroyer, Poe is unsuccessfully interrogated by the First Order. Kylo Ren is called in to use his Force powers to extract information from Poe about the whereabouts of the map. Poe resists, but ultimately divulges that the map is still on Jakku in his BB-8 unit. Meanwhile Captain Phasma confronts FN-2187 about his behavior on Jakku. She orders him to take his unused blaster in for inspection and report to her division and ultimately reconditioning. Instead FN-2187 decides to run away. He needs a pilot to escape the star destroyer, so he rescues Poe, and the two board a black First Order TIE fighter and escape. Poe renames FN-2187 as Finn, and expertly pilots to an escape while Finn fires the ship's blasters. The fighter is hit by lasers from the destroyer and crash lands on Jakku. Finn has ejected but it appears Poe has gone down with the ship leaving only his jacket. Finn wanders across the desert discarding his stormtrooper armor. Eventually, he arrives in Niima Outpost, the town where Rey trades scrap for food. While Finn is looking for water in the town, he sees Rey being accosted by two of Unkar Plutt's henchmen who are trying to make off with BB-8. He begins to rush to her aid, but before he gets far, Rey handily fights off her attackers using her staff. Clearly, she can handle herself. BB-8 spots Finn looking their way, and tells Rey that he is wearing Poe's jacket which they assume is stolen. Rey chases Finn down, knocks him to the ground and confronts Finn about the jacket. Finn tells them that Poe was captured by the First Order and that he helped him escape, but Poe was unfortunately killed. BB-8 is saddened and rolls off , but Rey is excited and impressed, and assumes Finn is a resistance fighter. Finn lies, telling her he is indeed with the resistance. Rey excitedly tells Finn that BB-8 is on a secret mission. Finn tells her BB-8 is carrying a map to Luke Skywalker and Rey is even more impressed, declaring that she thought Skywalker was a myth. BB-8 returns and alerts Finn and Rey that they are in trouble. First Order stormtroopers are now looking for Finn and the BB-8 droid. Stormtroopers chase Finn, Rey and BB-8 through Niima Outpost and TIE fighters are called in and begin to bomb and strafe the town. To make their escape, they steal a \"garbage\" vehicle to escape the First Order. It is the Millennium Falcon. Rey takes the pilot's seat while Finn mans the guns. Neither is confident in their abilities, and their lift off is rough, destroying a substantial portion of the town as they try to get off of the ground. Finn is able to shoot down a pursuing fighter, but the guns are hit and locked in a position that prevents him from taking out the remaining fighter. Rey flies through the wrecked ships in the desert of Jakku, occasionally scraping through the sands as they try to keep low to confuse the TIE fighter's tracking. Rey takes the Falcon into one of the Star Destroyers and just as the pursuing fighter locks onto their ship, she turns the Falcon out into the open, and performs a flip which allows Finn to fire successfully at the remaining fighter, taking it down. They head off, away from Jakku, and on toward the wider galaxy. Not having flown in years, the Falcon is not in good repair, and almost immediately requires an emergency patch. Rey begins repairing the ship while Finn admits to BB-8 he is not part of the resistance, but is still able to convince BB-8 to tell them where the Resistance base is. The Falcon is then captured and pulled into a larger ship. Finn is afraid they have been recaptured by the First Order. As the Falcon is boarded, he and Rey hide in a secret compartment, but the boarding party is actually Han Solo and Chewbacca. Rey knows the history of the ship, and how to repair and fly it. Han is impressed, but the ship is then boarded by two more smuggler parties. Han is trying his hand at smuggling again, this time by carrying some menacing Rathtars. Han tries to talk his way out of his debts with the two smuggling groups while Rey and Finn escape. Rey tries to close blast doors to save Han, but instead opens the doors to the Rathtar containers. The Rathtars attack and eat the smugglers and almost get Finn, but Rey saves him by closing a door on the creature's tentacles, severing them. The heros escape in the Millennium Falcon and leave their attackers behind. The new-found allies travel to the green planet of Takodana to seek help from Maz Kanata, an orange skinned alien. There they are spotted in the cantina by both First Order and Resistance spies. Kylo Ren sends forces to re-capture the map. Finn, still fearful of being recaptured by the First Order, admits that he is not part of the Resistance and decides to run by joining a crew heading for the outer rim. Meanwhile Rey is drawn to the lower floor of the cantina by the sound of a girl crying and opens a box to discover Luke Skywalkers lightsaber lost at Cloud City. When she touches the lightsaber she experiences a frightening vision. The dream has the voices of old Jedi like Obi-Wan Kenobi and Yoda. It flashes by quickly. She sees the hallways of Cloud City, a vision of Skywalker and R2-D2, a vision of Kylo Ren surrounded by bodies, thrusting his saber through the chest of a mysterious figure, a vision of herself being abandoned as a child on Jakku and finally she sees Ren pursing her in a snowy forest. On Starkiller Base, a snowy, mountainous planet, General Hux addresses legions of First Order stormtroopers. He angrily declares the death of the Republic. The planet has a massive trench around the equator, and a continent-sized aperture. The base fires a massive red beam from the center of the planet, traveling across space, and splitting into four separate beams which destroy individual planets. We see crowds of people on populated planets look up into the sky to witness the conflagration as their planet is destroyed. Rey is frightened by her vision and refuses Luke's lightsaber, running out into the forest of Takodana. Finn and the others look to the sky as the red beams can be seen destroying the other Republic planets. The First Order begin landing troops, including Kylo Ren's V-winged ship. Maz gives the lightsaber to Finn. As the stormtroopers attack Finn uses the lightsaber to fight back, but is knocked down by another stormtrooper (unnamed, but popularly referred to as TR-8R). The stormtroopers capture Han, Chewbacca and Finn. Rey tries to use the blaster given to her by Han Solo, but inexperienced and frightened she fumbles with the safety and fires wild shots giving away her position. Overwhelmed she runs deeper into the forest. BB-8 follows, and she tells him to go further on while she tries to fight off their pursuers. Kylo Ren tracks down Rey in the woods. He chases her through the forest easily fending off her desperate attempts to fire on him with the blaster. She backs away, but he stops her, using the Force to hold her still. Ren uses the Force to read her mind and discovers that she has seen the map to Luke Skywalker's location. He decides he no longer needs BB-8, so he knocks her out and carries her off in his ship, as Finn watches. The Resistance X-wing fighters arrive, finishing off the last troops. A troop ship lands carrying General Leia Organa and C-3P0. Han and Leia are reunited, but their relations are tense. It is revealed that Kylo Ren is actually their son. The heroes return to the Resistance Base, where Finn is reunited with Poe Dameron, who was not killed by the crash on Jakku. BB-8 is reunited with R2-D2 and C-3P0, but R2-D2 has been in shut down since Luke left many years before. The Resistance fighters begin to plan an attack on the Starkiller Base to avoid being wiped out. Finn wants to rescue Rey, and claims he once worked at Starkiller Base and knows how to knock out the shields. Han and Leia say their goodbyes as the X-wings led by Poe Dameron prepare to attack a weak point on the base. As they part Leia asks Han to bring their son home if he sees him. On Starkiller Base, Rey wakes to find her self locked in an interrogation chair like the one we have seen earlier in Poe's interrogation scene. Kylo Ren and she converse, and he removes his mask, revealing his face to her; he is a young and handsome man. Ren uses the Force to read Rey's mind. He senses her lonely life on Jakku, her dreams of a far away island and the closeness she feels towards Han Solo. She reacts with hostility but seems unable to keep him from reading her thoughts. When he tries to extract the information about the map from her mind, however, he runs up against an unexpected barrier. Rey is not only able to resist his further probing, but pushes back into Ren's mind, and tells him that he is afraid that he will never be as strong as Darth Vader. Ren is shaken by this and by her obvious strength with the Force, and he runs away to meet with Snoke in search of guidance on how to proceed. Kylo Ren and General Hux are scolded for not retrieving the droid, and Ren's inability to crack Rey's mind, by the Supreme Leader, who is only revealed as a massive hologram of an old and scarred man seated on a throne towering over them. Rey now understands that she has some Force talent, and uses the mind-trick power to escape from the stormtrooper guarding her cell. She sneaks through the Starkiller Base to the hanger to escape. Meanwhile, Han and Chewie come out of hyperspace on the planet in order to evade the shields, and crash land in the snowy forest. Finn reveals he does not know how to disable the shields; he only came back to rescue Rey. They capture Captain Phasma and force her to lower the shields. Finn, Han and Chewbacca head off to find Rey, but quickly discover that she has freed herself when they spot her scaling a wall of the base. They rush to meet her. She is surprised that they would come back for her, and embraces Finn when she learns from Chewbacca that it was Finn's idea that they come to the base to save her. Poe and the X-Wing fighters arrive and begin to land torpedos on the weak point, but it is not enough. Han and Chewbacca improvise a plan to plant explosives to blow it up instead. They split up to lay explosives in separate locations. Kylo Ren finds that Rey has escaped and is very angry. He searches the base for Rey. He stalks off onto a catwalk where Han spots him. Han approaches him on the catwalk, calling him Ben. He asks his son to return with him, and Ren offers his lightsaber, but then activates it and kills his father, pushing him off into the pit. Chewbacca, having watched the entire conversation, fires on Ren, hitting him in the side, and then detonates the explosives. Kylo Ren confronts Finn and Rey in the snowy forest. Ren is bleeding from his wound, but ignites his red fiery saber to fight. Rey raises her blaster to fire on Ren, but he throws her against a tree with a Force push and she lies unconscious in the snow. Finn rushes to her aid and then uses the blue lightsaber to fight Ren. Finn quickly finds himself outmatched. He manages to touch Ren with the saber, but this only enrages him. Rey is revived by the sound of Finn's screams as he is burned by Ren's saber. Ren easily disarms Finn, tossing the saber off into the snow. He then uses the Force to pull the lightsaber to himself. It hurtles towards him but then flies past. Ren turns to discover the saber in Rey's hands. They begin to fight. Rey initially fights unsuccessfully and desperately, and begins to run from Ren. He pursues her and pins her against the edge of a cliff. Ren offers to teach her the Force, but this only ends up reminding her to tap into its power. She closes her eyes for a moment of meditation and then attacks Ren with a new vigor and power. She rapidly gains the upper hand, extinguishes Ren's saber and cuts him on the arm and across the face. Meanwhile Poe Dameron and the X-Wing pilots fly into the Star Killer base trench, destroying the rest of the base. The planet begins to collapse and explode. A chasm opens between Ren and Rey as the planet continues to fall apart. Chewbacca arrives in the Millennium Falcon to pick up both Finn and Rey. The Falcon and X-Wings escape as the Starkiller Base explodes. Back at the Resistance base, Leia and Rey embrace in sadness, standing apart from the celebration of the rest of the Resistance base. Back at the Resistance Base, R2-D2 awakens and reveals the missing part of the map to Lukes location. Finn is still unconscious, and Rey tells him goodbye while he rests. Rey and Chewbacca leave in the Falcon, Rey taking the pilot's seat. They fly to the planet indicated by the map, where Rey carefully climbs a rocky island. When she reaches the top, she finds an old cloaked and bearded Jedi with a metal hand. It is Luke Skywalker. Rey wordlessly offers him the lightsaber.",

         "When I saw what the idiot Abrams did to Star Trek, I was furious. When I learned that he was going to direct the latest Star Wars movie, I knew exactly what would be the result; a total abortion of a great franchise, just as he did Star Trek. Abrams once again shows his true colors by exploiting the work of someone else, and then totally destroying it. Abrams philosophy is \"All we have to do is take the original movie, change a few character names, and then put it up as a new GREAT IDEA.\" Sorry, it doesn't work this time. In a horrible rip off of the first Star Wars movie that premiered in 1977, Abrams takes EVERY plot idea, relies on Disney marketing to hype the movie to death, and then delivers a total failure of a movie complete with horrible actors (Harrison Ford is the exception) and trying to rely on effects to say, \"Hey, look what I can do!\" A few highlights: CAUTION: MAJOR SPOILER ALERT, however Abrams spoiled the movie before I wrote this review. During a storm trooper invasion a map was hidden in R2 Rolie Polie and pursued by the bad guys. During a storm trooper invasion, plans were hidden in R2-D2 and pursued by the bad guys. Vader Junior holds a guy up by the throat wanting to know what happened to the map.

A group of rebel forces flies down a trench in order to shoot at the death star's weakness and destroy it. R2-D2 and 3PO had NO meaning in the movie at all. Their appearances were only there to be able to say that they've been in all Star Wars movies Luke Skywalker finally shows up at the end of the movie, which was the obsession of the stupid plot, only to say NOTHING, but stare at the girl attempting to hand him his light saber. The movie ended before we heard the phrase, \"I am your father.\" I would have vomited all over the theater floor if this had come about. Why people hire, support or even give J.J. Abrams any kind of recognition is beyond me. He's a horrible director and total thief of classic work. This time however, he can't blame his stupidity on an \"alternate time line\" as he tried miserably in Star Trek.",
         "Just awful is all I can say. A sanitation storm trooper,, who was at a invasion? A sanitation storm trooper who knows how to sword fight? Just clueless. I did not like this at all, my children did not like this, my grandma did not like this, Time lines seem to not fit, we got a old princess lea, but the technology hasn't been improved, or the old craft has not been upgraded to new technology. The found the falcon on a junk planet, but yet it's fully operational after 40 years, do they have eternal power sources, i don't think so. The end of the show was even more worthless, Luke was on what appears to be earth? and on a island in the middle of the ocean with no food or water or shelter. lololmao. Things must be getting pretty desperate in Lollywood for them to be pumping out this garbage.",
         "Following the mass-marketing campaign extraordinaire, I truly was fooled into believing this was a fantastic movie before I saw it. I believed the hype, that this was a Star Wars returned to form.....It is not! Story-wise it falls short of the prequels, never mind the original films. It truly is a Disney Star Wars. It's an almost sickeningly safe corporate exercise in entertainment with none of the original edge & flare/excitement. The original was based on old Saturday morning swash-buckling matinée series, with heroes & beautiful heroines. This Star Wars gave us a flat-chested car mechanic who looks like a teenage choirboy, a ham-acting ex-storm-trooper & Princess Leia re-imagined as a General. It's just soulless & flat & scared of its own shadow! Basically they've taken the original story, sucked all the sexiness out of it & punched & squeezed it into a corporate 'Disney' box. All stories must have accessibility, they must allow you to buy into the imaginings & in this 'The Force Awakens' fails miserably as it has hacked clumsily away at the origin story to suit its new safe Disney Star Wars universe. Booo!",
         "This movie was exactly what I expected it to be. A safe, unimaginative, nostalgia-filled cash grab. I cant exactly blame Disney or Abrams for taking the safe route after the backlash Lucas got for attempting to do something new, but I was still surprised at exactly how safe they decided to stay. Nearly everything is a rehash of episode 4. Same plot, same characters, same factions, even another death star. There is a painful lack of exposition. Nothing is explained about the state of the galaxy or what happened after episode 6. The viewer is not told what the New Republic is, not told what the First Order is, what the motivations of either party are, who Rey is or why she so good at everything. I know this is the first in a new trilogy, but that doesn't excuse bad writing in this movie. There is zero world building. Even the musical score is lackluster, something I figured for impossible in a Star Wars movie. For all the hate he gets, Lucas was a master world builder. I genuinely enjoyed the machinations of Palpatine within the Senate, the political scheming of the trade federation, and the build up to the start of the Clone Wars. It made the Star Wars universe seem so real seeing a functioning government and the power struggles within it. Abrams' entry in the series is devoid of all of that context. And the lesser for it. I was seriously surprised at the lack of criticism the is movie received in the days and weeks after its release. Star Wars fans ripped into every. single. little. flaw. in the prequels, yet this movie was getting a pass on major deficiencies. I even went out to see it two more times just to make sure I wasn't missing any hidden dialogue or bits of exposition. Nope. Even now, nearly a year after its release, its still being called the best Star Wars movie by many people. I don't understand it. Star Wars is supposed to be a fantasy series, and maybe I'm wrong, but world building and exposition are supposed to be important parts of fantasy writing. How the movie with arguably the least exposition and world building is being hailed as the best is beyond me. Bottom line: This a decent action movie, but a sub par Star Wars movie.",
         "JJ Abrams! This huckster is the shining example of all that is wrong with Hollywood. Zero talent, zero entertainment value, zero creativity and definitely no artistic integrity. Actually if he ever reads this interview he will laugh out loud. He thinks all these concepts are dated. All he cares about is cash and remaking and rebooting. No wonder he is either called Mr Rip off or Jar Jar Abrams. He and Disney fit one another. RIP Star Wars.",
         "For those praising this film, Star Wars Episode 7 is a despicable corporate product of a movie, that leeches off the imagination of the man who created its universe, while simultaneously giving him a giant middle finger by erasing all remnants of his Prequel Trilogy and turning the franchise into a vehicle for pandering fan service and a \"progressive\", feminist agenda. Episode 7 is nothing but glorified fan fiction made by a corporation desperate to get a return on their investment. With years of careful risk-benefit analysis, they were able to produce a film that upset the least amount of the rabid, vicious \"original fan base\" as possible. So \"fans\", you got everything you wanted. George Lucas, and the prequels are but a memory and you get all your original toys back, with just enough new crap to fool you into thinking your experiencing something fresh. You'll see the next 20 Star Wars movies and you'll get everything you begged to have, but you'll never be surprised. When Lucas wrote the script for A New Hope, he wasn't trying to please anyone but himself. He wasn't feeding a hungry mob everything they wanted, he was crafting a story that he wanted to see told on film. After 6 great chapters, he finished his story. So enjoy Disney's Star Wars movies until the end of time, but just remember that you're never going to see a film series so daring, ambitious, and above all, entertaining as George Lucas' Star Wars. Now, onto the aspects of this travesty that I fundamentally stand against. 1. A Star Wars Movie Without George Lucas Is Not Star Wars George Lucas didn't just have a part in the making of Star Wars, he CREATED it. Star Wars wasn't a collaboration that incorporated the imaginations of many different people. It wasn't an adaptation of someone else's work. Star Wars is solely the product of one man's imagination. Sure, tons of people worked on the films, but the entire Star Wars universe is George Lucas' vision. The uniqueness of Star Wars is that it all comes from the mind of one, incredibly creative man. Episodes 1-6 are the official Star Wars story as told by the man who created it. Any other story is, by definition, an imitation. Lucasfilm can try all they like to make these new movies look and feel like the real deal, but the truth of the matter is, they will never be the genuine article. Lucas' quirky touch is what makes Star Wars special. Without it, it's just another disposable sci-fi franchise. 2. Every Decision Was Made By A Corporation. The Force Awakens is a focus-grouped, market researched, PRODUCT that reeks of corporate control. After acquiring Lucasfilm, Disney had this film made so they would make their money back and then some. Storytelling was absolutely secondary. And the conception of the film isn't the only glaringly obvious corporate decision in Episode 7. EVERY major decision in the film was overseen by Disney and Lucasfilm. The new characters in particular reek of corporate greed and agenda pushing. The main character is a female and the secondary characters are mostly played by women or minorities. Disney will champion these casting decisions as a progressive triumph, but the truth of the matter is that these new characters exist purely as a PR move. Congratulations, your SJW street cred is through the roof, but I will never support a movie that uses someone else's creation as a platform to help their brand. 3. It Panders To A Vocal Minority Of \"Fans\" It absolutely sickens me that this movie deliberately ignores and actively mocks the prequels. George Lucas spent 10 years of his life crafting those films, and millions of people loved them, but the executives at Lucasfilm and Disney were so afraid of the pathetic internet trolls that they became one themselves. All the marketing of \"The movie you've been waiting for since 1983!\", \"It's all real!\", \"The magic is back!\"... it's all a ploy to appease a vocal minority of sad losers that couldn't stand that Episodes 1,2, and 3 tried new things. Even the title of the movie is a shot at the prequels. \"The Force Awakens\", as if those 3 massively popular movies somehow put the force to sleep. Once again, all of these decisions are corporate based. As a result, we get a two hour apology tour. They hear people complain about dialogue, so everyone becomes an over-acting spunk machine. They hear people complain about politics, so they ax that aspect entirely. Basically, they hear people complain about the prequels, so they do everything possible to remove them from memory. \"We hate George Lucas and the prequels too, see?\" Because the vocal minority of whiners is more important than the majority of people who love Lucas' entire saga. It's almost shocking how disrespectful Lucasfilm has been to prequel fans and Lucas himself. Almost. 4. This Is A Troubling Sign Of Things To Come. The Force Awakens ushers in an era of prostitution for the Star Wars name. With Episode 7, Disney has learned that they can make whatever they want, and as long they do exactly what the \"fans\" tell them, they'll have a cash cow that never dries up, and they'll never have anyone complain. After all, fans are getting everything they want, right? Well what about those of us that want to see NEW things? These corporations don't care about us. New ideas could upset people, so innovation loses over imitation. The Star Wars story ended in 2005. It's time for something new. Boycott the rest of Disney's Star Wars fan-fiction, and maybe we can prevent Star Wars Episode 7: The Force Awakens from being the movie that killed the blockbuster.",
         "**SPOILER ALERT** Wow, this movie was an identical to is predecessors... nothing new here Check list: Young Jedi on a desert plant - Check! Death star - Check! Resistance pilot flying through the tunnel to destroy the death star - Check! Crappy robot with secret message - Check! Han Solo - Check! Evil dude covered with black mask - Check! But what really annoys me, is that a young Jedi who 30 minutes ago thought that The Force is a myth and Luke is a legend learned how to use the force in 1 day and defeats the evil masked guy who is training in the force his entire life....",
         "I will never forget seeing Star Wars Episode IV for the first time in 1977. What an awesome film it was. I've been a fan of the Star Wars universe ever since. It was with great excitement I watched the latest episode VII. As usual the movie began with the scrolling text laying out the current scenario. Already at this point it seemed a bit weak and very similar to previous plots. It did not take long to begin predicting what would happen in many of the scenes. I often blurted out to my family, \"don't tell me they're going to copy that scene from (insert scene from other episode) here.\" My wife would say \"Oh no, they would do that.\" They did! I was able to predict events and even dialogue nearly verbatim because the movie continually reused the twists and turns of previous installments. My wife who is also a Star Wars fan agreed wholeheartedly with my ho-hum reaction. Our son (also a fan) left less than 30 minutes in. I won't go into all the details of how the movie stole so much from the previous films as you can surely read them in other reviews. I wanted so much to enjoy and love this movie as I did all the others, but honestly it was boring. Whereas I've watched each of the previous Star Wars films numerous times, I seriously doubt I will ever waste two hours watching this one again. I can't imagine how it was possible to take such a fantastic imaginative story like Star Wars and make it this boring. How is it possible that not one new idea sprang up in someones mind in the ten years since the last episode? There was no character development to speak of either. I really can't think of one takeaway from this film that would be beneficial to watching any future episode either. Dull, unimaginative, and boring best describes the movie. I'm a little upset that more was not done with the opportunity to add to such a brilliant legacy. I'm not sure what JJ. Abrams was thinking and I can't understand how George Lucas allowed this cinematic travesty. I have never been so disappointed in a movie before. Edited to add: I have now gone and read some of the other reviews here. It seems that EVERY review I saw is rated 1 out of 10 with the odd 4 or 5, so how is it possible this movie has an 8.3 average??? Something smells odd here.",
         "I wouldn't have taken the time nor the effort to post a written review of this movie were it not for the suspiciously inflated IMDb score of 8.5. Curious, I scrolled through the first 20 PAGES of reviews and counted exactly 5 positive ones. The many negative reviews gave it one star explicitly to balance out the ridiculous score it now has overall. I will do the same and I urge everyone else who gave it 5 stars or less to amend your review and give it a one star rating instead. The IMDb books are cooked. I'm not a conspiratorial person by nature but with so much money at stake I have to believe that the House of Mouse might have had something to do with it. At any rate I would honestly rate it a 6 out of 10. But my sense of fair play bids me give it only one star.",
         "Why o why after almost 40 years is the same exact movie recreated as the one from 1977 ? This so called blockbuster is an exact copy of episode 4 with little bits from 5 thrown in to fill the 2 hour running time. Even the soundtrack is more or less the same. I can understand the fans wanting something that securely sits in the star wars universe, but a 100% exact copy ? What is the point of this movie, what is its audience ? Most people, even the kids, will have seen the original many many times on TV, in home cinemas or on the small screen that's in front of you in tourist class when flying long haul, there is no need for a copy. Really annoying is the political correctness in this movie, here we have a black main character and a Hispanic side kick, of course all the evil is done by white men, so the Asians are missing , so you can be sure that the replacement for a character that's killed off in this episode will pop up next time and be Asian, o my. Near the end of the movie i found myself shouting \"look at the size of this thing !\", but not in an amused , but rather annoyed way. If you like things being blown up, stormtroopers still missing everyone with their \"Peeew peeew\" blasters and gender neutral toilets, go see it ! Otherwise just look at episode 4 yet again.",
         "I have just watched the film after weeks or being too nervous . After the 30 minutes of franchise related adverts ,the trailers started .A constant flow of good vs evil franchise films starting with London has Fallen ,Captain America ,Civil War, Star Trek ,X- men . Seriously this constant flow of formulaic drivel has become laughable .Time to try something different perhaps . The new characters in the film all seemed very light weight ,there was no real character development at all for Finn . I didn't appreciate the way that every significant character seemed to just bump into each other regardless of where they landed . The discovery of the LightSabre was also a very questionable scene . Another criticism was the situation between Leia ,Han and their son now choosing to work for the evil Empire . They seemed to accept the situation a little too easily for my liking . The acting of Domhnall Gleeson was pantomime camp . The scene where Rey discovers her powers and then uses then was atrocious . The scene showing the death of Han was over thought and you could see the outcome from a mile off . The obsession with Death Star Super weapons was boring and the usual split action scene of space battle / significant character battle really has become an over used cliché . I never enjoyed one scene in the whole film . I am truly broken hearted ,and what the hell was that final scene of Rey holding a light sabre and Luke facing her .It was nothing more than a scene devised for an 80s style flyover scene reminiscent of Clash of the Titans (original). My rating 2/10",
         "This movie was like one of those tribute bands playing cover versions on the nostalgia circuit. You feel as if you have seen and heard the original and much better version and this is just a replica and a fake. Why would be surprised though? Disney is famed for having no talent. How many versions of, Hunchback Of Notre Dame, Captain America, Bambi, etc etc. has this company churned out? Yup, so why should they now start to create something new or exciting now? To make matters worse, the cash hounds did not notice that: No one can magically master the force in a day... No one can simply scan the cosmos and find a space ship just like that (er, space is like er you know kinda big place) The troopers are clones and are all alike so no one cannot be black and just for fun here is another one: on a raid and assault to retrieve plans (see I told you it is a rip off) you do not take a sewage cleaner soldier with you... Fine, you got the leading girl, the black trooper and the cute robot (now available at authorized dealers, outlets and websites for purchase...costing you $$ even though they are Made in China and cost 3 cents to produce) but for me four things come to mind: I am boycotting Disney going forward. That is right, you can call it Marvel, Lucasfilm, Pixar whatever I am out. I am boycotting JJ 'Master Hack' Abrams and producers Tommy Harper and Ben Rosenblatt going forward for being money hungry dream destroying douches and finally will never ever again trust the media and reviewers again. You are all exposed as frauds.",
         "I put the spoiler alert... but there is little to spoil here. It's just something that should never have been filmed. It's my fault, a friend of mine warned me. And I remember I didn't care, \"it's Star Wars, I even enjoyed the I, II, III... When I see the logo and the music starts... they should really try very hard to ruin it for me. What can they do so bad?\" Well... They destroy everything Star Wars was about: The Force as a mystical thing? Now it's just \"superpowers\", and you don't need to train. You have them, that's all. And even a spoiled brat with daddy issues has, sometimes, more powers than Yoda or Palpatine... Of course, only sometimes. Sense? None. They go for a map to find a guy that run away (and for some reason left a map???) and the reason is... is... why is that important to find him? Specially when there is a new Death Star to be destroyed? No reason at all. Because it's Luke. That's it. Dark side vs Light side? Now, the \"new heroin\" beats the bad guy without any training, because she's really angry. I guess, in some place, Palpatine was laughing \"yes, use your anger\"... But in this new Star Wars is OK, she has superpowers, that's all. You don't need calm to control the Force and, in fact, it's the bad guy who gets tempted by the light side... WTH??????? Consistency with TRotJ? If the Rebels won, shouldn't the \"bad guys\" be the new \"rebels\"? No, they are pretty much the Empire. What happened? Why? Don't expect any answer in the flick. Somebody told me it's supposed to be explained somewhere. I don't care. If you need web pages or books just to explain the main plot of a movie, that movie is really bad storytelling. Period. Great villains? (Vader, Maul, Palpatine...) Now the villain is a kid with anger control and daddy issues, some pathetic little kid not even stormtroopers respect. They give them more \"superpowers\" than Yoda and Palpatine together, they made him kill the most iconic Star Wars character, just to try to make him look bad-ass... And yet, you just want to ask him for him lunch money. Just pathetic. The character and the effort of Abrams to make him charismatic. The first time we saw Vader he just walked, looked around... and we knew you shouldn't mess with him. No need for superpowers. That's called being \"charismatic\". This guy is the new Jar Jar, but worst. Jar Jar wasn't meant to be scary. And stupid. The poor guy wants to be like Vader... The same Vader that saved the day at the end of the OT and ended up being a good guy???? That Vader???? Adventures? as we already know the plot of the movie... not so much. Great settings? A desert. Woodlands. That's all. Even if you didn't like the episodes I, II, III, you have things to enjoy: Naboo, Coruscant... Here... NOTHING. No new design to awe you. TIES, X- Wings... that's all. The Galaxy just got really, really small. The first minutes, with the Star Destroyers in the desert, are OK. The rest... I could only thing \"please, I really want this to end already\". It felt like a 10 hour movie to me. The only thing OK was Solo and we all know how that ended... My brain just couldn't understand why the Star Wars music was in this B-Rate bad pilot for a TV series. And the worst of all, when it ended... The silence in the cinema. And i felt... dirty, but emotionally flat. I don't feel anger towards the movie or Abrams. I didn't feel anything. With the pass of the weeks I ended up feeling something: sadness. I really can't understand why people with half a brain can say this is not a disgrace and even argue is one of the best. I really can't. For me... it's just the end. I'll enjoy the first 6 movies and try to forget this disgrace. I really felt dirty when the movie finished. Disney can forget about my money. And I write this several weeks after wasting my money for this... thing.",
         "Well I finally went to see the movie, with a total of 5 others in the theater! As I feared, the force has fallen asleep. This was pathetic as I kept seeing the same story, the same roles, doing the same things and everything else as it was before. Heck, even the animated chess board on the Millennium Falcon was activated (and probably right back to where it was left 30 years ago)! OMG is this the best they could come up with? Really? Hiding underneath the floor/deck in the MF, is that all they can think up? Oh but hey, the MF has a new radar dish on it, rectangular shaped vs round...30 years allowed for that significant advancement. The XWing fighters are still the same, after 30 years? Even the US Air Force upgrades to better technology in 30 years. Even the alien band playing looked very familiar in the dark café/club....Where was the Rancour? (sp?). Even an evil alien there transmitting 'top secret' information...oh so boring, boring! We have a masked bad guy with dark powers and all the rest... Really! OMG this was boring and painful to watch. The movie previews for other movies before this sleepy rehash were more interesting! And a big cavern/hole for someone to fall down into... I guess Han Solo/HF said kill me please, I can't take this same old drama again after 30 years. I could go on and on, and I'm sure it's all been covered by other reviewers but at least I have said my part. JJ, a major disappointment, pathetic that this is all you could come up with. And Mark Hamill/LS didn't even say a word, how silly. I won't be buying this on BluRay and I won't bother to see the next movie. Yawn, the force is putting me to sleep, darn mitochondria (sp?) are acting up again, laughing at me for spending money to see the same old over again!",
         ".. after Mel Brooks in Spaceballs. J.J.Abrams should have stuck to something he does not kill. The Force in this case. If there would be justice, this movie would never have been created due to copyright infringement. Except that those rich enough can buy up anything, strip it from the essential values and present a much worse version, erasing the past. The original from 77' was a classic: reinvention of the sci-fi genre, storyline, visuals, morality. This one was obviously hyped by global branding worthy of the 21st century. And that's exactly the issue: a 10 for marketing, but a mediocre 6 for the actual product, the movie, which in my book means a 2, just to pull the odds straight on a fair voting result. Here's the why: 1. Storyline: an EXACT copy of Episode 4, the first Star Wars movie ever made! Poor hero(ine) coincidentally meets droid that holds plan that is key to master plan - meet Han Solo / Chewbacca - meet forces of good \u2013 fighting forces of evil where black-masked prime-evil guy turns out to be family member \u2013 while fighting evil dude on bridge, planet-sized planet-destroying machine needs to be destroyed, before it erases all the good guys - fighter plane fight after disabling shielding device - shooting in tunnel - last-minute destruction of monstrosity by hitting it with a few loose guns at its core, which is practically unprotected. Everything is EXACTLY THE SAME in this sequel, almost 40 years after having made the first such movie, when the whole story was still original! This obviously shows the intent to address the second and third generation of kids, the children of those who saw the original. It adds absolutely nothing however in originality. 2. Casting: having said it's a rip-off, it doesn't stop there. Aged actors from the original movie (Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Mark Hamill, Best Friend Chewbacca) line up to remind us that this IS Star Wars. This time around however to appeal to the \"elder\" generation: those who were kids when they first watched SW and should now feel connected enough to keep bringing their kids to the remaining two episodes as well.. The younger actors (Finn, Rey, Kylo Ren) however are just a joke. While Finn is the funny guy who needs to appeal to insecurities in all of us and never takes off his surprised-look mask (despite chopping up half the galaxy while he's \"doing the right thing\"), Rey is the next-gen copy of Luke Skywalker, except it's the 21st-cent politically correct (female) version that speaks as if she just left drama class, but despite the haughtiness of noblesse, feels the need to stomp around like a fishwife. Unlike the \u0084old Luke\", she is a modern control-freak, the emancipated girl-power type, sweat dripping in buckets by the effort of balancing femininity with the pseudo-liberal BS of \"equality\". Literally the actress is overwhelmed by her role and she simply overdoes it where most would have failed anyway, but better casting would still have saved some face. Third in row is the hysterical spoiled brat Kylo Ren, who sounds quite cool while still in his mask, if only he would not behave like a 5 year old who is easier manipulated than a puppy and looses the sinister image as soon as he takes off his mask and starts smashing furniture at the slightest setback. Reminds us of the same mistake made with using Hayden Christensen who played Anakin Skywalker turning from naive kid to hurt adolescent in Episode 3. Shouldn't that have been a sign for J.J.Abrams not to make the same mistake of taking away coolness from a Jedi?.. Breaking kitchenware will hardly appeal to any 21st century kid when the prime-evil character needs a touch of coolness. I don't even go into detailing the new \"wise\" CGI character of the 21st century politically-correct (female) version of Yoda, a passing whim with not a fraction of Yoda's charisma, despite being 1000 years of age. Oh, the glasses..yeah, I guess that makes her wise. Just shows how poor of a job the director did, if a character needs glasses to gain some respect from the viewer. Maybe a tattoo like \"I'm the smartest chick around the block\" would have been even more obvious J.J., on her forehead! To sum up the cast(rat)ing change: while almost 40 years ago we had a kid with hidden talents and a strong sister who finally melted by the charms of a bounty hunter, with the most bad-ass black-masked Evil of all times, J.J.Abrams now gave us panicky Finn, angry Rey and hysterical K-ren.. Just shows you Hollywood does not want role-models kids could look up to but gives them excuses for being like a wet rag. 3. Dialogues and character development: repetitive, simplistic jokes that were trendy when they first appeared by Spielberg in the eighties in the Indiana Jones franchise. Are they still cool 30 years later?.. If J.J. Abrams partners with Spielberg in the future, I would understand his urge to comply with the Master of Hollywood's flat directing style at the cost of authenticity, but for everyone else it's time travel backwards and not in a nostalgic sense. The movie and the reviews show that it pays off to totally remake a movie with no originality, poor acting, not even using minor storyline techniques to show anything new, brainwashing the audience to even reviewing it positively and not even to be punished for it. It's cheap, it's a disgraceful abuse of an original idea and all the energy put into the original movie and makes me wonder why this should be allowed in the first place. At any case, it robs a whole generation that grew up with Star Wars from its past, to replace it with a cheap remake.",
         "Repeat same story line from previous episodes that consisting of the following a twin was born (a boy and a girl), there are two bad guys who are Sith Lords the bad guys are building an artificial planet that is also a very powerful weapon the good guys will fight the bad guys with a few planes and is good enough to finish off the artificial planet. It is always that Sith Lords work in pairs, and refused to learn the lesson that two will always lose out to all the Jedis. And the Sith Lords always like to build an artificial planet, despite learning that the idea will never match a few good planes bombing its energy core. This really came at an expense on the quality of work and story of Disney.",
         "a vapid and uninspired exercise in funneling cash from me to Hollywood, Abrams and the synagogue this was the new template for making money. take someone else's work and reshoot with minor variations and call it a new episode. Lucas cashed in and sold out and sadly does not care anymore. The old actors were also desperate for cash so sold out and showed up. The reviewers and media also dared not be honest and were blinded by cash. It is up to us to at least learn from our mistakes and deny episode 8 the success to send a message to Disneywood that we are not losers.How by boycotting the next 12 episodes, offshoots, producer and this terrible director.",
         "There is literally nothing in SW:TFA that is not directly lifted from the first 3 Star Wars Movies. In those, a fascist empire (headed by a masked weirdo) wanted to conquer the world. Two children were hidden, both of whom had latent magic powers; and a weapon of mass destruction was the target of the rebellion's attacks. The funny thing is, the trilogy culminated with a destruction of the aforementioned fascist empire and the WMD. So guess what the imaginative folk at LucasFilm do... They write a formulaic plot which has two children with magic powers; and a weapon of mass destruction wielded by a fascist empire. It's just a complete recursive reboot. Can they not think of story lines anymore? This is the dumbest movie I've ever seen. Oscar Isaac should be ashamed of himself.",
         "They forced Star Wars to return and as much as any film it makes no sense. Last we saw Star Wars the rebels won. No one bothered to tell director JJ Abrams. They are now rebels again. Luke is hiding and doesn't want to be found (but left a map behind anyway har har), but why? Don't think about it because there is no answer. Bad acting, bad or no characters and typical remake problems. Just the choice of JJ Abrams shows you what Disney intended to do: take money and return deliver less than zero. IMDB, why can't we give a zero?",
         "Really enjoyed Marvel's Star Wars. It has everything you could possibly want in a Star Wars film. -Teenage Severus Snape throwing temper tantrums with a red lightsaber? Check. -Heil Hitler? Check. -Young discount ginger Grand Moff Tarkin? Check. -Orange Edna Mode? Check. -Discount Tatooine? Check. -Complete lack of cool new planets/landscapes/settings in general? Check. -Character designs that look like they belong in Harry Potter or Men in Black? Check. -\"You got a boyfriend, a cute boyfriend?\" Check. -Exact same plot as Episode IV? Check. -Overload of coincidences to move the plot along? Check. -Oh look, Chuck, there's the Millennium f***ing Falcon just sitting there. How convenient. Check. -Complete reversion of character and story arcs that essentially undermines and invalidates everything that was accomplished by the end of Episode VI? Check. -Completely forgettable score? Check. -Sound mixing/editing that slightly alters the sound of established things such as: the opening credits, lightsabers, and the Millennium Falcon? Check. -Ms. Mary Sue-Rey who knows everything about everything, including the Millennium Falcon, doesn't know it made the Kessel Run in 12 parsecs, not 14, so that we can insert another completely contrived and unnecessary piece of fan service? Check. -No Jedi character(s)? Check. -Totally generic Marvel-y Sith villain dude who is basically Thanos but looks like a cross between Azog from The Hobbit and a mutt from Mockingjay? Check. -Annoying, semi-urban sounding sidekick who does nothing but provide sh**ty comic relief? Check. -Out of character, comedic relief buffoon version of Chewbacca? Check. -ANOTHER Death Star but it's cool cuz dis one is bigger? Check. -Iconic character killed by whiny adolescent Severus Snape in the b*tchiest way possible? Check. -Said iconic character's story arc consisting of smuggler scum to hero war general, back to smuggler scum to dead. -Fan service so heavy handed that it's basically just directly copying scenes from the original trilogy? Check. -Red arm C-3PO to sell more toys? Check. -Metallic Stormtrooper Brienne of Tarth? Check. -Adeptly manipulating the Force with no training whatsoever? Check. -A lightsaber \"calling\" to you like a wand in Harry Potter? Check. -Force-sensitive individual skillfully wielding lightsaber with no training whatsoever? Check. -Non force-sensitive individual wielding lightsaber with no training whatsoever and not cutting his own arms off? Check. -Ground-breakingly (literally) stupid deus ex machina to end our absurd lightsaber battle? Check. -Laughably cheesy reveal of old hermit Luke Skywalker? Check.",
         "Disney's 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' is thoroughly derivative and ultimately trendy. This movie was a complete and utter disappointment, and a somber harbinger of worse to come.",
         "I've been a Star Wars fan since I was a young boy. I don't know every corner and crevice of the Star Wars universe, but I know it quite well so I was pretty excited about a new film. Well, let me just say that I am very disappointed with J.J. Abrams and Disney. They had the opportunity to create something fresh and meaningful and an chance to add to the story but instead they recreated A New Hope with a few new characters and far less appeal. Way to go Disney!! I won't go into details since there are a ton of YouTube videos and articles on the Web that already do that, but to put it all in a nut shell, The Force Awakens is a film we have all already seen. The only thing that is new is some in your face political correctness. I will not be going to the theater to see the follow up films, and will wait for them to come out on Netflix. I know I won't be missing much if anything at all.",
         "He works hard for the money, sooo hard for the money, he works hard for the moneeey and still can't get it right!!!!! (all rights to copyright holder Donna Summers) This thing is so bad that they would not even admit that it is a remake. They presented as a new episode. Yes, another orphan on a desert planet with a sewage scrubbing clone soldier who is nothing like his progenitor and is wondering (like us) why he was sent on a raid when there were sewers to clean up back wherever he came from (he was already mixed up looking at photos of his ancestor who looks nothing like him, imagine how confused he is now.. so confused that he rebels against his boss)... And just to make this money sucking abomination so 2015 cool make our black and female (anyone watched Ghostbusters 2016)? Nothing against women or blacks mind you love them all but JJ Abrams go do some community service you are so predictable and untalented. Thanks for ruining Star Wars. Thanks to JJ Disney Star Wars is now as unhip and uncool as a Donald Drumpf cold sore STD mouth-to-mouth kiss",
         "There may be spoilers in this write up. I originally gave this movie a rating of \"5\", based solely on it's very good 3-D effects. After thinking about it though, I realized I was being way too generous considering that once the 3-D version runs are through at the movie houses, we'll only be left with standard viewing versions. In light of that, I knocked my rating back to a \"2\". You can read a lot of the other low rated reviews to find many of the issues I have with the poor casting, the director's vision(?), and the sad acting, so I won't bother going there. What REALLY bugs me about this movie is that it does not continue the Star Wars saga. In 1977 we were introduced to this wonderful, new universe. At sometime we were promised a 9 movie collection, with 3 films focused on the now, 3 more delving into the past, and a final 3 taking us to the future. The present went off without a hitch. The past was finally shown to us after an awful 16 year delay. When those 3 films ended in 2005, who would have thought it would be another 11 years before we got a glimpse into the future. Finally, that time has arrived, only to find there seemingly is no future since this movie only represents a retelling of the 1977 original dressed up in modern technology and a sad mix of new and old characters. What should have been over and done with in 20 years has now taken 39, with 2 movies still to go. What's worse, is that now I have no idea when the next installment comes out if it will actually be a continuation of the saga, or just a sad remake of \"Return of the Jedi\". They seriously need to fire the director, hire some real writers, and get this story back on track."
