      "synopsis": "Jake Cullen (Bill Kerr) is babysitting his grandson at his house in the rural Australian outback when a massive and unseen razorback boar attacks him, smashing through his house like a high-speed freight train and dragging away his grandson to devour alive. Jake is accused of murdering the child and while his account of the events are met with high skepticism, he is acquitted due to lack of evidence. The event destroys his credibility and reputation however and he vows revenge on the boar. Two years later, wildlife reporter Beth Winters (Judy Morris) journeys to the outback to document the hunting of Australian wildlife to be processed into pet food at a derelict factory. While driving at night, she is driven off the road by two local thugs, Benny and Dicko Baker (Chris Haywood and David Argue respectively), who attempt to rape her only to be chased off by the same boar that killed Jake's grandson. Beth attempts to take shelter in her car, but the hog rips off the door, lacerating her groin with its tusk before dragging her out to be eaten. With no witnesses, her disappearance is subsequently ruled an accident resulting from falling down an abandoned mine shaft after leaving her wrecked car. A few months later, Beth's husband Carl (Gregory Harrison) arrives in in Australia to search for her and encounters Jake, whom Beth interviewed during her initial report. Jake refers him to the local cannery where he meets Benny and Dicko whom he convinces to take him along on their next kangaroo hunt, only to be abandoned by them when he spoils a potential kill. Carl is then attacked by a herd of wild hogs, spurned on by the giant boar, who chase him through the night and force him take shelter atop an abandoned windmill. The next morning, the hogs succeed in knocking over the windmill, but Carl is saved by landing in a pond at the windmill's base that is too deep for the hogs to cross over. Once the hogs leave, Carl attempts to make his way back to civilization, all the while suffering from dehydration inspired hallucinations before finally reaching the house of Sarah Cameron (Arkie Whiteley), a friend of Jake who has been tracking and studying the local hog population and the only one who believes his story of the giant razorback. While recovering at Sarah's house, Carl forms a friendship with her and learns that something has been causing the wild hogs excess stress, leading them into unusual behavior such as increased aggression and cannibalizing their own young. Meanwhile, after learning that Carl had seen the razorback, Jake sets out for the pumping station and manages to shoot it with one of Sarah's tracking darts. He also finds Beth's wedding ring in the boar's scat which he returns to a grieving Carl, who resigns himself to returning home. After overhearing a radio conversation suggesting that Jake knows what really happened to Beth Winters, Benny and Dicko, fearful that Jake is attempting to implicate them in her death, attack him at his camp, breaking his legs and leaving him to be killed by the razorback. His remains are later found by Sarah and Carl, along with marks in the dirt made by Dicko's cleaver. Realizing that the brothers were responsible for both his wife and Jake's death, Carl attacks Benny at his and Dicko's hideaway, interrogating Benny by lowering him into a mine shaft before leaving him to plummet to his death. As Sarah rounds up a posse to hunt down the razorback using the tracer Jake shot into it, Carl corners Dicko at the cannery when the razorback suddenly appears and mauls Dicko before Carl can shoot him. The razorback then chases Carl into the factory when Sarah suddenly arrives and is seemingly killed by the boar, who continues to pursue Carl even after being impaled through its throat with a broken pipe. In its maddened rampage, the razorback ends up damaging the cannery's generator which sends the machines running out of control. Carl lures the boar up onto a conveyor belt that throws it onto a giant fan, chopping it to pieces. After shutting down the machinery, Carl finds and rescues Sarah, who had merely been knocked unconscious, and the two embrace.",

         "Okay, the plot sounds ludicrous, doesn't it? A giant killer pig? Despite the apparent ridiculousness of the plot, this movie is better than one might expect. Beth Winters, a Canadian reporter, has come to the small Australian Outback town of Gamulla to shoot a story about the local dog food packing plant, which uses the meat of poached kangaroos in its product. When Beth disappears one night, her husband Carl arrives to find out what happened. Beth apparently ran afoul of the psychotic Baker brothers, who work in the plant. But crusty old Jake Cullen soon learns that Beth was a victim of a giant razorback, the same one that carried off his grandson years before and which he has been hunting ever since. The Australian Outback becomes an almost alien world - desolate, strange and scary where any form of undiscovered life might exist. You don't get to see much of the giant pig, admittedly, but then they didn't have CGI back in the early 80's. The real menace of this movie lies with the kangaroo poachers, two brothers who reek of malevolence and filth all the way through the film. They were truly terrifying, and the insane laughter of David Argue (playing younger and more dangerous brother Dicko) still haunts me to this day. Worth watching at least once.",
         "Razorback is one of the best Australian horror/action movies ever made. The direction is dazzling, the cinematography is truly remarkable and the cast is brimming with quality actors. Mysteriously, no one seems to care. There is no denying that Razorback's basic plot premise is pretty ridiculous. In short, a giant boar (a Razorback) goes on a killing spree in a small outback town. This is about as unlikely as a giant shark terrorising swimmers (\"Jaws\") or a wet Japanese woman climbing out of a television set (\"The Ring\"). My point is that even the most ludicrous storyline can be overcome by excellent film-making and this is certainly the case with Razorback. Razorback was the film that launched Russell Mulcahy's film career after making a name for himself directing music video clips for AC/DC, Queen and Duran Duran. Razorback reflects the same sensibilities that Mulcahy brought to his best video clips: frenetic pacing, flashy camera angles and stylish visuals. These qualities are almost disorientating during the film's action and horror sequences, making them all the more suspenseful and eerie. Mulcahy's dizzying direction combines brilliantly with Dean Semler's superb cinematography. Semler seems to thrive on barren landscapes and he captures the harsh beauty of the Australian outback magnificently. The scene with the wooden horse bobbing up and down on the salt flat is mesmerising, as is the entire sequence of Carl hallucinating in the desert. Put simply, Razorback is one of the most beautiful horror films not made by an Italian giallo master. The cast is equally accomplished, offering a smorgasbord of excellent Australian character actors. Judy Morris (\"Phar Lap\") does well as Beth, not being hampered too greatly by an American accent. Bill Kerr (\"Gallipoli\") seems to have appeared in every second Australian movie. He has one of his best roles as Jake. Chris Haywood (\"Muriel's Wedding\") is also memorable as the ultra vile Benny. American import, Gregory Harrison, does respectably as Carl and the late Arkie Whiteley is sweet as Sarah, a woman who inexplicably monitors boar movements in the middle of nowhere. The special effects still hold up reasonably well and the creature effects for the Razorback are great. I love the close-up of its eye in the finale. There is not much gore, but what the film lacks in blood, it more than makes up for with constant action. Razorback begins with an action sequence and simply never lets up. There are car chases, kangaroo shootings, beatings, home demolitions and that just covers the first half of the film. Razorback is not a particularly scary film, but it compensates for this with eerie atmospherics and relentless tension. In addition to the fine film-making, I also enjoy Razorback for its political incorrectness. The outback characters are arch stereotypes and just about every animal in town comes to a violent end. Benny and Dicko even run over Jake's dog for fun, which would be unimaginable in a film made today. Furthermore, the irony of an animal rights activist being eaten by a giant boar was not lost on me. Razorback is an excellent genre film that deserves much wider recognition. I wish the Australian film industry would make more films like this. If Russell Mulcahy's upcoming \"Resident Evil\" instalment does well, he should consider making the long overdue sequel to Razorback.",
         "Judging by the external reviews, quite a few people appear to hate this film. I can see why, but I think they're coming at it from the wrong angle. I see it as - intentionally - trying to send up the whole genre of vengeful animals horror flicks. In truth, neither sharks nor grizzlies, and certainly not razorback hogs, are smart enough to conceptualize, let alone carry out, acts of vengeance on humankind. The film simply takes the \"rules\" of this particular genre and applies them to a ludicrously unfit vehicle: a giant pig. And there are some pretty funny scenes, notably one where the monster eats a nasty watchdog that's chained to the side of a house; naturally, the corner of the house to which the chain is attached comes off and Joe Couch Potato is left sitting in a wall-less abode, staring quizzically as his television disappears into the outback. Treat it as comedy, and the film makes a lot more sense.",
         "This is one of those film that I decided to track down and buy because it was such a hoot. Great atmospheric scenes, a bit of gore and plenty of humour. I love it and I only paid Â£4.32 incl postage ! There's a lot of tricky night-time filming and very realistic killer pigs - if that hasn't hooked you then I doubt this film is for you. If you liked American Werewolf in London, get this and you won't go wrong. I don't want to be accused of padding but do an internet seach and you will always find great ratings for this film - it just seems to slip beneath the radar for most reviewers which is a shame because it deserves to become a classic for all the right reasons. Please add your comments if you agree - but remember to make it at least 10 lines OK",
         "Call me stupid, but this is actually one of my favorite horror flicks. The story's about a giant wild boar munching on Aussies in the outback. Our hero goes in search of his wife...she's missing out there. Many interesting ideas come forth in this movie. I especially like the kangaroo killing brothers Benny and Dicko (hehe). The way the movie portrays them is interesting, contrasting the life of the outback trash to the much more civilized life of Bill, the hero. I also enjoyed the use of weird settings(the desert with that \"horse\") to create atmosphere. Overall, I enjoyed this flick a lot, and I think most horror fans would if they look beneath the seemingly ridiculous plot.",
         "Razorback marks one of Australia's only successful forays into the horror genre, but it's certainly not without it's critics. It's negative reaction isn't unfounded, as Razorback is badly acted, has a trite script, utilises any number of clichÃ©s and has an overall 'deja vu' sort of feeling; but in spite of this, it still succeeds in being a fine piece of entertainment. A wild boar isn't the first animal you would think of to star in it's very own creature feature; but the idea actually works quite well, and it makes a nice change from the usual barrage of sharks, crocodiles and whatnot. This feature is also notable for it's special effects, which certainly aren't groundbreaking - but it ain't half bad either. In films such as this, it's usually shabby effects that end up letting it down; but the creature in this movie is surprisingly realistic! The plot is a familiar one, and it basically follows a gigantic wild boar that's on the loose somewhere in Australia. It's not exactly intelligent stuff, but it's a lovely premise for a fun ride. The film is directed by Russell Mulcahy, and it was made a year before he would have his big hit with Highlander. His direction is solid enough, and it's notable for the way that he captures the locations within the Australian outback. Some of the shots are truly breathtaking, especially the atmosphere ones that are filled with smoke. One thing you will notice about the plotting of this movie is the way that it swaps through different characters for it's main protagonist on numerous occasions. This is both a help and a hindrance to the movie as, on one hand, it ensures that the film stays lively and exciting; it also restricts the viewer from placing their confidence in the character as we don't get to spend a lot of time with them, which hinders it when it comes to the tension building sequences. This also makes the plotting of the movie inconsistent, which certainly isn't a good thing. One thing I love about Australian cinema is the way that it captures the accents and dialect, and this film is no exception to that trend. It's a lovely tongue to listen to, and that helps to make this movie more of a pleasure. On the whole, this film won't win any awards; but there's worse ways to spend ninety minutes of your life.",
         "\"Razorback\" perfectly captures the dirty, malevolent underbelly of outback Australia by mixing \"Jaws\" (on land) with \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\". After a Canadian reporter (Judy Morris) is slaughtered, her husband (Gregory Harrison) arrives in Oz to search for her killer. No points for guessing that her killer is a giant, mutated boar who has also, quite recently, dragged the grandson of a local kangaroo shooter into the night. Although the sweaty boar is a considerable threat, he pales in comparison to the threat presented by two deviant locals (David Argue and Chris Haywood). The boys, who are brothers, work in a hellish pet food factory which resembles the subterranean underworld depicted in Tobe Hooper's \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2\". These colorful miscreants/part time Roo shooters live to rape, kill, and abuse two-legged and four-legged creatures, and provide \"Razorback\" with a welcome spine of pitch black humor. Directed by rock video ace Russell Mulcahy (his feature debut), this is a B-grade winner that boasts some of the best photography (courtesy of Dean Semler) ever seen in a horror flick. The giant pig (by \"Brain Dead\"'s Bob McCarron) is seen intermittently and is not always totally believable, but the film's pacing and bloody surrealism more than compensate for this deficit. The score by Iva Davies is superb and the bloody attack sequences, especially in the uncut version, hit the bullseye.",
         "I liked the fast pace of this movie, and the grim atmosphere, greatly enhanced by the stunning photography: the world down under reduced to it's most barren and desolate face, soaked in weird colors and ghastly mists that seem to hide all kinds of unearthly terrors. The acting is a bit uneven, the ladies are just adequate, the two sinister brothers are tremendous and the leading male (Gregory Harrison) is like a math teacher turned into a hero despite himself. But somehow Harrison pulls it of, he actually has enough charisma to stay believable unto the orgiastic and a bit over-the-hill ending, which is an achievement in it's own right. On my DVD there was a bonus feature with a very interesting audio-interview with Harrison, who gave some fascinating insights on the making-of and on his becoming involved in the project, as well as on his own career. But why on earth not a VIDEO-interview, or an actual comment-track along with (parts of) the movie, now one has to listen for half an hour to a voice while watching an empty screen, that seemed like such a waste!! I would have liked to see what Harrison looked like nowadays (he sure was good-looking back in 1984, and I bet he still is!). Anyway, in this movie he did a great job, very physical indeed, for instance the whole section of him wandering endlessly through a sun-baked wasteland on bare feet, or falling out off a wind-mill into shallow water while (real) razorbacks crowded in on him, or personally fighting the monster on some kind of assembly-belt. According to his own words he suffered multiple minor injuries during the shooting and I can easily believe that. When in the end he has destroyed the beast and he stands up victoriously soaked in blood, it must have felt like a victory to himself too. And what about the ferocious monster, the giant razorback?? Well, as long as it stays in the distance, or stampedes through the image so that the camera hardly catches up with it, it's convincing enough: big and ugly and menacing. But when at last the close-ups can't be avoided anymore, it quickly looses it's credibility, as in so many pre-CGI movies, it then comes mainly down to a big hairy flip-flapping jaw and rolling eyes. To me that diminished a bit the supposed horror of the otherwise breathtaking climax. All in all this movie is great entertainment, with many very memorable scenes. I rank it 8 out of 10.",
         "In a small outback town a child is carried off by a massive wild boar, but the grandfather who was looking after the boy gets accused of killing the youngster. He tells that of a gigantic wild boar killed his grandson, but naturally the town's folk won't hear any off it. But in the trail there wasn't enough evidence to convict him so he's acquitted. Next a American female reporter who's an animal rights activist goes down under to get some interviews with some kangaroo hunters, but instead she comes face to face with the rampaging boar and disappears. The locals believe that she must have fallen down a mine shaft, but her husband Carl thinks otherwise and heads to Australia to dig up any dirt to what really happen. Da Da.. Da Da dadada... Get out of the water! Oops, wrong film. Sorry about that as I just couldn't get that Jaws theme out of my head. \"Razorback\" is what you can call Australia's answer to \"Jaws\", but instead this one is on land and we get one angry looking boar terrorising locals and out-of-town visitors. The two films do share some similar characteristics, but while \"Jaws\" plays it mostly serious I found \"Razorback\" the opposite. Well, it would be hard to get anyone to take the story seriously because of how ridiculously stupid it is, but that doesn't stop this stylishly, grim shocker from being entertaining. Well, actually that wasn't the case on my first viewing of this flick as I wasn't particularly smitten over it. Maybe I was in a grumpy mood at the time, but on this occasion I enjoyed the silly experience far more. The premise might cross into \"Jaws\", but the beginning also adds to the story - Australia's most infamous case of the baby that was taken by dingo, which still causes controversy today. The fella who penned this particular film Everett D Roche is probably Australian's most prominent screenwriter in the genre with such films like Patrick, Harlequin and Road Games under his belt. While, the story might be highly derivative there's enough imagination and excitement in spots to keep it from being uneventful. But there's one thing I can say about this production is that the thick style is all over thin substance. Who you can thank for that is a music video director making his debut in films - Russell Mulcahy (Highlander, The Shadow). He brought to the table an atmosphere that was visually stunning with its sprawling, desolate backdrop that has never been so eerily caught. Well lately, \"Wolf Creek\" did a good job on that aspect. But here there's a surreal quality about it with it's vibrant colour scheme and blanket of mist. The lighting composition is well staged with a visual goldmine exploding on screen with the spectacular shots of the horizon. The vacant outback simply spills off the screen that you just think that it's such a great backdrop for a horror flick. The expansive camera-work is swift in it's movement by capturing every frame with a certain amount of panache and the odd inventive angle and POV shot. The electronic score is effectively worked into the piece along with hissing sound effects that added even more to the unsteady, dreamlike texture. Since there is not much in the way of surprises, director Mulcahy ups the thrills and action in such an unyielding fashion to set the film alight. While, the gore might be lacking, the deaths are unpleasant and also thrown in some animal cruelty. What was surprising is that the since the spot light is basically on the mechanical boar - it doesn't look too bad, well towards the end it might lose some of the effect it created early on. But I have seen far worse. The performances are tolerable enough even with some eccentric yahoos who generated some agreeable humour. The script is purely senseless dribble, but there's some dry sarcasm, thick slang and a laid back attitude that works its way in because of the culture. Gregory Harrison is passable as Carl Winters. Bill Kerr is excellent as the stubborn boar hunter Jake Cullan who has a chip on his shoulder and who's crusade is to get the giant pig. Arkie Whiteley is lovely Sarah Cameron and Judy Morris is decent as Beth Winters. But the most memorable performances is the cheerful maniac brothers Benny and Dicko who are marvellously played by Chris Haywood and David Argue that add the wild and wacky feel to the flick. A highly spirited and trashy Australian knock-off that goes down well with a few cold ones.",
         "One striking shot follows the next in this monster B-movie, and the overall tone of the visuals is beautiful, I think. And there is some thick, intense atmosphere. In those departments it's so stunning that the many flaws can't ruin the film. The acting is OK all in all but there are some moments that make you want to put your head through the next wall. The action scenes and especially the ones with the razorback, a huge boar, are more or less comprehensible in that you get the basic idea of what's going on but all the crucial scenes happen between cuts, so the editing is jumpy, kind of like a TV edit. The worst example is the movie's finale and the destruction of the monster, which after an exhaustingly loud, dark, monotonous battle between man and monster plot-wise also ends on a ridiculous and schmaltzy note and so the film leaves you with a bad aftertaste. But those visuals, man, those visuals... It's kinda like a more extreme 'AlienÂ³'. Worse plot, more stunning visuals. What else could I do but consider this a new B-movie favorite?"
