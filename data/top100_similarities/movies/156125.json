         "This one picks in on the remake from 2010. I wasn't really satisfied with the remake because it went completely over the top. But here Jennifer Hills (Sarah Butler) is back under another name. Being in therapy with a group who all were involved in rape she slowly turns back into her bad habits, going out to kill the rapists. It takes a while before she goes berserk and you will see the best, read gory, parts of the 2010 version. When her new girlfriend is being killed by her ex-boyfriend it's time to search the guys responsible. The first kill is the one you will remember the most because she goes for a blow but not with a happy ending for the guy. From there on it's a bit of the same as in the 2010 version. Except that we do have a little message hidden throughout the movie itself. The victims aren't the ones being helped by the authorities. It's so weird to see Sarah turning into a sickie, especially towards the end when she thinks all men are the same, have been talking to her and in fact have seen her again the day before I watched this flick at a convention. Does this flick offer anything towards the franchise, to be honest it doesn't but t is still worth picking up. Gore 2/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 25/5 Story 2,5/5 Comedy 0/5",
         "I give it a 3 out of 10 for some brutal deaths and the fact that they brought back the girl from the first one. Other than that, this movie wasn't very good at all... Seems like the director is probably one of those \"low budget\" type of filmmakers that shoots stuff that airs at 2 am on HBO or Showtime... If you liked the first film, Then it's natural that you would want to see this, but trust me, this film has absolutely nothing to it other than very bland storytelling and a very low budget feel I was actually bored about halfway through the movie when I realized it was going to be nothing like the other movies, sure the deaths are brutal, but so what? They spend a few scenes trying to make you dislike a guy, they show him only a few times, and then kill him expecting the audience to actually care",
         "The first two entries in this remade series have been absolutely brilliant. So when I found out the director of the first two Steven R. Monroe wasn't going to be returning I was very disappointed. Wow what a difference a director can make. R.D. Braunstein takes over the helm for the third installment and things just completely fall apart. Admittedly he's been handed an absolute dud of a script by first time screenwriter Daniel Gilboy, but still a better effort than this would have been nice. I was glad to see Sarah Butler returning to her role because she was absolutely perfect in the first one. I suspect she didn't read the script though (or agreed before it was even written), because all this one did was completely ruin the character originally created. The format is completely changed, which is not necessarily a bad thing, a third one done exactly the same might have been pushing it, but if this was the best alternative they could come up with then things should have just been left as they were after two. The dialogue is terrible, especially from the police officers. At one point a female officer walks into a rape support group and starts deliberately teasing a man about the pronouncement of his name. This was absolutely shudder-worthy and unfortunately only one of many instances like it in the film. Every character is unbelievably annoying (yes even 'Jennifer Hills') and consequently where the first two films did such a good job of creating sympathy for the lead character and utter despise of the villains, that's non-existent this time around. An absolute misfire that should never have been made.",
         "\"I Spit On Your Grave aka Day Of The Woman\" remains one of those notorious horror classics from the '70's, like \"Last House On The Left\", \"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" and \"The Hills Have Eyes\". Like previous movies, it got a deserved and very well done remake a couple of years ago. The sequel (2013) was also surprisingly good. So we have 3 \"I Spit\" movies, 2015 we suddenly get \"Vengeance is Mine\". Let's start with the positive side: Sarah Butler (from the remake) returns as Jennifer Hills but she calls herself Angela (aka Angel of Death ?) and visits the shrink and a therapy help group. There are 2 very graphic and brutal torture / death scenes. The negative side: the characters are underwritten, and the story is kinda dull, we get a second rate version of the (far better) \"Death Wish\" series or an even accurate compare is the '80's movie \"Ms 45\". The problem is that with the other movies, you see the bad people do all these evil, unspeakable things and in the second half of the movie you really wish them a gruesome death. Here, that's not the case, you are briefly informed during one of the group sessions what they supposed to have done. And since it didn't happen to Jennifer herself, it doesn't justify her actions like in the previous entries. I read in a review that this is the entry with the most shocking gore. Well, I saw the unrated cut and just 2 scenes are mild compared to the excellent remake and the even more graphic Part 2. \"Part III: Vengeance is Mine\" certainly isn't a bad film, but it isn't as good and disturbing like the previous entries. If you like revenge movies, it's still certainly worth a look.",
         "First remake - I Spit on Your Grave (2010) - seems like brought some visionary people together. Cinematography and editing was brilliant, muted colors and mood was impressive, music and ambient sounds was influencing. Especially the cinematography and narrative on the first one was much better. It was a poetic, well balanced, lyrical rape / revenge masterpiece. 3rd one is a bit overdone. Since this 3rd one is not well balanced between rape and then revenge, it feels like a psycho girl torturing men for no reason... See its because there's no a phase of rape to draw you into the story as the first one does. It's not as strong as the first one to pull the audience towards the lead female character and feel the way her feel. The lack of balance of the 3rd movie causes the lack of empathy with the rape victims so revenge moments feel pointless somewhere deep in the mind. I highly recommend the first remake and even the second one - I Spit on Your Grave 2 (2013) - because they have much better way of telling the story, building the structure of the chaotic feelings and let the audience question the morals and feels the empathy with leading characters - stunning and talented females.",
         "Really dull and nothing like the other two that were already worse than the original and classic version. Second tire actors and poorly-written dialogues. If you like trash, then you will have a great time watching this one. It is hard to believe that producers and the director managed to make something that bad. The plot - if I can say there is a plot - is nothing but confusing. The victim seems to be a twisted freak. Rape has been gaining momentum in many cultures and this is important to help stopping violence against women. Even some well know schools have a problem managing this but this movie will not help at all. It is pure trash covered in some attempt to make justice. So, enjoy your banana split and forget the rest.",
         "This movie drags on & on without any payout. It follows the aftermath of the modern 'I Spit on Your Grave' where she stays in the cabin & has to deal with the corrupt sheriff & his accomplices. She spends much of the movie in a Psych chair detailing her unfortunate vacation she previously had. This film had nothing to offer - no good story line, little violence & basically focuses on the main character who at this point is 'damaged goods'. A complete waste of time - so boring I wouldn't even group this film with the others. It's just a 'PG' rated type film with a slow storyline. Disappointing would sum it up.... Well, that sums up the movie in a nutshell - but IMDb wants 10 lines of description before I submit. There really isn't any more to this film that needs discussion. A complete waste of time I think is a accurate description. If you want well-done disturbing horror movies, watch the first 3. I don't even know why they made this film - it's terrible for the reasons stated above.",
         "Because Sarah Butler starred in the first remake of \"I Spit On Your Grave\" and me not knowing this installment of \"I Spit On Your Grave\" had a different director from the first two I went into this one thinking it was going to be as good as the first or at least a little better than the second, I was wrong. While not perfect, the first was an absolute thriller. It had the edge of your seat thrill a horror/thriller should have. To me this installment was different, which isn't a bad thing, but it didn't have that simple straight up revenge is a dish best served cold attitude about it like the first one had. I think in horror/thriller films like these, when you start adding things it takes away from what the film is really supposed to be. If there were more violent and gore revenge scenes it probably would have been a better film. Perhaps they'll make a fourth installment starring Jemma Dallender and get back to the basics.",
         "Another dumb blunder by people who simply do not understand genre film and have no business making them. Apparently the geniuses who produced this said to themselves, hey, for all you fans of the original movies and the remakes before this, we thought you'd like a basic revenge drama, rather than a exploitation genre film. Ahhh, no. No, we won't like that. This movie will appeal to no one. Nobody. I don't even get what it is. It takes a classic exploitation genre and turns it into a boring lifetime channel revenge drama. A complete waste of time in every way.",
         "Rating it 7 is too much. Let me be clear on that. The movie from the start seemed pretty good. The acting was nice, the plot was really good and I loved how it broke the whole I Spit On Your Grave movie clichés. I loved the fact that it was something different from the other movies we have seen. With some great acting and some bad acting from supporting actors and some clichés, in the middle of the film I had decided that its probably the best from the latest three movies of the franchise, not going to mention the first one though. The killings were great and brutal. But the end of the film came so quickly, it was bad and made the movie one of the biggest disappointments in recent cinema! I have no idea what the film makers were thinking! How the hell did they write such an awful ending, thinking that its going to work?! I don't know, really.. It had great potential but by the end it was plain trash like the other films. The 7 rating from me is for how much I enjoyed the whole thing, objectively it deserves a five, maybe five and a half, and if it had a better, or maybe a good, ending I would have given it a 8.",
         ".... and pretty much falls flat on its face. Which is a pity, since as a reviewer who has been watching theatrical releases since the 1970s, up to this point the ISOYG franchise was one of the \"purest\" of the 70s style releases left on the planet. Notice that I am not saying whether or not this is a good thing - whether this style of visceral horror is \"your cup of tea\" is really up to the viewer. The point is that ISOYG entries 1 and 2 were true to the formula and, for purists, they delivered. This entry is strange. If you check the IMDb credits, star Sarah Butler, who pretty much has been carrying this series on her back, gets a \"misc\" credit at the end of the IMDb roll. Whattsup with that? This entry takes a sharp right turn from the formula -- never a great way to start a movie -- and relies instead on a lot of scholarly dialog and flashbacks to the earlier entries just to maintain a pretence of dramatic tension. Pa-leeze! The \"4\" rating may be a bit high, but Butler does have her fans and she deserves credit for holding screen interest.",
         "How is this possible?! I have seen WAY better movies with a lower rating = proof that the IMDb system is severely flawed and there are clearly people being paid to write positive reviews and give more stars than the film deserves but I guess we all already knew that. The only thing interesting about this movie were the flashbacks to the original which was actually really good. Everything was just bad in this one. The direction, the script, the acting. Woof. Would not recommend. Do NOT, I repeat, do NOT pay to watch this. Wait for it to come out on whatever streaming service you're already subscribed to and watch only if you literally have nothing better to do which should be never. If you never get to see this film, you will not have missed anything. I promise you that.",
         "I must admit that I was a tad excited about a third movie in this brutal series coming out and I was thrilled when I finally got the chance to sit down and watch it. But my expectations were equally brutally cut down in size. This third movie was nowhere near the same level of intensity, brutality and entertainment as the previous two movies. Mind you, that it is still a good enough movie to watch, just don't get your expectations up for it to follow in the same bloody footsteps as the previous two movies. It was nice, though, to have the Angela character (played by Sarah Butler) to return to the movie, although the character did seem sort of a spoof and a parody on itself, given the events in the first movie, and how she had turned out in the third movie. The story in \"I Spit on Your Grave 3: Vengeance Is Mine\" was fairly straight forward, albeit lacking a deeper content and a meaning that would be satisfying and fulfilling for the audience. The acting in the movie was good, as it has been since the first movie. And the special effects were great, also as they had been in the previous movies. And while this third movie didn't have as much violence as the previous two movies, then the effects and presentation of the situations were right up to level with the previous movies. There are some graphic scenes which will make you squirm - especially if you are a guy. However, the movie just lacked that special ingredient to make it a worthy third installment to the series. But isn't that the perpetual curse of sequels? They tend to drop in worth and entertainment the further the series continues on. I am rating \"I Spit on Your Grave 3: Vengeance Is Mine\" a mediocre five out of ten stars, because it just wasn't living up to my expectations on any level.",
         "If you are a fan of the series this one doesn't disappoint! So pop some popcorn and get ready for some Vengeance. It starts out a little slow but definitely gets going towards the middle and end. The first kill is by far the best. I had to replay the kill because I almost didn't believe what I saw the first time! Crazy! The second kill was also pretty good. It's great to see Sarah Butler back. She shows great strength and vulnerability in her acting and I find her a pleasure to watch. I also liked Jennifer Landon and Doug McKeon. I am surprisingly even a fan of the ending! I hope number 4 is in the works :) As far as revenge movies go (my favorite type) this one is high on my list.",
         "Loved the first movie, well shot and whilst it has flaws was a great revenge movie. The second one followed in the same style and again a decent movie whilst not quite as good as the first. This one though really is a straight to DVD bargain bin cash in. Loses the quality of direction of Monroe and totally lacking the atmosphere of the first two. Such a shame as it was a great idea to bring back the character of Jennifer but the film just doesn't live up to it. Anyone giving this a 9 or 10 must be involved in the movie making as it is really poor.",
         "I must say, after my big disappointment from the sequel, I didn't think I would really take the time to watch number 3. However, as soon as I saw that the wonderful Sarah Butler was thankfully back, and that the plot actually aims to continue the first film - I figured I'd give it a chance. Boy, am I glad I decided to do that, as \"Vengeance is Mine\" salvages any and all damage done by the previous sequel (which wasn't bad, simply unworthy). As the synopsis says, unlike no. 2 which was nothing more than a failing tribute (although to a certain extent fun to watch, don't rule it out yet), no. 3 is the actual sequel. Haunted by both the brutalizing gang rape and abuse she'd been through and her terrible violent acts of revenge, Jennifer (now Angela) is trying to cope with the world she believes she lives in - no friends, no altruism, always strings attached, and a blunt battle between predators and prey. Unlike the 2nd film, the acting in this one is as amazing as in the first, with terrific additions like Jennifer Landon as the neurotic Marla and Doug McKeon as the traumatized Oscar. While the first film was all about abuse and vengeance and crime and punishment, the 3rd aims to be a lot deeper and more philosophical. The police has a very central role in the plot, after having a minor one in the sequel and being non-existent in the first. Angela finds herself having to lie and hide in order to do what she defines as right, while her rage and frustration threaten to claim the lives not only of those guilty, but of others as well. The film criticizes not only the monsters who commit the crimes and the system that pathetically fails to punish them - but also the crossing of the line between justice and injustice. Vengeance is Mine was probably out to offer and upgraded plot. The actual acts of abuse receive no screen time, excluding Angela's flashbacks from the events of the first film. The film aims to show the conflict between the reality experienced by rape victims (a misogynistic world where men are either monsters, incompetent pawns or fathers of victims) and the reality that is actually out there, where the truth is gray and there are no absolutes. The victims who turn to violence are criticized as badly as the monsters who made them that way, and the system is criticized for its alleged successes as well as its blunt failures. All in all, unlike the first film, this one is not a plain vengeance film, and we often find ourselves wondering who the monster really is. While having a much deeper message, it fails to deliver the pure satisfaction given by the first film (although \"fails\" is probably a wrong choice of words, as it obviously had no intention of doing so). After the painful plunge of the 2nd film - the 3rd offers the salvation of the series. Not as good as the first, definitely way better than the 2nd. The added value is obvious, the acts of vengeance still immense, and the overall experience definitely worthy of the time spent watching.",
         "Let me just get right to it. I'm not a huge fan of this series, this and the first are the only ones I've seen. But I'll be honest, I was only seeing this for Sarah Butler. This one was sort of better than the first, she's kind of like a vigilante which is kinda cool, but they could of put some action scenes in kinda like Death Wish. I mean I guess I could say some of the death scenes of her victims where alright. At least Sarah was fun to watch, speaking of fun to watch, she was super sexy in that red dress let me tell ya. Overall, I guess a could watch this again, like on a rainy day if I have nothing else to watch. I give it a 3/10. For me, it's just alright but I like Sarah Butler, and she's the only reason I would watch this again.",
         "I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE 3: VENGEANCE IS MINE is another mindless hate-filled addition to the series, barely any different to the two films which preceded it. Okay, the formula is slightly different this time around, as the main character isn't raped at the outset, but the grisly revenge killings are, while the self-help circle material is frankly a bit dull. The problems with this film are myriad, but the weak writing is the foremost issue, with one-dimensional characters and tepid pacing throughout. For the sadists among us, there are some very graphic and nasty death scenes here, meted out to men who are more than deserving of their fate. Even so, this ventures into torture porn territory and would be quite disturbing if the CGI effects weren't so terrible. Elsewhere, lukewarm, occasionally histrionic acting also mars the experience, along with a cast filled with unlikeable characters, leaving this a sadistic chore for only the most hardened gore-seekers.",
         "I will certainly try to avoid spoilers in my review but have made sure to enter the spoiler warning just in case. I put off watching this series for a long time, I had read previous reviews both good and bad, I decided it was finally time to watch the trilogy. Knowing the first of the films was a remake I didn't have my hopes set too high (however I have not seen the original). I was impressed, I was disturbed, I felt for the character Jennifer Hills, I expected revenge and gore and the film delivered... by no means was it particularly innovative but I sparked emotion and that is important in a revenge/horror/gore flick. Part 2 was disappointing considering it was the same as the first film in a different location ... also I didn't feel as compelled to cheer for the victim character (I've already forgotten her name if that shows how well the movie was executed). I had about given up on the trilogy when I read the synopsis ... Oh what do we have hear? The return of Jennifer Hills, a character I enjoyed. Well heck, now I want o see it. I knew she couldn't possibly end up in the same situation as before so there as hope it wasn't going to simply be a rehash of the previous 2 films. I was excited, still felt some sadness for the Jennifer character, I really hoped we would see her struggle with the aftermath, maybe she would act as a counselor for other victims of abuse and rape, relive her story etc... but that doesn't make for an exciting revenge flick now does it ... I knew there had to be a vigilante angle... now I could only hope that she simply lost her mind and was to become a raving lunatic (Spoiler** Ya that's kinda what happened). Where this film missed the mark for me was from the get go every male character was played out to be the bad guy, even the good guys ... yes I get it, trust issues that makes sense and I really would have bought into it by the end had the Jennifer character met justice of her own ... The ending feels as though it can be interpreted a few ways, the entire story was just her fantasy and she will be set free into society to live out those fantasies (which is how I read it, and it certainly gives room for a 4th film)or that what we did watch actually happened and was now being recounted in therapy (because we do not know what happened with the officer in the park)... This is where I have the problem, to me she got away with it (either having served her time or having only had fantasies which she was about to pursue). They took an innocent character from the first film and made her the villain (which I fully support)but left her as the hero... I know this is all open for debate but I personally feel it would have been nice to see her go over the top, become what she once fought and paid the ultimate price.",
         "OK so the first 2 films of this franchise were women getting raped then going on a revenge rampage by killing the rapists in brutal ways, fast forward to this 3rd film and im glad to say they have a gem with this one. They have concentrated on the girl from the second film who is now in therapy from her ordeal and the twists and turns she goes through to help her deal with the emotional damage, with a clever twist that will leave you impressed but be warned there is some brutal scenes in this 3rd outing. This film has been well thought out and scripted better than first 2 films and its an outstanding performance from Jennifer landon. I spit on your grave 3 has got to be up there with most surprising films of 2015 and well worth a watch.",
         "\"Justice isn't something you receive, its something you dish out.\" Years after her attack and rape Jennifer (Butler) is trying to move on with her life. She is in therapy and joins a support group where she meets Marla (Landon) who changes her outlook on life. Marla convinces her that talking isn't the way to help victims like them. When something happens to Marla and no one is held accountable Jennifer decides to unleash her own brand of justice. The previous two movies were a little hard to watch. A graphic rape scene followed by a sequence of gory revenge scenes. They weren't bad but they reminded me of the Hostel movies. Not much plot and really just an excuse to push the limits of what they can put in a movie. I went in with that expectation to this one. I have to say that this was easily the best of the three. This movie had what the others were lacking, a story. This had more of a Boondock Saints feel then a Hostel how-shocking-can-we-be feel. There are some very over the top aspects in this but the story is something that keeps you watching, strange to say for a horror movie. I surprisingly liked this much more than I expected to. Overall, easily the best of the series. I give this a B.",
         "For a franchise that has subtle title like \"I Spit on Your Grave\", it certainly has no shortage of gruesome scenes. I'd even say it's a level above what most slasher flicks can pull off. Unfortunately, aggression alone doesn't cut it, the movie has a very touchy subject and it lacks any refinement to deliver anything consistent aside from random rage trip. In what seems to be a mix between vigilante and horror flick, the protagonist literally whacks people she deems evil. As one might expect this is far from rainbow and sunshine, it's pretty much one of the bleakest and profanity infested B-movie in this year. The unapologetic style might work for a bit, but it alienates the audience and certainly isn't a way to draw sympathy. It first tries to introduce the protagonist after abusive past, then it falls apart when she dives into insanity. Using a heavy theme isn't easy. Some other vigilante movies with female leads like Jodie Foster's Brave or even Jennifer Lopez's Lila and Eva, while not entirely perfect, but they do have some empathetic appeal. This movie has none of that and it doesn't really care. What it does have, in spade, is brutal carnage. It has some of the most surprising and striking gore scenes, and they alone might just warrant some viewing as legit slasher flick. However, the overly combative nature won't win any audience. At some points the intrusive thoughts are chaotic for the sake of being chaotic alone. This one is for gore purist only, it's a really aggressive rendition of vengeance premise and while it most likely attract the horror fans, it may not be appealing to casual viewer, especially if they're not familiar with the franchise.",
         "I feel like people are being too harsh on this movie. In my opinion this is a strong sequel and it only adds to the franchise, the franchise is now taking a different way and that is interesting. This film is not as brutal as the first two, but it has a fair share of psychological depth and action in it. This film is more about emotions rather different than the now classic rape-revenge scenario of this franchise. The third installment is all about bringing justice and vengeance upon those, who didn't get punished for their actions by the law. And in my opinion that is a very interesting aspect and a nice turning point for the series. In real life we have got a share of these injustices, when the law just turns a blind eye and chooses to ignore, or even worse, when the victim is made to be the perpetrator. Here we see a huge problem with these single genre franchises, people tend to be disappointed no matter what, somebody thinks this movie is taking away the essence of the series, some others think the franchise should remain unchanged and they just want to see the classic rape-revenge flick. I feel that we need to view this and other possible sequels with an open mind and understand that it is not clever to make a 3 movie franchise with every movie being exactly the same, that is like watching \"Saw\" and experiencing the very same traps every film. At least for me this movie felt like a good continuation of the previous films and this is going to keep the series alive. It didn't lack suspense, had little more depth to it, just different in a lot of ways, not a horrible sequel!",
         "I went into this movie after having really enjoyed the first two films; I was looking forward to seeing the aftermath of Jennifer Hills. The first two films followed different characters and their own stories of torture, rape, and murder, but now I would get to see how how Jennifer is coping. Sure, at first it sounds strange that the formula of the first two movies is broken, however I found it just as enjoyable, if not more so. The first half of the movie covers Jennifer Hills in her new life, where what has happened to her is still happening in her head; she can't escape her past, but she is trying. She meets a new friend who is angry and outspoken, having been the victim of some sort of assault herself. Together they bond over shared experience and Jennifer becomes emboldened with her; more aware of her own anger and her own power. After her friend disappears, Jennifer starts into the second half of the movie. The second half is more akin to the first two movies, although the catalyst for the stream of dead bodies is quite different. Now, Jennifer is in control from the start and she knows what she wants to do. Irrational or not, she is on a missions and nothing will stop her! The ending I was not quite what I would have wanted or else I would have given the movie a 9, but overall, it is definitely a great movie; assuming you enjoy revenge fantasy movies. This movie will speak to victims of physical, mental, or sexual abuse. I think Jennifer Landon and the writer did a great job of capturing what it's like to be a victim in horrific situations like this. I understood the character very well; the constant anger just beneath the surface; random murder fantasies from innocuous things; easily agitated all the time; introversion; cold, dead certainty. I understood how she felt, the need to do something, to explode in rage. Everything was more or less believable, the pace was good, and I enjoyed the discussions I had with others after the film. The gore was gory, the drama was dramatic, and the murder was murderous! What more could you want? Victims of any type of assault have to live with it every day of their lives and I like that they came back to Jennifer Hills to explore that.",
         "It's a sequel people, a continuation from the first controversial instalment that had viewers looking away from screens due to the sheer amount of blood, torture and obscenity. After the previous chapter, which felt all too familiar, they changed things up slightly. Following from the events of the first film, Jennifer ditches her career aspirations to become an assault hotline operator and attend group counselling sessions in order to heal her scarring experience. She develops a bond with a girl who is then mysteriously murdered. What does Jennifer do? She lures and traps these unpunished rapists/murderers and kills them in the only way possible...brutally. Stab a neck, slice a man's \"Crown Jewels\" (only way I could think of politely describing it) in half and even shoving a huge pipe and hammering it up someone's...well, you get the idea. That's all well and good if you have a sadistic mind, but I'm afraid that's only 7 minutes of the film. The remaining 84 minutes are bad. Just plain bad. Firstly, I actually found this film to be the most distasteful. Not because of the vivid torture scenes, which actually are few and far between in this chapter, but due to the depiction of men. Apparently we are all rapists and only live to have sex because it's the only thing we think about constantly. Nearly every male character is depicted to be disgusting, and it's offensively unrealistic. Clearly aiming for a female empowerment thriller, yet it misses and then some due to the horrendous one sided perspective. The screenplay isn't intelligent enough to make us sympathise with Jennifer, so it's just watching a woman kill men with a minimal amount of psychological analysis of her mental stability. She becomes disillusioned with society, unable to differentiate between well-meaning men and sexual predators. But the boring plot and unexciting dialogue never fully explores this. The acting was mediocre also. For a film that breaks its own formula, it feels more familiar than ever."
