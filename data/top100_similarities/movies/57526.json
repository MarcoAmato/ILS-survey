      "synopsis": "Jennifer Marsh (Diane Lane) is a widowed single parent living in a suburban Portland home with her daughter Annie Haskins (Perla Haney-Jardine). By night, she works in the FBI's cybercrime division with Griffin Dowd (Colin Hanks), fighting identity theft and similar crimes. One night, an anonymous tip leads them to a website called killwithme.com. The site features a streaming video of a kitten being tortured and killed. After the kitten's death, KillWithMe's webmaster (Joseph Cross) 'graduates' to human victims and makes their deaths correlate directly with the number of hits the site receives. At a press conference, the public is urged to avoid killwithme but, as Marsh feared, this only increases the site's popularity. The videos are recorded in the killer's basement and his various victims include a helicopter pilot (who is bled to death by injections of anticoagulant), a newscaster (burnt by heat lamps) and Dowd (killed by slowly increasing the concentration of sulfuric acid solution in which he is submerged). At first it seems the victims were randomly chosen, but this is not the case. The first two victims were chosen because they were part of filming or presenting the suicide of a junior college teacher. The teacher's unstable, techno-prodigy son, Owen Reilly, broke down and was admitted to a psychiatric hospital. When released, he decided to prove a point (that the public is insatiable for the suffering of others), as well as wreak vengeance on those he felt had exploited his father's tragedy. Dowd was killed because he came close to the truth of who the murderer was. Marsh, who figures this out, is soon targeted as well. Captured by Reilly, Marsh escapes her death-by-mulcher by swinging out of the way while dangling from the ceiling. She ends up breaking free and gunning down the murderer just as the other police show up, Marsh kills Reilly on his own website. As the film ends, the website receives numerous requests for a video of Reilly's death. ************************************************************************* Special Agent Jennifer Marsh (Diane Lane) is a widowed single parent living in a suburban Portland home with her daughter, Annie Haskins (Perla Haney-Jardine). By night, she works in the FBI's cybercrime division with Griffin Dowd (Colin Hanks), fighting identity theft and similar crimes. One night, an anonymous tip leads them to a website called KillWithMe.com. The site features a streaming video of a kitten being tortured and killed. The site cannot be shut down, as whoever created it, knew that someone would try to shut it down, and built into it a fail-safe: everytime the server is closed, a mirror server comes immediately up, in its place. After the kitten's death, KillWithMe.com's webmaster (Joseph Cross) \"graduates\" to human victims and makes their deaths correlate directly with the number of hits the site receives. At a press conference, the public is urged to avoid KillWithMe.com, but as Marsh feared, this only increases the site's popularity. The videos are recorded in the killer's basement and his various victims include a helicopter pilot (bled to death by injections of anticoagulant), a newscaster (burnt to death by heat lamps while cemented, up to his mid-thigh, into the floor of the basement); and Griffin Dowd (killed by slowly increasing the concentration of sulfuric acid solution in which he is submerged up to his neck). At first it seems the victims were randomly chosen, but this is not the case. The first two victims were chosen because they were part of filming or presenting the suicide of a junior college teacher. The teacher's unstable, techno-prodigy son, Owen Reilly, broke down and was admitted to a psychiatric hospital. When released, he decided to prove a point (that the public is insatiable for the suffering of others), as well as wreak vengeance on those he felt had exploited his father's tragedy. Dowd was killed because he came close to the truth of who the murderer was. Marsh, who figures this out, is soon targeted as well. Captured by Reilly, Marsh escapes her death by rotary tiller by swinging out of the way while dangling from the ceiling. She ends up breaking free and pinning down the murderer, and just as the other police officers show up, Marsh fatally shoots Owen on his own website. As the film ends, Marsh displays her badge symbolically and the scene closes with a shot of the dwindling chatter in the website's chat room, featuring the telling statement \"a genius died today\", as well as showing a couple of \"chatters\" that are glad the killer is dead and a final comment, asking whether the video could be downloaded. That was a way nice end to the story. But the reason why FBI Detective Marsh was involved was not thoroughly understood.",

         "The movie had a few things going in its favor. For one, it used reasonable technology and background, so the story wasn't far-fetched. Secondly, and most importantly in my eyes, it did NOT go for shock value. It didn't try to use gore to elicit a reaction from the crowd. Not to say that some scenes weren't rough on the eyes, but it was far from a Saw or Hostel. Thirdly, it honestly kept me on the edge of my seat for a good portion of the movie. And lastly, the ending does not drag itself out. It ends at the logical point. That having been said, this movie will not change your life. It's a little bit of a commentary on society, but moreso, it's just an entertaining movie to watch.",
         "Well, I can say one thing about this movie is that is was very original. Most of the pessimistic losers out there who are fans of 'Gorror' movies will cry, and complain that it was a rip-off of the Saw series. Yeah, yeah... whatever. In reality... THIS could ACTUALLY happen. And the saddest part, is that people would log onto the site to watch THAT happen. This movie was a little slow... It is not an action movie, does not have any nudity, no car chases, no monsters, no sex, no love triangle, no street fighting.. so the average movie-goer will find it lame, slow, and boring. I like slower movies, lets you think as you watch. Diane Lane was good, but not super. She has had better, no... much better roles. Joseph Cross plays a really creepy bad guy, with sick twisted emotions. The movie was not great, but is surely was not a bad film. I believe if you are a real fan of Murder mystery, police detective films, with some thriller thrown in, you would, or may like this flick. With ONLY 1 Hr. and 40 Mins. if someone complains about length, they need to get checked for A.D.D. or they need to stick to teen-age comedies like Strange Wilderness, or Meet the Spartans. Check this movie out with an open mind, don't let the pessimists cloud your idea of this film. It is an innovative film, with a good cast, and the shots of Portland, Oregon are not bad at all. I will actually give this film a 6 1/2 out of 10.",
         "Entertaining thriller about a crazed young computer geek who becomes the deranged moderator of his own \"Kill With Me\" live internet feed where he displays new victims being slowly tortured to death. The more hits he gets at his site, the faster the people featured on his webcam die. This is disturbing in making us realize what depths we've sunk to in our society, and what morbid curiosities can do. I especially liked that the 40-something Diane Lane is the star as the police woman who tries to apprehend the killer, instead of relying on the usual Jessica Alba or Sarah Michelle Gellar \"honeys\" of late. *** out of ****",
         "As I have stated before, I love scary movies even though I get frightened by everything. Untraceable caught my eye the first time I saw a trailer for it. The plot is very fast paced, and you will find yourself playing detective while watching. The best part of this movie is that it doesn't go for cheap scares, such as something jumping out or ominous music at key points in the film. If you can handle a little bit of gore, you should be fine. The ending won't blow you away, but you shouldn't be disappointed either. This is a solid film that isn't too scary, but it's no Muppet movie. Colin Hanks is solid as usual. The killer didn't quite meet my expectations on the creepy scale, but he is serviceable.",
         "With the internet and cyberspace so common in everyone's life today, plus with the reported upswing of crimes like identity theft and pornography on the net in it's own way \"Untraceable\" is very relevant and common with today's times. \"Untraceable\" a crime computer thriller that's set in Portland, Oregon it involves an investigative computer unit of the FBI headed up by a single mother Jennifer Marsh(Diane Lane). Interestlingly the unit comes across a website of a creep who broadcasts live torture and killings of hostage victims in various grisly ways live over the internet. The bloody catch is the more the web surfer logs onto the sick website, the faster and quicker the victims will die in the various forms of bleed outs, fried by hot mirrors, or seasoned by sulfuric acid. The drama only gets more interesting when the computer of Jennifer is hacked into by the sicko setting up for a dramatic finish and showdown encounter. Lane gives a fine performance as a serious investigative agent, and yet no matter how grisly that many scenes are the theme of net crime and hacking overpowers and gives a strong message of awareness even over the well liked and popcorn moments of torture and nasty horror. Overall \"Untraceable\" is not a bad flick nothing great, yet it's enjoyable and does hold interest by making us aware of the web crime and hacking identity problem.",
         "Diane Lane and a strong supporting cast make up for a \"been there-done that\" crime drama. The story contains a few original twists as well as a few serious implausibilities. Nevertheless, the direction, pace, and performances, especially Lane's and Bill Burke's, draw you in and by the abrupt conclusion, you are on the edge of your chair. Burke and Lane, as rival investigators, develop an interesting chemistry that builds through the film and is never compromised. Joseph Cross gives a creepy, effective performance as the deranged techno-killer. The fact that the story gives him such amazing capability to the point that you occasionally start rolling your eyes should in no way deter from his acting. All in all, nicely packaged if somewhat contrived; The story hinges on the fact that this \"wunderkind\" killer can continually crack every computer in his way, stay one step ahead of the law, and continue to capture victims for his morbid shows without skipping a beat. All that IS hard to believe, yet \"Untraceable\" was still satisfying entertainment.",
         "That is the one word I will tell you perfectly sums up and describes my opinions towards this awesome film and it's bogus reception. Untraceable was a suspenseful thriller with great action, fun death strategies, and wonderful acting, that has a ridiculous amount of unappreciative reviews and hate aimed at it in all the areas that a lot of people have no problems with in other movies. Diane Lane was a great actress in this film. As I have said, the performances are excellent, and she of course gives the best and she made the movie totally believable and enjoyable. While there were of course flaws, I found the story line and the movie itself to be great entertainment. I found myself yelling at the screen and telling the people in the film what to do, and I am not that interested in a film unless it manages to get my adrenaline up, which I find as a positive factor in most cases whilst viewing a movie. There were things I found predictable, and of course the film gets a little out of hand at times, which as I said, it's not flawless, but it wasn't meant to be, and most of the time I was so interested in the movie that I wasn't making any presumptions or criticizing the faults. This was a wonderful film, that is under appreciated and if you haven't seen it, I recommend you do if you are capable of being lenient on these sorts of films.",
         "This story of a crazed killer using hits on a website to \"assist\" him in his killings is a refreshing high tech twist on the what I call the \"killer-thriller\" type of film. Not all the computer gibberish is comprehensible to those of us--such as myself--who aren't computer geniuses, but the major or breakthrough plot points--the eye blinks for one, the early use of what is actually the GM Onstar system in her SUV for another--are carefully planted and credible. It's irrelevant to whom Diane Lane is married in real life, or who her mother in law is....what matters is that her performance here is top flight. She lets the makeup department avoid glamorizing her, and she comes across very convincingly as a 40 something woman professional highly competent in her job. I'm not a huge fan of hers (I recall her miscast role in the stinker \"Must Like Dogs\", but now I'm digressing, sorry) but her performance here is nuanced and top flight. Refreshingly, the filmic style is even vaguely evocative of those wonderful 1940's Film Noirs, with rainy nights and a generally dark patina. I hear Portland is a cold, rainy city, so setting the story there was a wise move for atmosphere. Some other writers have already made the point that is a bit amazing how the \"bad guy\" is sooo competent, and even hacks into her Saab's engine computer....but, hey, maybe its possible and even if it's not it still gives the film an exciting sequence. Not a masterpiece, but very much worth seeing....",
         "\"You want the scent? Smell yourself.\" Hannibal Lecter If you're longing for Lecter, get some good Chianti and watch Silence of the Lambs for the umpteenth time. The serial killer in the enjoyable Untraceable is not half as interesting as the cunning Hannibal, but then again the real interest is cybercrime, the Internet's ability to draw the world to a site, which if not regulated, can serve snuff as easily as sex. The menace of the Portland, Oregon, police and FBI is a cyber-psycho who tortures his victims on the Web in real time, all of whom die more quickly with each hit to the site. Although brutality is not as explicit as in Saw or Se7en, the film effectively suggests our communal relationship in cyberspace and ultimately our responsibility to restrict the criminal potential, admittedly an extreme case here. Diane Lane plays agent Jennifer Marsh, a sometimes cool, too many times emotional cyber cop, whose initial scene shows her competent in her job. Yet her antagonist proves almost invulnerable to her and the rest of the force. Most of the film is a cat and mouse (electronic this time) game during which the cops almost get him, but not quite. The denouement is a disappointment after the first third's emphasis on the electronic drama; it all devolves into some primitive communication, standard intuition, visual observation, and plain old luck. Marsh's continually emotional response is neither favorable to the women's movement nor objective police work. Or maybe I've just been preconditioned by TV's cool CSI-like investigators. Director Gregory Hoblit's pacing is much better than his direction of Ms. Lane; Anastos Michos's cinematography is spot on for a dreary, menacing Portland. In the absence of Silence of the Lambs and the presence of so much junk at this time of year, Untraceable has the only trace of a \"B\" movie thriller for a while. And don't forget the fava beans.",
         "First of all, even with a scant few trivial character actions that were a tad bit questionable, this film is absolutely - EXCELLENT! How can I say that? Well my wife and I usually get through our bag of popcorn within the first quarter of a film. This time, however, when the film ended we had almost a half bag left - uneaten. No, it wasn't disgust from anything depicted in the film, it was simply that the film grabbed our attention and virtually never let go. Now, who am I? Well, I am a scientist and my wife is a British midwife. Yes, we are computer competent and that may be a key element. We are also in our sixties - that may also be another key element. However, it is my opinion that most of the reviews written here (with the bare exception of the first one), were written by a generation that doesn't really know what terror is. They have been raised by so much simulated on screen violence and fake blood, that virtually nothing scares them anymore. However again, as a technical consultant, I have traveled to over 30 countries and worked in some brutal and godforsaken areas and witnessed incredible brutality. Trust me people, there are very scary things and situation in the real world and this film reveals, quite brilliantly, the rapid evolution of one of them within our own society. For those of you who were not a \"bit\" frightened, what the hell film did you view?"
