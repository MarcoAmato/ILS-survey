Arriving late to one birthday, his timing is off, the bratty kids a nightmare and a prank goes horribly wrong - he falls on a kitchen knife and goes to that Big Top in the sky. Years later the same nasty kids attend another more grown up bash. Little do they know, thanks to a black magic clown cult, Stitches will be the uninvited guest of honour seeking revenge on those responsible for his untimely death. Laughs and gore combine in this twisted tale which also sees some fantastic performances from its young and upcoming cast that includes; TOMMY KNIGHT (Doctor Who) and GEMMA-LEAH DEVEREUX (The Tudors).",

         "I went to the cinema to see 'Sinister', but it was full, so we went and saw Stitches instead. I'm so glad we did! This film was classic! I expected a horror, but I wasn't at all prepared for how much it'd make me smile. Ross does a brilliant job bringing his character to life, and the story and kids wrapped around the concept are just tacky enough to reek of stereotype, but just different enough to keep you entertained and smiling (such as Bulger doing the splits at the gym, or the 'bully' actually being the only character in a stable, functional relationship). Brilliant film, a lovely surprise to what would have otherwise been a disappointing evening!",
         "I love Ross Noble! So we jumped at the chance to see this as the closing film to Grimmfest this year! Im very glad i did! Stitches is a very funny take on the slasher genre, using comedy and horror combined, it reminded me of the latter Elm Street movies, where the villain has to use a comic gag to kill his victim! Ross noble seemed to revel in the role and proving to be a very convincing killer clown! He even went onto say in the Q & A about wanting sequels made, do we have a British Jason/Freddy in our midst! Maybe with a bit more budget and a stronger supporting cast and a little better writing, Stitches could become the UKs' very own slasher icon!",
         "I just finished watching this and I must admit that I had MANY truly laugh out loud moments. ONLY the UK people can pull off something like this with the DEAD-pan sense of humour it takes to make this work. Sure, some of the comments the clown makes are pretty corny, but there are far more that are REALLY funny! There are some nice classic Horror touches too. YES, it is a bit gore heavy; but, the effects are well done and very imaginative. I really appreciated the inclusion of the 'Cat' (YES, I love animals, but I love people too, so if you're gonna make a dang Horror film where a bunch of 'teens' are killed, well...) Anyway, back to the nice Horror touches... Gore withstanding (it's almost NEVER my favourite part anyway) the early scenes with the very creative Clown ceremony and mythology were quite entertaining. The guy playing the clown himself was bloody HILARIOUS! His deadpan comments, especially early on before the 'accident' were great! So, if you DO like entertaining and well done Comedy / Horror, then this is your film. As mentioned by another reviewer, if you are really sensitive about gore effects, then you might want to proceed carefully (For me personally, this kind of 'cartoon' or 'fantasy' gore is all right, although it IS kind of pushing it. What I absolutely do NOT like at all are these 'Torture Porn' films where evil people are just doing horrible, cruel, and mean-spirited things to other people in ULTRA- realistic ways without any fanciful or supernatural context - Those are complete non-starters with me...) I'd say that if you really liked 'REANIMATOR', you probably would really like this film. Lots of fun if this is your kind of thing...",
         "I am sure die hard fans of the horror genre will balk at the effects in this little gem of a comedy but then most die hard horror fans have a pole up their backsides the size of Nelsons Column judging by some of the reviews here at IMDb of other movies... This is a delightful comedy romp that pokes fun of the horror genre much in the same vein as \"Funny Man\", even the effects are a parody of horror effects that underlies the difficulties in producing them... Characterisation is simplistic and yet effective for a comedy (Nobody is expecting the type of characterisation of Anna Karenina in a simple comedy)... I personally feel that Ross Noble did a good job in playing the slobby and vengeful clown and many of the gags made me laugh out loud, not least the site of him riding a kiddies tricycle... If you want deep go and watch Anna Karenina or read war and peace but for a comedy this rings all the bells....",
         "-Minor Spoilers- The film starts off campy with the clown \"Stitches\" going to the birthday party of 10 year old Tom. The kids at the party are bullies to the clown and a simple prank from the kids ends with the gory death of \"Stitches\". 6 years later Tom and the group of friends get back together for Toms 16 year old birthday party. Little do they know that \"Stitches\" has risen from the grave to get revenge. I randomly stumbled across this gem one day at Best Buy and impulsively purchased it. I had no idea what I was in for but I didn't have high expectations. Little did I know this was one of the best modern indie horror movies! Many are going to disagree strongly, but I feel this movie is in the league of cult horror classics such as \"Evil Dead\" , \"Brain Dead/Dead Alive\" , and slasher movies of the 1980s. The budget for this movie is low, and they still managed to make a horror movie better than most big budget movies released nationwide in the US. Though this movie isn't really a 10/10. I gave it a 10 to help raise it's low score. It's more of a 9 in Horror standards. But it is a 10 when it comes to low budget movies! The special effects are so indie and realistic at the same time. The jokes and humor of the movie made me laugh multiple times. The music is creepy and the soundtrack is awesome. There is even a popular song from the 1980s used perfectly in a certain scene that is just fantastic! The gore effects were perfect and cleverly done. The acting was very believable. Honestly during the opening scene I thought I was going to hate this movie. Then things got serious, while still maintaining the humor. Ross Noble, the British Comedian, plays \"Stitches\" the evil clown. His performance is what makes this movie work the most. I cannot get over how perfect and eerie his portrayal of the living dead clown was. It was iconic. It is in the league of Robert Englund as Freddy Krueger and Doug Bradley as Pinhead. I will even go as far as to say that it was the best clown performance since Stephen Kings \"It\". This movie will make you laugh and cringe. It will creep you out. The visuals are gorgeous for a film with this low of a budget. They need to make more horror movies like this. This movie could be the start of a modern horror icon franchise! \"Stitches\" can be added to the list of iconic villains of Horror movies! I am disappointed at the low rating. Hopefully through the years if word-of-mouth helps, this movie will become the Horror cult classic that it is meant to become! Turn off the lights and watch this movie with friends or alone. You will have a good time. Well worth a purchase or redbox rental if you like good campy horror movies in the vain of \"Evil Dead\" and the original \"Nightmare on Elmstreet\" movies.",
         "I have to admit, I never had heard of the comedian Ross Noble before I watched this movie. And I wouldn't have been that intrigued by him, if I hadn't seen him perform live. Actually that means he opened the Frightfest and introduced Stitches a day later to the audience. The fact that he was talking about his movie made me believe he was the director. He got me fooled (met the real director too, a really nice guy) and maybe some others too. But back to this movie, that is a real fun little horror movie, that plays with the fear of clowns. Some have a real phobia, those shouldn't watch this movie of course. Or if you are easily offended (be it by violence or nonpolitical correctness) - don't watch. Everyone else: Jump on the the train and have fun during the trip.",
         "While the slasher/comedy/horror genre has been done to death, the Irish film 'Stitches' takes the main elements of the genre and puts a fresh twist on it. The story has a real 'Nightmare on Elm Street' vibe: Ross Noble plays Stitches, a cynical clown who is accidentally killed by some bratty kids at a birthday party. A clown cult preserves his spirit and six years later Stitches returns to exact revenge on the same kids, now teenagers. While 'Stitches' may be a lot more low-budget than modern horror fans are used to, it works because it's funny, it has imaginative and creative death scenes (another 'Elm Street' nod) and the over-the-top gore: including intestines being turned into a balloon animal, a head being blown up with a balloon pump, an umbrella through the eye and brains being scooped out with a can opener and an ice cream scoop. It's basically an old-school slasher film with a few updates. Noble is the only known actor in the film and he carries is: rather than lazily trade on his stand-up persona, he manages to balance the funny and creepy side of Stitches (even killing a poor, innocent cat during his rampage). He seems to be genuinely enjoying it, delivering his kills with bad clown puns. The teenage cast does a serviceable job but play second fiddle to Stitches' killing spree. If you're a fan of old-school slashers which balance the funny and the gory, then 'Stitches' is worth a look.",
         "If Peter Jackson had been from Ireland instead of New Zealand, Stitches is the movie he might have made first in place of Bad Taste. It's got the same dark humor, most of which falls flat but some of which hits the spot. There's the same gleeful gore, okay perhaps not quite as much as Bad Taste but close. The deaths are inventive and entertaining and the whole movie would have been improved by better editing, a better score and a bigger budget, just like Bad Taste. The plot is basic slasher fare. Two parts Friday 13th part VI, One Part Nightmare on Elm Street, One part Stephen King's IT, but a dash of it's own originality thrown in as well. It's let down a little by some really odd pacing and editing choices that slow down the action where it should be building up. If you've seen enough low budget indies you'll probably know what I'm talking about, it's a fairly common amateur film problem. Still, it's a damn good try and it's heart is in the right place. Regular folks will sit through this very bemused, or more likely turn it off after the first half hour, but horror aficionados will be at least entertained if not downright elated.",
         "Have seen the trailer and have seen so many positive things about this horror I was waiting for it's official release over here and let this day be the day that Stitches finally was available in the shops. Was it all worth the wait because face it, it was hyped somehow. Yes, for me it was worth the wait. I had a few good laughs and I enjoyed the killings, even as they were somehow funny it worked. Oh sure, if you think you are going to watch a scary movie or a slasher then you are wrong. This never came to me as a straight horror but it looked so British/Irish due the accents used and of course the one-liners said by Stitches (Ross Nobles). Oh yes, the clown do return out for revenge but when his nose was sniffing around for Stitches' victims it again was meant to be funny. The nose rolling around will be to much for some and could look ridiculous but it's a clown out for a kill so face it, this is how a clown it should do. On part of the horror the killings were mostly on the edge of gore. When ones intestines are taken out by Stitches it's a gory delight but immediately he's making figures with the intestines. How funny is that. I was in this movie from the beginning towards the end. I enjoyed it and you could spot that the director Conor McMahon knew his classic shot like the classic slasher POV shots. Stitches shows how funny situations and gore can be combined in one package even as it is done sometimes in CGI. Gore 2,5/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 4/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 1/5",
         "Killer clowns is something that we don't see that much off in the slasher genre, which is a shame as they can be quite scary or funny if handled right (It & Killer Clowns From Out Space) are the only ones that come to mind and now we have \"Stitches\" , a British Slasher flick mixed with comedy, which is somewhat rather tough to get right and doesn't always work, but with this movie I can gladly say that they got right. Stitches is the name of the clown himself, who starts off as a children's entertainer and is accidentally killed at 10 year old Tommy's birthday party and of course swears revenge on Tommy and his friends and then fast forward 6 years later, Tommy now an awkward teenager still haunted by the freak accident and fears that Stitches will one day come back and kill him, and in true fashion he does come back. The film moves along at a swift pace which is a good thing firstly when we are introduced to the kids now as teenagers we get the usual hijinks and some gross out humour and then the tone quickly changes and we are of course treated to a variety of creative and fun kills and the gore effects are really great, (that's where all the budget went) but it's money well spent we get exploding head, private parts ripped apart, brain's scouped out with ice cream scoop and a nasty umbrella accident. But there are some flaws, like the low low budget which shows throughout sadly, and at times this movie seems to switch from one extreme to another one minute a dark comedy and one minute a slasher flick and plus some parts do border beyond stupid, I could have done without the stupid clown nose part which was way too over the top, along with the mystical orgin of clowns part which was again stupid and pointless. But those flaws set aside \"Stitches\" was still a fun entertaining ride, the teen cast were disposable but likable although the dialogue could have done with some fine tuning. Ross Nobole as Stitches definitely stole the show displaying comedy and menace at level best. Tommy Knight is also decent enough as the main final boy. All in all \"Stitches\" is a fun way to pass the time, and could have been much better if there was more of a budget, and take out some of the stupid parts."
