         "DC animated movies almost never fail to please me and Batman: Assault on Arkham, directed by Jay Oliva and Ethan Spaulding, portrays criminals with a vicious and sexy attitude. With almost all the same voice actors from the Batman Arkham series including Kevin Conroy, Oliva and Spaulding take the Batman animated movies into Arkham Asylum just as portrayed in the Arkham video games series. In my opinion, it's about time Warner Brothers created a Batman animated movie based on the atmosphere of the Arkham games as it is so popular with the fans. Interestingly enough, this movie focuses more on a criminal special task force created by Amanda Waller, who also created the Suicide Squad, rather than Batman; however, there was still enough of Batman to satisfy our Dark Knight needs especially when the voice is Kevin Conroy. What surprised me the most was Troy Baker as the voice of the Joker. Though he has been the voice of Joker before, I almost thought it was Mark Hamill until I looked up the cast. With that in mind, Baker's acting inspires me with high hopes for the Jokers future. Overall, this Batman animated movie had a sexy, trilling, attitude which was packed full of lethal action that would please any Batman fan. A perfect 10!",
         "Batman is a real badass, the Joker is a total wacko, Harley Quinn is hot. What else do you need? No but seriously, Aussault on Arkham did many things right, the characters are fun (especially Boomerang who is the major comic relief in this movie, the Joker and of course Quinn), the action is pretty awesome and there were some very fine One-Liners also. What I liked the most was the very mature style of the movie, there is blood spilled, heads are blown of and teeth get punched in but nothing is never totally over the top (as many already said it's very surprising Assault on Arkham was rated PG-13 and not R). Altogether I liked: -gritty style -mature humor -well animated action/fight scenes -actuall plot surprises -real fight consequences (villains DIE, and don't flee with a black eye) -GREAT voice acting Now for the things I did not like: -not enough Joker (yes his role was pretty major but it was not quite enough screen time for my taste) -overall to short (71 mins? really?)",
         "Villains get the spotlight in BATMAN: ASSAULT ON ARKHAM, a loose prequel set before the critically acclaimed Batman: Arkham Asylum video game. A black ops mission to assassinate the Riddler is foiled by Batman, prompting CIA operative Amanda Waller to assemble \"Task Force X\", aka The Suicide Squad. Morally ambiguous Vigilante Black Spider, seductive ice queen Killer Frost, savage brute King Shark, Australian scoundrel Captain Boomerang, crazy Harley Quinn and the cynical assassin Deadshot. These sociopathic misfits have to put aside their differences to work together, lest they \"lose their heads\". Playing out like a good ol fashioned heist film in the vein of THE Italian JOB or OCEAN'S ELEVEN, we see six villains assembled by Amanda Waller and sent on a mission impossible deep into the heart of the dreaded Arkham Asylum to retrieve a thumb drive containing sensitive information, that was in the Riddler's possession. From the electronic heavy rock soundtrack to the Taratino-esque roll call opening credits sequence, you know you are in for a completely different animated movie. The fun begins when we get to see how well these bad guys play off one another in a script that is chock full of dark humour and depth. Although each villain does not get much development, we do get a \"keynotes\" look into their personalities, their motivations and their minds as the brisk pace of the movie sprints from action scene to action scene. Their roles in the team are familiar archetypes for classic villain teams: the alpha male leader (Deadshot), the butt monkey backstabber (Captain Boomerang), the dumb muscle (King Shark), the seductress (Killer Frost), the mysterious odd one out (Black Spider), and the psycho (Harley Quinn). Yet in this familiarity comes the opportunity for the characters to truly shine thanks to some magnificent chemistry and voice acting. Alas, for a title named \"Batman: Assault on Arkham\" the titular Batman plays a supporting, almost cameo, role. But when he does appear, he exhibits a powerful on screen presence. Those barely visible eyes staring intensely from within the cowl, the new look of the costume which blends the dark blue streamlined design of Justice League Unlimited with the armoured detailing of New 52, not to mention the return of the classic Batman voice Kevin Conroy. But I digress. Batman is not the focus here, the Suicide Squad is. And they get one hell of a 75 minute showcase. Throughout the movie, you get a sense that some of the team members have their own agenda and secrets. What looks like a crazy outburst turns out to be a well calculated distraction for example. This movie keeps you guessing and keeps the tension up from start to finish. Like previous DC Animated movies, ASSAULT ON ARKHAM does not shy away from bloody violence or semi-sexual depictions. The near nudity, the blood letting, it is insane, threading close to an \"R\" rating. Action is smooth, fluid, with a very high budget quality which combines detailed artwork with dynamic animation. Visually, Moi Animation studios have outdone themselves once again delivering top notch animation that surpasses many of their Japanese anime counterparts. For quick comparison, take a look at the animation on SON OF BATMAN done by Japanese anime studio \"TheAnswerStudio\" and then compare it to the visuals in BATMAN ASSAULT ON ARKHAM. No contest. BATMAN ASSAULT ON ARKHAM was a risky experiment, but an experiment that pays off. Edgy but fun, dark but not brooding, intense but not shallow. There seem to be things you can do on screen and a dark sense of fun you get with villains instead of heroes. Here I am hoping that DC would consider releasing a villain centric animated movie for every two hero centric movies per year. The DC rogues gallery needs to be tapped and tapped well. This is a good star",
         "It's weird that you'll ever find yourself rooting for the bad guys to win and \"Assault on Arkham\" makes you do this exactly. The film introduces you to an ensemble of villains, given an objective that depends on their lives. You find yourself quite absorbed in the plot and the characters as they interact with each other (not always harmoniously), almost wanting to see them succeed when going to the lengths that they do. If you're turning this film on expecting it to be a \"Batman\" film then you may be disappointed to know that he only appears for a few minutes at a time and that the central focus actually lies on the Suicide Squad, but, knowing this in advance allows you to enjoy and appreciate the film a lot more. Thankfully, I was informed of this beforehand and equally loved seeing either Batman or his adversaries on-screen, therefore making it all the more exciting to see them all appear at once at the same time. The animation and art style is great and superb voice acting by Kevin Conroy (Batman), Troy Baker (The Joker), Neal McDonough (Deadshot) and pretty much everyone else; they really bring the characters to life, especially Conroy who has been voicing the caped crusader for decades and practically knows the character inside out. My only issue with \"Batman: Assault on Arkham\" is that it is too short, especially when the film gets going in the final act and has a lot to potentially offer but doesn't really have the time or room to explore. This is a good animated film and definitely worth the watch if you're a Batman fan, especially if you're familiar with the \"Batman: Arkham\" video game series.",
         "Love this movie. Watch this if you are a fan of Batman and his villains. Even if you don't play the Arkham games (why wouldn't you?) and just like the shows and comics, this is still a must watch. This film took a more mature route which I absolutely love. There's cursing, innocent people die, main characters die, tasteful sex scene, etc. Batman is a secondary focus in this movie after the suicide squad, which worried me at first but then I loved it. At some points, you even start rooting for some of the bad guys. Showed an interesting perspective from the villains side, always worried about Batman popping up and ruining everything. The animation was fantastic, the character designs were awesome, the dialogue was great. Would recommend to anyone who's a Batman fan.",
         "Quite possibly the best DC film to date. Top notch character development, particularly for underused characters. Top notch writing, something sorely lacking in Hollywood in general. Top notch animation with so many brilliant subtleties. Top notch directing...no wasted scenes. Before watching this, if you are a true fan, seriously go through every episode of Justice League Unlimited, Batman Beyond, and Young Justice. The characters are so rich and vivid given that context. If this is your first DC film, well, I hope you appreciate how truly brilliant these characters have been cast in this particular film.",
         "I saw the SDCC exclusive trailer for Suicide Squad very recently and it got me so hyped up to see what the DC cinematic universe had in store for us. At first the DCU looked like it was trying to be what Marvel had set up but looking at the two latest trailers it looks like they really do have some spectacular surprises in store! Anyway, after seeing the trailer i wanted to see a lot more of the Suicide Squad in action. I was lucky enough to find Batman Assault on Arkham and well.. as if i wasn't already excited enough for Suicide Squad! First things first, this film may have the Batman name in the title, but this really isn't a Batman he is merely a co-star. This film very much belongs to the squad themselves. Amanda Waller needs to get a thumb drive from the Riddler's cane so in order to do so she recruits the baddest criminals she can find from the very walls of Arkham Asylum to get it out. Meanwhile Batman is attempting to find a dirty bomb left behind by the Joker who is still trapped in his own cell, which he of course links to Harley Quinn. We get to see characters we will soon be introduced to in the film including Harley, Captain Boomerang and Deadshot who serves as the protagonist. Among these 'big names' we also encounter lesser-known villains like King Shark and Killer Frost who form an unexpected bond and Black Spider (voiced by Giancarlo Esposito from Breaking Bad). All ending with a climatic battle between Task force X, the Joker and Batman himself. The film claims to be based off of the Batman Arkham series of games. The voice of Batman is as always played to perfection by veteran Batman actor Kevin Conroy. Every time Conroy lends his voice to the character, even only for a small role like this film, you really feel like you are listening to the only actor fit for voicing him. Troy Baker mirrors Mark Hamill like he did in Arkham Origins and steals the show. He may not be as threatening and villainous as Hamill is but he comes a close second. I also loved Hynden Walch as Harley Quinn and I will go as far as to say that Harley was my favourite character in this film. She takes on the role and manages to be both ditzy and villainous, which is all a fan really wants from such an iconic character. Each member of Task Force X gets their own chance to shine in a different way and i was on board with each character so well that I was rooting for them more than i was for Batman by the end of it. DC can be hit and miss with their animated features, and this is in the ranks as being one of the best they have developed so far. I hope that the adaption of 'The Killing Joke' that is in the works can be as great as this one manages to be. It is also the right element of dark. The violence was not watered down for this one and we get our fair share of head explosions. I am hoping the movie is not watered down and manages an 'R' rating because it has the potential to be something very special. This film raises the hype metre even higher and i am hoping for something great that could even trump The Dark Knight in terms of darkness and pure character development. The DC Universe will be kicked off with a 'BANG!' (Pun intended) and i hope more animated DC adaptions take a leaf out of its book.",
         "The world of the \"Batman: Arkham\" video game is brought to vivid animated life with DC and Warner Bros. Home Entertainment's \"Batman: Assault on Arkham.\" The Dark Knight takes a backseat to the bad guys in what is the comic book equivalent of a heist or search and rescue flick much like \"Red,\" \"Ocean's 11,\" \"Escape from New York,\" and others. The movie takes place after the events in \"Batman: Arkham Origins.\" It's an exciting and humorous romp that will thrill fans of the game franchise and \"mature\" enthusiasts of super heroes. Amanda Waller puts together a team of super villains to infiltrate Arkham Asylum and complete an unfinished job. She wants the Riddler assassinated for secret knowledge he possesses. Black Spider, Captain Boomerang, Deadshot, Harley Quinn, Killer Frost, KGBeast, and King Shark are all forced to comply to her wishes thanks to an explosive planted in their necks which Waller can detonate if they won't fulfill her demands. One thing DC animated movie buffs will be happy about is the return of Kevin Conroy in the role of Batman. The rest of the voice cast is fine, but they're overshadowed every time the Dark Knight appears on screen. Troy Baker does his best Mark Hamill impersonation as the Joker. I really thought it was Hamill until the credits rolled at the end. A word of caution to parents out there with children who love super heroes. \"Batman: Assault on Arkham\" isn't kid-friendly in any form or fashion. It's rated PG-13 for violence, sexual content, and language. We're not talking your typical comic book violence, either. Several heads are blown off for example. Harley Quinn shows quite a bit of skin and there's a scene of Deadshot and her tumbling around in bed together. The language is on par with what you would get in any action movie released today starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, Liam Neeson, or Sylvester Stallone. However, the \"F\" word is never dropped. \"Batman: Assault on Arkham\" will thrill fans of the video game franchise it's based on. People unfamiliar with the \"Arkham Asylum,\" \"Arkham City,\" and \"Arkham Origins\" universe need not worry. I don't play the games and had no problem jumping right in.",
         "More fun than a barrel of hammers. Pretty much everything you could hope for from a frothy little DC adventure, nice graphics, nice story, sharp dialogue (lots of inside jokes) and great voice actors. Brilliant \"ensemble\" story, the kind where after a while you feel you can associate personalities with characters. The ultimate irony, the only part that falls flat, is that this is a Batman movie where Batman himself is somehow redundant. You get so involved with the \"team\" that when Batsy shows up, he is almost an irritant. Which in turn makes you wonder if this was packaged as a Batman movie merely to milk the goodwill in the name...?",
         "In Batman: Assault on Arkham, which is set after Arkham Origins but before Arkham Asylum, Amanda Waller assembles the Suicide Squad, comprising of Deadshot, Harley Quinn, Captain Boomerang, Black Spider, King Shark, Killer Frost and KGBeast. They are tasked with retrieving the Riddler's staff from Arkham Asylum, which is said to contain sensitive information that Waller wants, all while trying to prevent the Joker from detonating a series of bombs that will decimate Gotham City - and of course holding off Batman himself. The plot of Batman: Assault on Arkham is easily one of the film's strong points. It tells a character-driven story and devotes time to building relationships between characters, particularly between Harley Quinn and Deadshot, which helps make the characters more believable and the viewer much more invested. The film plays out quite like Guardians of the Galaxy in that a team of ragtag misfits must learn to work together to defeat a common goal, which I really liked. It has the guts to introduce characters that aren't as well known in the DC Universe such as King Shark and Black Spider, and it was very refreshing to see new characters on-screen. However, the end of the film is much too bloated with action scene after action scene, which is disappointing when considering the amount of time that had gone into developing the characters prior to this, undermining the efforts put in by the mostly solid script, which is good aside from a few jokes that don't quite hit the mark. It makes the film very unbalanced and is definitely my least favourite part of the 1 hour and 15 minute spectacle. However, there are plenty of Easter eggs and references made to the Arkham-verse that keep this film very interesting and at times captivating to watch, although I won't spoil them here. The characters are, on the whole, just as good as the plot, aside from a few that don't fit in. Particular standouts are Harley Quinn, played here by Tara Strong, who is just as good as in the Arkham games, portraying the insanity yet innocence of her character fantastically. Other highlights were Troy Baker as the Joker, who was splendidly psychotic and almost as good as Mark Hamill, and Batman himself, played by the legendary Kevin Conroy. These characters are true to their comic roots and remain consistent with the Arkham games, helping this film slot perfectly into the mythos. However, the film is let down by Captain Boomerang in particular, here played by Greg Ellis. Boomerang is supposed to be Australian, and Ellis - who hails from England - just can't pull the Australian accent off, and it really isn't helped by the script, which tries to pack in as many Australia-related puns as it can, making this character stick out like a sore thumb. From a technical standpoint, the film is simply incredible. The music is fantastic, mixing a blend of techno during the action scenes and splendid opening credits to rock at other times, and it gives this film the unique feel that Guardians also had. Action scenes are handled fantastically by directors Jay Olivia and Ethan Spaulding, with the camera always managing to keep up with the action and let the viewer see the best parts, in what is a much more brutal film than other DC animated entries. The film is also generally well edited, with some of the transitions between scenes fantastic, and the tight editing during the action scenes allowing their intensity to remain even after cuts. However, every now and then a scene goes on for far too long, perhaps focusing on a character for a number of seconds after they had finished talking, which left these moments feeling awkward and particularly jarring. Batman: Assault on Arkham manages to maintain the legacy of the Arkham series thanks to well-developed characters, captivating action scenes and a fantastic soundtrack, although is let down by a bloated third act and a few characters that don't quite fit in. However, it is brilliant tale nonetheless that I highly recommend."
