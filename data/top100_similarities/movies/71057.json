      "synopsis": "The movie opens with the Scientist ( Alan Oppenheimer) making a sentient ragdoll on whose back he writes '9'. Outside, the world lies in ruins; the result of a catastrophic war caused by mankind's dependence on machines. Some time later, when all is silent, the ragdoll 9 comes to life. Looking around, he sees that the room he is in, 'The First Room', is a complete mess and devoid of life. He opens a window and sees the entire city before him in ruins, the sky dark and cast over. He tries to say something but nothing happens. He can't speak. With little trepidation, he walks through the desolate and deserted city. He comes upon a car in the road and, looking inside, sees a mother and her child lying dead within. As he recoils from the sight, he hears a sound and sees a slowly approaching light. 9 hides behind some rubble, picks up a metal bar, and waits. As the light comes closer, 9 swings the bar and it connects with a creature that closely resembles him. But the other ragdoll appears older and is differently crafted, wearing a magnifying glass in front of his eyes and fitted with a lit candle on his headgear. The ragdoll, 2 ( Martin Landau), gasps at the sight of 9, who starts to run away until 2 cries out, \"Wait! I'm a friend!\" 9 stops and returns to help 2 from the ground, who then gives 9 an appraising look and marvels at his detail and design. When he sees that 9 can't talk, 2 instructs him to follow. They walk over to a discarded doll at the side of the road and 2 begins to fumble inside it. In the meantime, 9 picks up a bullet from the ground and begins playing with it, unaware of what it is. 2 manages to find the doll's voicebox and stops 9 before he can cause damage with the bullet, telling him that some things are better left alone. 2 then inserts the voicebox into 9's chest cavity through his zipper. After some adjustments, 9 ( Elijah Wood) finally speaks and says, \"Friend\". 2 then notices something inside 9 and pulls it out. The small, hemispherical device with three symbols on it is revealed to be 'The Talisman'. 2 says to himself, \"He's always drawing this\". A loud sound echoes nearby and 2 suddenly becomes afraid. He instructs 9 to hide inside a nearby broken can while he stands guard, armed with a spear, waiting tensely. A large 'Beast' appears and attacks 2. When it notices the Talisman, the Beast snatches it and turns its attention to 9. With its claws inches from 9's face, 2 tries to distract the Beast. The Beast turns and swallows 2, allowing 9 to find another hiding spot and evade capture. Unable to find 9, the Beast departs. Slightly damaged, his arm torn, and shaken from the attack, 9 faints. His unconscious form is soon spotted by a one-eyed ragdoll named '5' ( John C. Reilly). When 9 awakens, he sees that 5 is tending to him and that his arm has been fixed. Within their hideout, 5 tells him that 2 is usually better at fixing them, unaware of 2's fate. At that moment, an elderly and domineering ragdoll called 1 ( Christopher Plummer) enters. He looks at 9 and angrily berates 5 for almost leading the Beast to them. A larger ragdoll named 8 ( Fred Tatasciore) enters and appears to be 1's bodyguard. 1 orders them to all go to the upper level of the building, which they travel to in a pulley-drawn bucket. Once there, 9 discovers that they're inside a half-destroyed church: Notre Dame. The remnants of a fighter plane lays within part of the church. 1 narrates the 'story' as he knows it. When he first awoke, he saw that there was a war between man and machine. As the ragdolls ran for their lives, 5 lost his left eye and was saved by 2. While they remained hidden, the machines proved victorious over man and deployed poisonous gas bombs that killed off all life on Earth. All that remained was the ruins, the ragdolls, and the Beasts. 1 tells 9 that all the ragdolls that were created, 3, 4, 7, and now 2, have been lost except for them. He orders 5 and 9 to go to the watchtower while, in another room, 6 ( Crispin Glover) repeatedly draws the image of the Talisman on paper with his pen-like fingers, appearing to be the one 2 was referring to. On the watchtower, 5 and 9 look through a telescope and see a large factory in the distance. 5 tells 9 that the factory is where the Beast would have taken 2, but is reluctant to rescue him despite 9's insistence. When 9 argues that 2 would have tried to save them, 5 relents and procures a map that they can use to get there. As they walk, they discover 2's candle headpiece and 5 wonders why he was out there all alone. They search for a tunnel that will lead to their destination as a sandstorm rolls in and blows the map away. 5 and 9 continue, knowing they can't go back now. When the sandstorm dies down, they notice a large footprint on the ground that they recognize as the Beast's. Needing light, they take a small lightbulb from the headlight of a wrecked car and 9 fashions a torch-staff with it. 5 sadly notes that clever 2 was just as likely to have thought of something like that. In the distance, the shadow of a creature with a beak finds 5's map. 5 and 9 finally arrive at the factory and find that it's a dark and imposing place. 9 turns off his light to prevent unwanted attention as they go inside. Eventually, they see a cage and discover 2 inside it. At first he is unresponsive, but slowly wakes and is happy that they've come for him. When they hear sounds nearby, 9 takes a look and sees the Beast trying to insert the Talisman into a socket of some kind. Suddenly, the Beast sees 9 and lunges to attack. At that moment, the beaked creature appears and beheads the Beast. When it removes its beaked headdress, the creature is revealed to be another ragdoll named 7 ( Jennifer Connelly). 2 and 5 are ecstatic to see her, having given her up for dead, and introduce her to 9. In the midst of their happy reunion, 9 picks up the Talisman and unwittingly inserts it into the socket. 2 notices too late and tries to stop 9, but the factory comes alive. A bright light shoots out of the central machine and strikes 2 in the eyes and mouth and drains his life force. His lifeless body falls to the ground in a heap. With no time to mourn 2, 5, 7, and 9 run from the awakened Machine, a large spherical creature with a bright red light at its core and limb-like electrodes protruding from it. The ragdolls' escape is blocked by a chasm but 7 notices a lever overhead and uses 5's grappling gun to shoot a hook around the switch. 7 and 9 grab 5 and swing towards a conveyor belt on the other side. However, their collective weight throws the switch and the resulting jerk causes 7 to lose her grip. 5 and 9 fall onto the conveyor belt while 7 manages to grab a ledge. Activated by the switch, the conveyor belt starts to move and 5 and 9 are forced to dodge many large metallic objects. They fall to the floor below as the Machine moves menacingly towards 7, sparking its electrodes. 5 and 9 distract it with their torch-staff and the Machine gives chase. 5 and 9 are able to hide from view for a few moments and reunite with 7 in the tunnel. The Machine chases them inside but proves too large to fit in the tunnel. The ragdolls escape. Outside the factory, 5 is devastated by 2's death, and 7 is furious at 9 for causing the chaos. However, she knows where to find answers and tells them to follow her. Meanwhile, the Machine uses materials around it to create a new monster. 5, 7, and 9 go to a library with a large courtyard filled with statues. The ragdolls look at old paintings on the walls and see books scattered all over the place. 7 calls, and small, twin ragdolls with hoods appear: 3 and 4. Despite being mute, their eyes project video memories. As they look over 9, their eyes flash and analyze him with curiosity. 7 asks them for help, saying that they've awakened something terrible. 9 guiltily corrects her, saying that 'he' woke the creature and the twins project a video on a book describing 'The Machine'. As it turns out, the Machine was created by the very same Scientist who created them. Under orders from a dictatorial Chancellor ( Tom Kane), the Scientist commissioned the Machine and dubbed it the 'Brain'; a device that has the ability to create its own machines. The Chancellor used it to turn the tide of his war but it soon turned against mankind and destroyed the world. For some reason, it fell inactive afterwards, only to be reawakened by 9. Eager to know more about the Talisman that woke the Brain, 9 draws the three shapes that were inscribed on it. 5 says that 6 draws those very shapes and 9 requests to see him. 7, however, refuses to return to the church, explaining that she doesn't like 1 very much before running off. Unabashed, 5 and 9 return to the church to see 6 but are grabbed by 8. 1 enters the room, furious, and accuses them of dooming them all. 9 asks him who sent 2 out into the world alone and 1 doesn't deny it. 6 enters and sees the shapes drawn by 9. He says that the shapes are the 'Source' but, before 9 can ask more, 1 orders them all locked up. 9 calls 1 a coward but 1 angrily retorts that he'll do what it takes to keep them safe. At that moment, the church is attacked by the Brain's newly created Beast, a creature that resembles a pterodactyl, with wings and a long beak. The ragdolls flee for their lives as the Beast's attack lights the church on fire, and they wind up on one of the wings of the crashed fighter plane. Cornered, 7 enters and tries to attack the Beast from behind but it turns and swats her away. She tries again but the Beast shoots a cabled harpoon into her leg and begins to reel her in. 9 grabs her and uses her spear to stab the Beast's wing, halting their movement. 8 arrives and cuts the taut cable which slingshots away and wraps around the fighter plane's wing propeller, causing the wing to start sliding downwards. 8 grabs a groove in the wing while 7 and 9 hold on, but 1 loses his balance and his staff. 9 grabs the staff and holds it out to 1 who grabs it. 5 and 6 land inside the propeller mechanism and turn the propeller on. The spinning propeller pulls the Beast towards it but, with a burst of strength and speed, the Beast leaps away and lands inches from 1, taking his cape in its beak. 9 yells at 1 to remove his cape. Reluctantly, 1 listens and releases it, sending the Beast snapping backwards and into the propeller where it's torn apart and destroyed. Thanks to the fire, however, the ragdolls are now homeless and they leave the church as it burns. 1 watches sadly as their 'sanctuary' smolders. They all go to the library to live with 3 and 4. Meanwhile, a drone takes the remnants of the Beast back to the Brain. It becomes angry until it focuses on 2's body and appears to hatch an idea. At the library, 8 is appointed as the lookout. It's quiet outside so he takes the opportunity to use a magnet on his head to get some sort of high. While 3, 4, 6, and 9 go over the symbol drawings, 1 becomes upset about what he terms \"dark science\". 9 accuses him of sending 2 out to scout purposely to kill him off. Indignant, 1 says that 2 was sacrificed because he was old and weak. Furious, 7 jumps on him and puts a knife to his throat. 9 talks her down and she walks off angrily. 1 leaves as well. Short on answers, 9 decides to go to the First Room where he was created. Outside, 8 hears something and looks around. He walks tensely through the courtyard and suddenly sees 2 rise up in the air, his eyes flashing like a strobe light. 8 becomes hypnotized. In a separate room, 1 walks alone in a huff before he becomes startled by a sound. His fear increases when he sees 2 floating eerily towards him. Like 8, 1 becomes hypnotized by 2's flashing eyes. It's revealed that 2's body is actually being used as a puppet by a snakelike Beast, the head of which opens up to reveal a one-eyed skull. The serpentine body, covered in fabric with jointed legs attached to it, picks 1 up and begins to tie him in thread. Already stuffed inside the Snake, 8 lies still. As 1 is reeled in, 5 and 9 rush out to his rescue. The Snake uses 2 again in an attempt to hypnotize them as well but 9 averts his eyes. 5, however, becomes entranced and is rooted to the spot. Just then, 7's spear hits 2 and embeds him in a wall nearby, stopping the hypnotic flashing. 7 runs towards 2's body, dodging the Snake's attacks and retrieves her spear before cutting the Snake's tail from 2's form. The Snake grabs hold of her and 5 suddenly snaps out of his trance. He shoots the Snake in its one eye, causing it to retreat and slither away with 7 and 8. 7 screams out to 9 but the Snake escapes. 1 is safe but 9 tells him that the Snake has taken 7 and 8. 9 proposes that they rescue them but 1 refuses. Still, 9 manages to persuade him. They perform funerary rites for 2 and fit him on a raft with coins over his eyes, letting him float freely into the sewers before they head off towards the factory. With his torch-staff, 9 goes inside alone. He tells 5 that if he doesn't return, 5 is to destroy the factory. Inside, 9 watches as the Snake hands 8 over to the Brain. 8's life force is drained into the Brain, making it more powerful. As the Snake reaches for 7, 9 ties a threat around a bolt and tosses it over a ledge between a pair of moving cogs. He is able to distract the Snake which places 7 back inside itself as it goes after 9. Through its one broken eye, it lunges at what it thinks is a ragdoll and begins tying it up. The 'doll' is actually a piece of burlap fabric wrapped around the torch-staff. When the Snake inadvertently turns the light on the staff on, it recoils from the light. 9 then burst out of his hiding place and runs with a knife in his mouth. Finally seeing him, the Snake gives chase. The dummy ragdoll, tied to the cabled bolt, is pulled along by the Snake until the cable is caught in the moving cogs, yanking the Snake back. At that, 9 turns around and runs up to the Snake, pulled upward by the cable. 9 uses his knife to slash open the Snake's fabric body, freeing 7. The Snake is pulled up and into the cogs where its head is crushed. Outside, 1 and 5 prepare to push a barrel full of fuel inside the tunnel. 1 is all for getting it done immediately, but 5 wants to wait for 7 and 9. They are then noticed by a recon drone. Using 5's grappling gun, they rope it and start to pull it down. Inside, 7 and 9 are spotted by the Brain which sends mechanical spiders after them. 7 and 9 sprint into the tunnel and yell for the ragdolls outside to send in the barrel. 1 and 5 light the fuse and push the barrel into the tunnel. It is immediately followed by the drone which they have tied to the barrel. As the barrel and drone roll down the tunnel, 7 and 9 dodge it before escaping just in time; the barrel knocks back all of the mechanical spiders and falls into the factory where the Brain can only watch helplessly before it explodes. The factory erupts in flames as the ragdolls escape. The ecstatic ragdolls start to celebrate and 3 and 4 put on a record player, though 1 feels a bit downcast. As 5 chases a runaway LP record he notices, to his horror, that the Brain is still alive. Mobile, it chases him up the hill. 9 tries to run to 5's rescue but 1 suddenly restrains him. The Brain grabs 5 and drains his life force, regaining its strength. The ragdolls run towards a rickety bridge with the Brain in close pursuit. 6 then notices that the ragdolls absorbed by the Brain have actually had their souls trapped inside of it. While they are able to run easily across the bridge, the Brain proves too heavy and the bridge gives way under it. As it tries to pull itself up, 6 tells the other ragdolls not to destroy it or else their friends will be trapped inside it forever. The Brain loses its grip and falls but manages to grasp 6 and pulls him down with it. 6 cries out for the others to go to the First Room for the Source before the Brain drains his soul. Safe for the moment, 9 tells the others that he wants to abide by 6's wishes and go to the First Room, but the others are more intent on destroying the Brain once and for all. 9 decides to run to the First Room alone, where he finds schematics for the Brain and for the ragdolls themselves. He discoveres a holographic projector marked '9' and turns it on. An image of the Scientist appears and the man tells 9 about the Brain, a creation made up primarily of his own intelligence. He then tells 9 that he and the other ragdolls are vessels containing pieces of the Scientist's very soul, each representing a part of his personality. 9 was his last creation before he finally died. He shows 9 the Talisman and the sequence needed to turn the Brain off permanently. With this knowledge, 9 returns to the others who are busy hurling bombs at the rapidly advancing Brain. 9 tells them that the Scientist is the Source but 1 continues to throw bombs. As the Brain gets closer, the dolls run and watch as the Brain becomes stuck in barbed wire, giving them time to hide in a tunnel. 9 informs the others that they have to remove the Talisman from the Brain, which suddenly sets fire to a box of bullets in the tunnel, causing a huge explosion. The ragdolls fall scattered, bruised but alive. 1, however, has lost a few fingers. 9 bravely faces the Brain and, just before he is drained, is pushed aside by 1 who is sacrificed and drained instead, having been inspired to bravery by 9. 9 then grabs the Talisman from the Brain and hits the sequence shown to him by the Scientist, aiming the Talisman back at the Brain. The Brain screams as the souls are transferred into the Talisman and the machine, soulless, explodes. 3, 4, and 7 emerge and find 9 slumped to the ground, but alive. 7 tells him that he did it, but 9 responds, \"Not yet.\" The ragdolls light a fire and set 5 positions around it for their fallen friends, each with their respective numbers. 9 hits the sequence on the Talisman and, one by one, the souls of the fallen ragdolls are released, glowing green in the night. 8 is the first out. He smiles at them, followed by 6, 2 and 5, and then by 1. 1 approaches 9 and puts his hand on his shoulder before turning and walking over to his marker on the ground. The spirits then begin to rise together, except for 5 who gives 9 a questioning glance before smiling at 9's assuring nod. He joins the others as they float towards the heavens becoming 5 columns of swirling light in the purple-colored sky. 7 takes 9's hand and tells him that their friends are finally free. The green lights coalesce, penetrating the cloud cover, and disappear in a miniature explosion. It then begins to rain for the first time in ages; a healing start to the rebirth of the planet. 3, 4, 7, and 9 look up together as the rain falls on them and 7 asks 9 what will happen next. 9 answers that he's not sure but that the world is theirs now; it's what they make of it. As the rain falls, a closeup reveals tiny microorganisms thriving in the water, indicating that life will start again to flourish in the world again ... someday ...",

         "9 is better than average... but only barely. The movie is carried by a unique visual style and a great sense of \"place.\" The sack-men (and woman) are refreshingly odd and fun to watch. The post-apocalyptic city is consistently beautiful and dangerous. Desolate without feeling dull. Unfortunately, the story and characters ARE dull. Not crushingly so... but enough to frustrate. Frequent, obvious plot holes and violations of established world-rules pulled me out of the movie over and over again. Tired clichés abound. I wasn't able to shake the feeling that I'd seen and heard this all before. And that's a shame because there's a lot of potential here. If only the writer had taken more chances. Why not challenge the audience and defy expectations? Why make a movie that's too scary for kids but too simplistic for adults? Who is expected to enjoy it? I would watch another Shane Acker movie if one is made (hopefully after he's picked a target audience). But 9 is not a classic. ... that said, it's probably worth watching on the big screen just for the sights and sounds.",
         "I come from the school of early Tim Burton, and Jim Henson- two of my cinema deities from my earliest memories- and this is the first time in a long time that anyone has managed to touch on that magic for me. I'll do my best to convey what a fantastic movie this is, without really revealing too much of the plot- because I think that this movie is best experienced not really knowing anything. You come in the same way the main character does- not knowing anything of this world. While sitting in the theater, I recalled memories of the intensity and heart of \"my first movies\" such as E.T., The Secret of Nymh, The Dark Crystal, and Edward Scissorhands- movies that touched upon something that was at once so rooted in human emotion yet so fantastic and unimaginable. I can absolutely say that \"9\" is now considered one in that catalog of visionary and hallowed movies. Guaranteed some will have a complaint with the length (a seemingly short 79 minutes considering the scale and impact of the story) but I think that a movie can be an epic without needing to be over 2 hours long, or a HUGE amount of unnecessary back story and origins that's only purpose is to make the story SEEM grandiose. This movie is a complete work of art- from the obviously eye-catching visual style and composition of what you see, down to the basic story and character development that you feel. In 79 minutes this team managed to harness my imagination and senses without having to dumb-it-down for the audience, or use any of the old gags that many bigger studios seem to rely on to sell tickets (thankfully there are NO cheesy gross out jokes to appeal to a typical cable-fed attention span). Instead they took me to places that I had never thought of, but will never forget. My most respectful nod to everyone involved. Absolutely do not miss this one.",
         "I was looking forward to seeing 9, as I had already seen the original short film (also called 9) and wanted to see what they could do by expanding upon the story. Well, after seeing this full-length film, I can certainly say I liked the computer generated animation....as for the story, well, it left a bit to be desired. And the problem is that I can't strongly recommend the film, but if you don't see it in the theater, then you'll probably like the film less because the graphics are THE film. The story is set in an alternate reality. While some of the features look very much like Earth, many of the details are different. There's been a war raging and tanks are definitely of the WWI variety while airplanes are of the WWII style--yet there are also very modern holograms as well. As for the leader, there is some similarity to a fascist dictatorship, but this guy sure ain't Hitler, Mussolini or Franco. It's like Earth, but not our Earth. Oddly, while I could accept this, in this alternate reality there apparently IS a Judy Garland and the song \"Over the Rainbow\"--an odd blending of the real and the fanciful. Most of the story, you have no idea what led to this ruined world that is now devoid of all life--no animals, no people...not even bugs. Slowly, some of the details of this apocalypse come out...but never is there ever a full explanation as to what happened and why--just a dribbling of information here and there. What you positively know is that instead of living beings, there are a group of very small and oddly designed burlap covered dolls--with very high tech eyes. Why these dolls are there and their purpose is unknown to them, but some are just happy to hide and avoid the hellish mechanical creations that inhabit the rubble as well. As for the burlap creatures, this is a shortcoming in the film. While 9 is the \"designated hero\", he and the rest of them really don't have any personality and a few of them seem like story clichés (such as the \"strong and plucky female\"). So, when one dies you are left wondering what made that one any different than the one that was killed moments earlier or you are left feeling a caricature died--not something tangible. No real character development occurs nor are their motivations particularly clear throughout the film. Nor, for that matter, does the story answer many questions at all. So, provided this doesn't bother you and you don't mind a vague story with vague characters, you'll enjoy the film very much--it certainly is a visual delight. If you demand clarity, then I suggest you see another film.",
         "Man I got to tell ya it is so nice to see something different that has the intensity of a mature movie yet lies within the realm of the animated world. Every scene was beautifully done and you can literally hang every frame up on a wall if you so choose to. The story was great, the suspense was amazing. Who ever complained about it not having a story, tell that to the crowd I saw jumping every so often from the intense confrontations. What I also liked about it was the hidden parts of the story. They give you enough information to enjoy the film but yet you can extract more of the back ground thought that went into what we saw in the completed film. For the first time ever I saw half of the audience stay behind after the credits role to not just see who worked on the movie but to debate back and forth about what they thought of it, what the characters represented, what happen in this or that scene, and of course the animation style and technique and how it moved them. Never seen anyone ever do that after watching a movie.",
         "I might have had my expectations too high when I walked into the theater. I hadn't done any reading and was under the impression that Tim Burton had directed it. So when it became obvious 5 minutes into the movie that once again I was going to be subjected to big budget stylistic environments and effects sans any kind of real mental engagement, I was pretty disappointed. There were so many problems with this movie I don't really know where to begin without rambling. So instead I'll just say that the \"good\" is all about the visuals. The \"bad\" is all about my issues with plot and character development, audience education, cheesy dialog and unambiguous morality in circumstances that should force compromise at every turn. Being any more specific would result in a hideously long post, so here are my top 3 gripes: - The story advances too quickly early on for the sake of setting up the second half of the movie. It left me with an empty feeling akin to throwing away dinner so you can have dessert. - At the core of our protagonists identities is the idea of a multifaceted human soul (i.e. aspects of our personalities captured in discrete pieces of our immortal selves). Unfortunately, almost no time is devoted to explaining or developing this concept. It's up to the viewer to decide if they care or not and why. Beyond the heavy handed symbolism of the church Stitchpunks vs the university Stitchpunks, there isn't much of a reason you have to. The idea felt like a convenient foil device instead of the meaningful linchpin it could have been. - The \"successful\" outcome of the movie is dependent on a wildly lucky string of events. There's no solid story here about bravery in the face of adversity, intelligent heroes, clever plot twists, and a few narrow escapes. Instead you get a chain of formulaic action scenes in which any of a few hundred close calls gone wrong prevents our happy ending. Give me an engaging story, not an account of winning the lottery 5 times in a row. See Secret of Nimh for a reasonably good animated noir counterexample. Ultimately, I could probably sum up the mass of problems with \"target audience confusion\". On the surface, it seems aimed at a more mature set of folks (13 years +?) with its graphic wartime theme and truly creepy villains. The development of everything else and the simplistic dialog feels targeted at a younger audience. It probably could have worked well as either. Tone it down, keep it short and sweet for the 9 year old set or lengthen it and spend more time on story, characters, etc for the older crowd. It fails in targeting both.",
         "The first time I heard about 9 and found out that Tim Burton and Timur Bekmambetov were co-producing it, I was absolutely on board to see it. Anything that the guy who directed such quirky masterpieces as Beetlejuice, Batman, Mars Attacks!, Ed Wood, and Sleepy Hollow got behind had to be worthy of my time. And then you add the genius of Russian director Timur Bekmambetov to the mix and to me it was a no brainer. I was going to see this movie. Burton AND the guy that has brought us such visually complex and action-packed fare as Wanted, Night Watch, and Day Watch supporting a movie? It had to be good. And it was. Director Shane Acker borrows maybe a little more than he should have visually from other such apocalyptic films like Terminator and even Wall-E, but it doesn't end up hurting the film by any means. The scenery and landscapes of the film are beautifully crafted and set everything up for a certain feeling of loneliness and hopelessness. It's more graphic and suspenseful than any children's or youth feature you would take your kids to, so definitely don't let the fact that this is animated fool you. This is not for the little ones. The voice actors all put their best foot forward and deliver. You've got Elijah Wood as 9, once again convincingly leading a group of survivors in what seems to be an unwinnable war against a much larger foe than they could be expected to defeat. You've got Christopher Plummer playing 1 as an interesting paranoid \"keeper of the secrets\" which reminded me of the Dr. Zaius character in the original Planet of the Apes films, if you've seen any of those. Legendary actor Martin Landau plays 2, who is a scientist and fixes 9. Then there's Jennifer Connelly, who plays the strong-willed and rebellious 7 who has left the core group of \"stitchpunks\" to get away from under all of 1's rules. Last but not least, you've got Crispin Glover playing the slightly obsessed and seemingly crazy 6 who has been drawing strange symbols since the big war between the humans and machines. The film had an interesting plot that got a bit more complex in the end. Part of the complexity had a spiritual vibe to it that I didn't necessarily care for. It just seemed almost out of place and like the director was stretching for something that would make the film more \"sophisticated.\" I was not disappointed in the movie by any means. It was a visually striking piece of film. It was action-packed and fun without dumbing down the story or sacrificing it. If you're into sci-fi, apocalyptic thrillers, and animation I would highly recommend this.",
         "Shane Acker has a good career ahead of him. At the least, one can only hope so. His talents expressed here, his first feature adapted from his short film of the same title, are immense and sharp and clear and dark and staggering and other words I didn't have time to look up for this review. He takes a scenario one could be familiar with- entities battling robotic elements in a future or just another time period, a desolate wasteland, a possibility of hope on the horizon- but it's infused with the passion and archetypes of a fairy tale. And even with this there's certain twists, or unexpected pleasures. You'll see a lot of critics talk about the lack of a full story, of the beauty of the animation and look of the film outweighing any kind of story or clearly defined characters. You can take that to heart before seeing the film, but a lot of them may have missed Acker's intention here. These are some archetypes on screen, sure. And one may have seen them in films made by the likes of Don Bluth with the Secret of NIMH or, dare I compare, Henson/Ozs' the Dark Crystal (here the latter's object of purpose is reversed, sort of). But the characters in 9, the ones with personalities, are not complete. The idea in the film is that all of the characters, all numbered from 1 to 9 and called as such, are little robotic creations given life by parts of the soul of a scientist who gave himself up for his creations. Others he made, a 'machine' for it, was also imperfect - so much so that it turned against its creators and did what giant gorram robots do when created with human's own defects. So the characters may appear to be things we very simply identify- hero guy, hero girl, slight comic-relief twins, and the grumpy and ornery older one (#1)- and as it goes on the characters simply are what they are... actually, 1 develops a little more, and in a subtle, captivating way. But if you're going to see an animated film this year for its distinctive style and design and (yes) cinematography and creations and colors out of the netherworld of a glorious imagination - and it's not from John Lasseter's Disney or Pixar - it's 9. And damn the torpedoes is this movie beautifully wretched to look at! One can see why Tim Burton and Wanted's Timur Bekmambetov latched on to Acker and helped him get the movie made as it is: it's a world like Terminator Salvation, only if it had actual focus and a capacity to elicit a terror in its audience (young or old). The little robots themselves are cute in a rough way, and the robots - and specifically what they do to one of the critters when they capture one of them by sucking out their souls - move and react like inhuman things that do what they should and look and feel like the world really has ended. You simply can't take your eyes off the movie, and it's animated with such an eye for original detail. At the same time it doesn't aim directly at adults, albeit with a PG-13 rating. I can imagine, or at least would hope to, that a child watching this and being bewildered and confused and mortified and entranced, just as I was watching NIMH or Crystal, and that's a good thing. PIXAR has its wonders, but to see this is to see the A-game upped another notch in the medium and its potential. There are times I didn't even feel like I was watching just animation. Other times, I was taken away like any good fantasy or fable: in the one little moment of respite, 'Somewhere Over the Rainbow' plays on a record and there's peace... until it's broken. It's rare a filmmaker can conjure something like that, but 9 has that in spades.",
         "Much like Shane Acker's short (of the same name), this movie almost REQUIRES multiple viewings for the viewer to really soak everything in. The first time I watched the film, my initial criticisms were \"That was too short\" and \"There wasn't not enough emphasis on characters/story\". However, after watching the movie a second time, I realized that I had missed a TON of information on my first round. Upon asking other friends what they thought about the movie the second time around, I discovered that they felt the same way. The first time I watched the film, I felt like everything flew by. It was visual overload, and it just had bad pacing overall. However, on my second viewing of the movie, I noticed that things seemed to go by much, much slower. The pacing seemed better. I noticed character and plot subtleties that I simply did not catch the first time I watched it. I connected more with the stitchpunks, and I understood the story better. The visuals weren't just \"Ohhh, pretty!\" anymore, they had greater symbolism, and depth. The movie is, indeed, about 20 minutes too short. Certain characters needed more screen time, and certain points in the plot needed more emphasis. HOWEVER, I found that I enjoyed the movie drastically more when I saw it a second time. I plan on seeing it a third time later this week. This movie reveals new surprises every time you watch it. If you have seen it once already, and didn't think it was that great, I strongly suggest dropping the $8 and giving this movie a second chance. You may be surprised how much your opinion changes.",
         "This movie feels like it starts in the middle. I don't instinctively identify with robot rag dolls. So, for most of the movie I didn't care much about what happened to them because their plight, purpose, and origin are not explained at all until the movie is almost over. At that point, I felt like \"Oh, okay, if they had explained that in the FIRST 15 minutes of the movie, I might have cared what happens\". But they didn't explain it, and I didn't care what happened. I won't even go into the conclusion of the \"story\", except to say that it makes no sense at all and is riddled with holes and ambiguity. Yes, the animation is very nice. Yes, there are some decent action scenes. Those are the strongest points of the movie. But, honestly, beyond the unique look and style of the artwork, it's the same stuff, the same action, that you see in every other animated movie. Ho hum. Summary: nice animation, cliché action, underdeveloped plot, and very little story to pull the (over age 16) viewer in.",
         "9 is a rag-doll who wakes up after a war between humans and machines that has devastated the world and wiped out humanity.He later meets a group of surviving rag-dolls and he tries to convince them to save 2.9 and 5 go to save 2, but they accidentally awaken a machine known as Brain.After they escape the dreaded machine, Brain hatches a scheme to build machines and hunt down the remaining rag-doll survivors. \"9\" is like a combination of \"The Terminator\", \"War Of The Worlds\", and \"Wall-e\".With the war, machines, and apocalypse, there's no way you can disagree with that.The PG-13 rating is most certainly deserved.Afterall, the imagery is a bit frightening and will have young kids begging for their parents to take them to see \"Wall-e\" so they can get all of the disturbing images out of their minds once and for all.As for the movie, I can't say that I was disappointed.With it's spectacular visuals, great action sequences, and convincing characters, \"9\" is a must-see for those who want to take a visually thrilling roller-coaster.Clocking in at a brief 79 minutes( 72 minutes if you take out the end credits), \"9\" will take your imagination and put it into a world that will make you want for a sequel.We all know what the title would be, so I don't need to go any further.\"9\" deserves a 9."

The world he has awakened in is frightening, but he quickly learns that he is not alone and that there are others like him, also with a single digit written on their back. The first one he encounters is 2 who tells him something of what happened to the world. 2 is also thrilled with the disk 9 is carrying, one with three unique symbols on the front. 9 soon learns that the disk and some of the other dolls who are prepared to die for the good of humankind may be the last hope for man's salvation.",
         "When 9 first comes to life, he finds himself in a post-apocalyptic world where all humans are gone, and it is only by chance that he discovers a small community of others like him taking refuge from fearsome machines that roam the earth intent on their extinction. Despite being the neophyte of the group, 9 convinces the others that hiding will do them no good. They must take the offensive if they are to survive, and they must discover why the machines want to destroy them in the first place. As they'll soon come to learn, the very future of civilization may depend on them.",
