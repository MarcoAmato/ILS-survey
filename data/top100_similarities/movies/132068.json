         "A French production about the Algerian War of Independence. Viggo Mortensen. Nick Cave and Warren Ellis handling the OST. That was easily enough to hook me into this. Daru's (Viggo) history is hidden in smoke when the movie starts, as he calmly teaches young children\u0085 About France, and French geography. So we know that he is involved with the settlement of the French in Algeria in some way, but something has caused his retreat to the Atlas mountains to teach. We aren't told why, but it is made visually obvious by the extended, incredible panoramic shots of these mountains. His retreat to a peaceful life is shattered, as he is handed a prisoner, a dissident against the French settlement who is to be escorted to a trial and, ultimately, execution. This hand-off occurs early in the movie, and throughout the journey makes for some emotional scenes as the two extremely different men slowly understand each other. Despite Daru's protests, the prisoner Mohamed has accepted his fate. Much to Daru's angst then, they begin their journey. It seems like half the film is made up of distant, landscape shots; I was staring mouth agape, my eyes scanning over the big screen to take it all in. These shots are difficult not to stare at, but they aren't simply of the mountains \u2013 as the movie progresses we see similar shots, but in these we can just make out a track, and even smaller are the two journeymen who look like ants, even on a cinema screen. If that isn't a visual metaphor for the exhaustive journey the two have in front of them, I don't know what is. It also shows just how far away from home both men are \u2013 in completely different ways. They are in the same boat, trying to keep it from sinking, yet they on the surface they couldn't be more different. The film's concept certainly is nothing special: Two people making a long trek across dangerous territory, facing their own mortality, their values and beliefs. The film's exploration of character gives it depth and humanity, while conversely the pair's journey is filmed like a Western, with the raging war for independence providing a violent background to their struggles. Both men have stakes in this war, though again these are very different, and at first unclear. While very different men in many different ways, the one thing they do share, and the one motif that consistently rears its head is honour, and the different ways this value can be interpreted, both during war and otherwise. Themes like this dominate the film (and not in a bad way!) as the journey of the two men is an intimate study of selflessness, doing the right thing, respect, and loyalty. For the most part, this film could easily be transferred to one of many Middle-Eastern countries. Which is in many ways very unfortunate, as many people and countries are still fighting for individuality and freedom from oppression and war. There is no doubt that this notion was considered when writing this film. Unsurprisingly, Viggo is stellar in his role, speaking a slightly accented French to match his Algerian born character. If it were anyone but Viggo you could accuse him of showing off! But he does it so naturally and fits into the film's world so well that you just can't help but admire the guy. Reda Kateb, as the dissident/prisoner, plays an apt and very somber role, fitting his character. Both are essentially in every scene, but the film is far from boring, as not only do we gradually find out more about these two and their respective pasts, what they endure in the final act will have you on your toes. One last thing that was very noticeable to me was the sound-editing and mixing. The use of silence, sounds of harsh winds when appropriate and an ambient OST all combine to create an incredible atmosphere. This combination also creates a unique feeling of tension throughout, especially when the music slowly creeps up on you, letting you wonder where the long trek will lead both men. This effect of tension is heightened drastically when the story takes a sudden, sharp turn. I know I jumped out of my seat a couple of times, not due to anything surprising, but due to the incredible use of music to accompany the images on-screen. This is Cave and Ellis' fifth effort at a soundtrack (I could be wrong on that number) and their second with Mortensen. Somehow I think they have a knack for this! With the most slight of alterations from the source short story by Albert Camus, combined with other texts he wrote about Algeria in the 30's, director David Oefhoffen has created a seamless adaptation. The film certainly doesn't go down the track one would expect from this type of film, which it must be praised for. It is a pity, then, that the last 20 minutes of this film feel so tacked on and separate from the tone set by the first 80 minutes. It almost felt as if they wanted to get past the 90-minute mark, where in reality this film would have been a lot better if it had ended at the 80 minute mark. This is the only major flaw that I could see, that and perhaps the unoriginal narrative. This is obviously a film for those who are fans of foreign films, art films, or Viggo Mortensen. I happen to be a fan of all three so I was very satisfied! www.epilepticmoondancer.net",
         "The movie is timeless, with a great story, breathtaking landscapes and Viggo Mortensen - as always - excellent, and he speaks at least three foreign languages in this French movie. A must seen movie and the best one I have seen all this year 2015. You have in this feature the sad and beautiful story of a short and poignant friendship during war in Algeria. Two very different men who will have to fit together, against all odds. I think Viggo Mortensen does well to play in 'little movies',his acting is getting better and better as he is getting older. I saw the movie with only 15 people in a little cinema. What a shame that big cinema buildings don't show this one. But I don't mind, then all the people are at least interested! Everybody should go to the cinema to see this excellent drama!!!",
         "There is something eerily enigmatic in seeing a lone teacher in a one-room school in the middle of nowhere. It was used to great effect in Ted Kotcheff's re-discovered 1971 Australian classic Wake in Fright and director David Oelhoffen conjures similar ambiance in his ultimately gripping Algerian-based drama Far From Men. Set in 1950s Algeria against a backdrop of growing civil unrest to French colonial rule, Daru (Viggo Mortensen), is an apparently unassuming French teacher in a remote and barren outpost, educating young Arab children on matters French with no apparent nod to their own heritage. His isolated retreat is broken by the manacled arrival of Mohamed (Reda Kateb) on a charge of the murder of his cousin. He is ordered to take the prisoner to the nearest French administrative centre where he knows full well that after a perfunctory trial, the Arab will be found guilty and executed. More than reluctant to undertake this task, which he clearly views as accessory to a killing, events take a dramatic turn leaving the diffident teacher with no moral alternative but to undertake the task. The film then follows their journey as they head out over rocky, mountainous terrain. Oelhoffen and cinematographer Guillaume Deffontaines take full advantage of the Algerian desert landscape, frequently showing the two men pitted against its magnitude and harsh, extreme conditions. It is exceedingly well shot, drawing the audience in with its captivating imagery. Music from Australians Nick Cave and Warren Ellis was unobtrusive. Initially slow-burning, the film bursts into energy with gripping drama, twists and turns. As the back stories unfold, the surprising resilience and phlegm shown by the quiet teacher is understood. The conclusion was unexpectedly poignant. The concept and themes of two diverse men on a road journey pitted against elements and events far bigger than them are not unfamiliar. But the injection of unexpected plot devices and character development keep the film fresh and the audience engaged. Performances from both Mortensen and Kateb are strong and the two actors gel together well.",
         "A quiet and touching study in love, respect, and morality beautifully acted by Viggo Mortensen and Reda Kateb. As the world swirls around each of them, each facing violence and death in their own universe, fate brings them together and each is saved by the other. A wonderful meditation on setting aside hatred and violence to reach the inner core that each of us carries within. Do not let the pace frustrate you; parts move as snails, which is what Viggo's parents were called by the French. Set in and amongst the bloody Algiers civil war of the 1950's, one comes to appreciate the need to reach out, not only to those with whom we interact, but to teach the children the universal humanity of us all. This movie, like the great Japanese movie Departures (2008), asks us to put aside the petty hatred, twisted customs, and violence of much of what we call life, and appreciate the beauty and love we can share with our fellow humans. An absolutely lovely film.",
         "Brilliant performances by Mortensen and Betak, who play two men and show their story in a war torn 1950s Algiere. The film has a progressive build of relationship between the two characters which is fantastic. They evolve deeply and create definite emotion throughout film; a fantastic effort with character development. Definititely one of Mortensen's best performances. If a film is better than just good I will usually give it a 7.5-8. This french slow paced drama scrapes itself a 9. It exceeded my expectations. It accomplished conveying the story very well. An original score from Nick Cave as well, which perhaps has a slight hint of a downfall. So far one of the two best European films of the year.",
         "If you want to talk about the enduring relevance of star power, consider the fact I only went to see Loin des Hommes to see Viggo Mortensen in action. Fortunately, the film surrounding him was pretty darn good too. The story takes place in the luscious, green\u0085deserts of Algeria, specifically in 1954, during the Algerian War. (At least I can add it to the growing list of films about conflicts I had no prior knowledge of\u0085) Daru (Viggo Mortensen) is a teacher to a small group of children. One day, his class is interrupted when he is asked to escort a prisoner, Mohamed, (Reda Kateb) to a city where he will face trial. Though he first rejects the idea, especially after he violently clashes with several of the prisoner's pursuers, he finds it in his heart to escort him. Letting him go by himself would only result in his death and Daru would feel partially responsible. Thus begins a road trip of sorts, albeit a very dark one. You can pretty much predict what'll happen (male bonding, etc.), but it doesn't diminish the film's impact in the slightest. If anything, their growing relationship is very believable. But the film's true achievement is its handling of themes like codes of conduct, laws and honor. Almost every source of tension arises from people's differing codes of conduct. Mohamed killed his nephew, because the cousin stole his grain. This would've meant the death of his family. Now, others feel compelled to kill Mohamed in retaliation. Mohamed, however, feels it right to turn himself in as this would ensure the cycle of revenge would end with him \u2013 otherwise his little brothers would be honor bound to avenge him again, and so on and so on. Though Daru is hesitant at first, his conscience compels him to escort Mohamed anyway, though his involvement causes several deaths. Later, Daru and Mohamed watch on as two surrendering rebels are mercilessly shot down. Daru tells the commanding officer he's committed a war crime, to which the officer replies he was merely following orders. Following those orders is inhumane , but disobeying isn't exactly a life- and career-enhancing option as well. The whole film deals with conflicts where people's orders, morality, beliefs and so on inevitably end in violence. In the middle of it all, Daru wants to avoid conflict, the impossibility of which is aptly shown during an early scene where his school is attacked by Mohamed's pursuers. Daru breaks a window, shouting how he doesn't want to harm them moments before shooting outside to secure his own safety. One final mentioning of Mortensen's acting can't be omitted. His acting is, as ever, quite natural. It's also stunning how he, an American, speaks several languages here in what is basically a foreign language film, and yet it never feels unnatural; it never feels like he's showing off or something. I recently read an interview with Mortensen where he said he just wants to be in films that he could easily watch years from now. Loin des Hommes is one he can definitely add to that ever-growing list.",
         "Daru (Viggo Mortensen)is a second-generation Spanish-Algerian, teaching Arab children in a remote school during Algeria's struggle for independence. He is viewed as a Frenchman by the Arabs, and as an Arab by the French. He gets saddled with the task of taking Mohamed (Reda Kateb), a common, that is non-political, criminal to the authorities in Tinguit. The pair encounter Algerian freedom fighters, French soldiers, Arab tribesmen, stunning landscapes and more along the way. At each turn, Daru's values, culture, position and assumptions are thrown into question, and his bond with Mohamed deepens. Yet at all points this remains a movie with a compelling storyline and beautiful cinematography. There is never a hint of heavy-handed social commentary or political soap-boxing. As a thriller/adventure, or character drama, it would be excellent. But through Daru and Mohamed's developing relationship, the social and political fabric of Algeria is explored at the same time, with exquisite but down-to-earth sensitivity, from the points of view of two ordinary, honest, and in their different ways fundamentally good men.",
         "This is a story about a fraternity that goes beyond cleavages and prejudices. A quiet and brave rebellion against nonsense of violence. Charlie, Niger... That's so cruelly acute to current events. No doubt this story, that takes place in Algeria in 1954, could have been transposed in 2015 or later. The film is beautiful, it takes its time without being never boring. Action and contemplation are wonderfully balanced. The relationship between two men, both excluded from their communities, \"étrangers\" (foreigners) in more than a way, is moving. Each of us is an Arab or a paria for someone else. Reda Kateb, Viggo Mortensen and the Atlas are glowing, simply fascinating.",
         "Far from Men is relevant to today's political and social situation. Set in a country torn apart by original inhabitants rebelling against invading forces -- and caught in the middle, the ordinary people trying to get on with their lives. Sound familiar? My friend and I could not speak when the film ended, it made such an impact on us. The performances by Kateb and Mortensen are so believable that the audience is swept up into their world rather than watching them act. Set in the stark desert of Algiers, the characters'futile scramble to some safe place is gripping and all-encompassing. One of those films whose scenes haunt you days and months after. Highly recommended: I would see it again.",
         "There are those who fight and even kill for something as little as wounded pride. As ridiculous as this may seem, there are many situations and places where revenge the only option. Revenge is not just expected, it is demanded or even mandated. It takes an extremely strong and courageous person to break the cycle of violence. \"Far From Men\" takes viewers into the misty Atlas Mountains of Algeria in 1954 and the lives of two men who are trying to break the revenge cycle. It is the beginning of an uprising against the French. Daru, a local school teacher as well as a World War II veteran, is tasked with transporting a prisoner, Mohamed, to a nearby town for trial. Daru chides Mohamed for weakness and cowardice in not attempting to escape or doing much to resist those who hound him. \"React!\" screams Daru, \"aren't you a man?!\" Yet things are not so simple. As the two men travel in the moonlight, rainfall and cold of the night, Daru gradually understands the difficult and challenging choices that Mohamed faces. Daru may be able to help Mohamed, yet at what price? Viggo Mortensen plays Daru and represents him extremely well. I really enjoy the roles that Viggo plays. Usually, as here, Viggo's characters struggle for justice, truth and dignity against formidable odds. All the actors do a fine job in this film. The film images, organization, dialogue, depth, directing, themes and storyline, are also very well done. Really the only things lacking are a fabulous soundtrack, a certain amount of depth to each nuance of the film and, perhaps, a love interest. Far From Men became available on Netflix this week.",
         "A beloved teacher in Algeria with French parents (Viggo Mortensen) is forced to escort a man accused of murder (Reda Kaleb). After a while, both claim their freedom avoiding positioned to either side and surviving on the hard journey to a place free from religious or law enforcement groups. Viggo Mortensen offers impeccable work and one of skill, daring here with Arabic and fluent French; in this adaptation of a short story by Albert Camus moving in the grounds of the western with a halo of strong humanism. The splendid interpretations of Viggo Mortensen and Reda Kateb come to move us, to evolve their friendship and integrity of their souls and ideals. This evolution director Oelhoffen prioritizes the film visually watching the tape, by referring to a kind of twilight western. His wonderful photograph is enough to enjoy this film has the infallible Mortensen, whose role is very credible reason. A story that reconciles us with virtues as courage, honor, dignity, loyalty and narrated everything with elegance and great music. A film of great human feeling, strong and full message and still confirming Mortensen as one of the most charismatic and delivered to their current film projects interpreters.",
         "What a pure delight this terrific movie made in natural settings. We find here Viggo Mortensen at his very best, at his peak. The kind of lonesome, tired hero as he was in HISTORY OF VIOLENCE or EASTERN PROMISES, although quite different, but somewhere similar...The kind of hero whom I have always been in love with. Far from the super hero on whom I puke. I hate. Rade Kateb gives also here a powerful performance, as usual. You have in this feature the sad and beautiful story of a short and poignant friendship during war in Algeria. Two very different men who will have to fit together, against all odds. A gripping, poignant drama that made me weep. The school teacher's character played by Mortensen is terrific. One of the most brilliant performances I have ever seen since a long time, believe me. I will comment soon another movie about war in Algeria, a rare film named L'OPIUM ET LE BATON. Back to this one, I would have imagined Madds Mikaelsen in Motensen character. Those two are tremendous actors, very similar in many ways. But that's my own opinion.",
         "This is an action movie of the mind, of the soul. Based on Albert Camus's short story The Guest, this in effect sums up the writers philosophy with clarity and insight. It was shot in Algeria which presents a perfect backdrop - both because it was where Camus grew up and because the stark but beautiful scenery fits perfectly with the story.(It even hints at Camus's own life in Algeria. He was of the working class - real working class, like working with their hands - and with Spanish heritage.) It takes the Camus story a bit further - but always with elements that was in fact part of Camus's life. For anybody who fondly remembers existentialism and how it analysed our human predicament, this movie will be a reason to celebrate. For those who does not know it, but is clever enough to agonize over our predicament - like how do we save our humanity when life forces us into situations that show that we are NOT \" fully in control of our destiny\" - start here. The acting is superb and the directing is brilliant - and obviously done by someone who understands Camus. Do not expect special effects or action hero stuff. This story goes deeper than that. Far deeper. It is in French but as the dialogue is on the sparse side, the subtitles for English speakers are easy. A movie of a great idea wherein the message, the dialogue and the filming merge together into a powerful statement.",
         "Sometimes it doesn't take much to win me over. Pair stunning vistas of the Algerian desert with a melancholic score from Warren Ellis and I'm there. Far From Men boasts a rugged aesthetic, and despite its frequent violence it has a big heart. Geared to highlight the moral compass of its protagonist played by Viggo Mortensen, his moments of anguish are the film's most tender and compelling moments. Perhaps director David Oelhoffen is a little too kind to his characters, giving the killers so many redeeming aspects that it breaches sentimentality. It quickly retreats from sappiness however, and finds a sweet spot, if not quite as complex as it could be. Though on the other hand, I don't know much about the Algerian war to understand the culture conflicts but the themes of justice are universal. Though some of the moral dilemmas are a little stilted and it spends too long just trekking in the desert at the expense of a tight economy, the narrative development is noticeably well-structured. None of the flaws are clunky enough to hold the film back and it's a well- executed marriage of sensitive compassion in spite of prejudices with tense action sequences. 7/10",
         "It was movie that touched a string and left my mind empty of thoughts. Those views of the Algerien desert were magnificent. They pointed out something that we seem to forget again again: we are so small in the background of nature. I've often read in books about how the immensity of the desert humbles human beings but I never understood what it meant. Living in a place like that seems to have made the school teacher realize how precious is life and how small is the importance of human squabbles. Quiet... That seems to be the predominant sound of the movie. Or more likely peace, a peace that Daru attempts to keep by turning a blind eye to the chaos that seems to start brewing around him. However, eventually he can not bring himself to sacrifice his values in order to keep his peaceful life. The movie also shows the incipient stages of what we today call terrorism. Daru's perspective is very interesting. As a child who is born by Spanish parents in an Arabic country and who is also a French citizen he belongs to three nations and to none in the same time. Thus he has insight on all three cultures from a rather impartial perspective. He is not touched by excessive nationalism and can see analyze their cultures from a wider point of view. We can see in this movie what could be called the calm before the storm. The inhabitants of the Arabic world are starting what they call a \"revolution\". From their point of view their actions represent their path to freedom, liberation from the oppression of foreign tyranny. We are used to see the terrorists as villains but perhaps they are victims just as match as we are.",
         "Since finishing his stint in the mighty Lord of the Rings trilogy as Aragon and becoming a poster boy for fantasy fans all over the world, Viggo Mortensen's career has been anything but formulaic. From de-clothed fights in seedy saunas in his Oscar nominated turn in Eastern Promises, violent outings in A History of Violence, raggedy wasteland wanderings in the grim yet beautiful The Road through to ventures in foreign films like Alatriste and Jauja (a film in which he also composed the score), Mortensen has seemingly shunned the easy option and instead pushed himself to deliver unique and testing motion pictures. Doing so means that Mortensen has also opened himself up to fail as equally as fly and falling somewhere in between this spectrum is this French language film Far From Men. A hybrid of a straight up drama, a war fable and also in many ways a more modern day Western (even though the year of the setting is 1954), Far From Men is an on face value a simple story of Viggo Mortensen's rural school teacher Daru, a man with a colourful backstory and his trip across the barren plains of Algeria unwillingly transporting accused murderer Mohamed (played by A Prophet's Reda Kateb) but director David Oelhoffen uses this simple tale as a metaphor for the life and times of these men at the time of civil unrest and it's a metaphor that will get lost on many as the films pace and narrative pushes forward at an ever so slow pacing. Even at just under 100 minutes of running time, Far From Men consistently loses steam in ponderously paced scenarios and even when moments of genuine life and death are taking place, the film still feels a little too withdrawn to pack a legitimate emotional wallop and even though Mortensen and Kateb are an effective double team, they can't make the characters they're portraying overly memorable despite an effective and resonate final few minutes of screen time together. Well shot by Oelhoffen (the countryside is often starkly beautiful) and moodily scored by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis, Far From Men is a well-produced event that also features yet another interesting point in the career of Mortensen but by the time this snail paced journey of mismatched culture's and subtle history lessons are over, Far From Men will quickly disappear far from your memory due to a lack of true emotional investment or memorable situations. 3 unlucky horses out of 5",
         "The makes of the film do a great job of recreating the turmoil that was French-occupied Algeria in the late 1950s in the spirit of \"The Battle of Algiers\" (1960), and the movie is fairly true to the spirit, if not the letter, of Camus' short story on which the film was based. As Camus is one of my top five all-time writers, I had to go, much as my wife, who loves Woody Allen films, requires us to go to each new offering. However, the main problem with the film for most Americans is that most Americans know little about the Middle East and North Africa, even as our soldiers die there fighting in non-wars. \"Two very different men thrown together by a world in turmoil are forced to flee across the Atlas mountains. Daru, the reclusive teacher, has to escort Mohamed, a villager accused of murder.\" Mohamed was NOT accused of murder in the Western sense. The crime of which he is accused is a matter of Arabic tribal tradition. And how he deals with his problem shows that he is NOT so very different from Daru, who has also chosen to live on the edge of society. In fact, while most Americans are standing around the water cooler discussing the latest Star Wars movie, at least some people in France will be discussing \"Far From Men\" because the topic of East- West alienation, as well as the topic of alienation within the West, are never far away from the water cooler. But it's not an easy discussion. \"The Battle of Algiers\" was made by an Italian, not a Frenchman. Although the French withdrew from Morocco and Tunisia in 1956, the French for some reason just couldn't leave Algeria, just as the U.S. just could not leave Vietnam. Both had to be shown the door in a very violent fashion that changed those nations.",
         "It's 1954 Algeria. Revolution is in the air. Daru (Viggo Mortensen) is a war veteran teaching little kids in a small remote school house. Another white teacher has been killed and he's warned to leave. He refuses since his family were longtime residents. One day, prisoner Mohamed (Reda Kateb) is brought to the school. Daru is told to bring him to town for trial. Mohamed had killed his cousin. He needs to end the blood feud by getting executed by the French. Their journey is disrupted by the two warring sides. There is beauty in the stark landscape. I like the setup until Mohamed refuses to escape after the attack. He's not much of a prisoner and that drains some of the tension. The level of duty for Daru is pretty low which also drains the tension away. Daru is projecting impossible goodness. There just isn't anything to prevent Daru from walking away. Mohamed don't seem to care about his life. There is no fight for life since both seem perfectly happy to die. I get that it's trying to say something about war and the human nature. That has some value but not much tension.",
         "I have been to Algeria a few years ago, so I was compelled to watch this movie. The movie starts slow, which was not a problem. The mood of the film didn't capture me right away, so I postponed the viewing of the second half of it. But it didn't get better, it got worse. The more sentimental conversations between the two main characters I had to witness, the less I was able to feel interested about their lives or their history. The movie seems to try to use everything - desert, music, story - to make us feel sorry for Mohamed and emphasize with Daru, but it just didn't work for me. Most of the movie seems to be about the two companions staring into the wide landscape with a melancholic look on his face. The last Mortensen movie I watched was about a male character who had to lead his son, a young boy, through a post-apocalyptic scenario, into safety. It was hardly watchable due to it's sentimental onslaught. This movie is the same, just in the Algerian desert."
