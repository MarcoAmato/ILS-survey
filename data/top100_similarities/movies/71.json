         "content": "Although panned by most critics, Fair Game (1995) is not nearly as bad as some would lead you to believe... especially if it's taken purely at face value. Based on the novel of the same name by Paula Gosling, the story had previously been filmed as Cobra (1986) starring Sylvester Stallone. For all intents and purposes, Fair Game is a decent action movie, although overindulgent in most aspects (huge explosions, gratuitous boob shots of Cindy Crawford, nudity, a famous sex scene and one-note acting). The film was designed solely as a vehicle to capitalize on the enormous popularity of Cindy Crawford, the hottest Supermodel of the 1990's... and in that respect, it had enormous success. Fair Game has become a sort of Cult classic, based on the adoration for Crawford's sex appeal and a brief, early role by Salma Hayek. As far as her bad acting goes, Cindy Crawford said it best, taking the high road with \"Oh well, at least I tried.\" Indeed, she deserves an \"A\" for effort.",

         "Can Cindy Crawford act? Not really, but well enough to scream and run from one overblown action scene to another, taking the odd breather for showers (plural) and changes of clothes. I kind of enjoyed this brainless tosh. Cinders looks great, adequately playing an uncompromising, smarty-pants attorney. Baldwin is the cop determined to guard her body when people start trying to kill her. He just about pulls off the hardass cop routine, but never really musters the enthusiasm to look like he's enjoying it. The bad guys glower and plot, hunting the fleeing pair down with ruthless skill (and some rather suspect computer trickery), then cocking things up each time allowing them to escape. It's hugely violent, fast moving, loud, full of swearing etc., all the things you associate with nineties action fodder, and finishes off with a big enough bang. Don't expect much, and you shouldn't be disappointed. Oh, and if you're wondering about nudity, Cindy does indeed \u0091get them out for the lads', and Baldwin shows his butt.",
         "In my opinion most blockbusters are watchable movies. Some are good, some are not so good. Some are even quite bad, but they try so hard to offer something for everyone that there usually are at least some things in the movie you like. But because they do offer something for everyone, they usually also have some things you don't like. However, once in a while a film comes along which focuses solely on it's own target audience. Sometimes the critics and fans of so-called 'quality cinema' are the target audience. In those cases we have films like \"American Beauty\". Sometimes fans of sex-related teen-comedies are the target audience and we have a film like \"American Pie\". And sometimes fans of pure action-entertainment are the target audience and we have a film like \"Fair Game\". This is a film which most people have a strong opinion of. Others love it while others hate it. What's interesting is that the reasons for the opinion of the film are the same for both people. Others hate it because it's unbelievably dumb, excessively violent, has an unoriginal plot, stupid dialogue and has no good actors. However, others love it for the same reasons. And I'm one of those people. The film is based on Paula Gosling's novel of the same name. It's interesting to notice that Sylvester Stallone's actioner \"Cobra\" was also based on the same novel but the films have very little in common. About the only thing they share is the hate of the critics and the love of action-fans. What's even more interesting is that Stallone was originally attached to this film as well. Anyway, about this film.. While it's true that no-one has been able to make a good macho-actioner since the 80s (except Steven Seagal and even he is now making films like \"The Patriot\"), this is a quality effort if there ever was one. This has everything I want (a macho cop as the hero, a sexy woman as his sidekick, lots of action and gratuitous violence) and nothing I don't (a deep and original plot, Academy Award-winning actors, emotional scenes between mom and daughter...). Actually many scenes here are so stupid that they could be considered campy and even if you aren't a fan of the genre, you might enjoy laughing at the movie's unintentional humor. One of the things which always means a lot to me in films is the score and \"Fair Game\" has one of the best scores I've ever heard. I liked Mark Mancina's score to \"Speed\" and \"Bad Boys\" but they're nothing compared to this. A brilliant main theme combined with excellent underscore. Full marks. There is also the traditional \"You killed my partner. Big mistake, you hear me? Wanna know why? Because I'm gonna come and get every last one of you!\"-threat from Baldwin. I love those lines, I really do. \"Cobra\" was filled with them and the mid-80s was a good time for macho-actioners. In fact, \"Fair Game\" is like a throwback to the 80s, when Joel Silver still made good actioners (Commando, Action Jackson, Die Hard, Road House - all brilliant). Of course it's not intelligent. Of course it's not original. Of course it's not a film which makes people think about their lives. It is pure action-entertainment, nothing more and nothing less. This will definitely appeal to fans of \"Cobra\", \"Action Jackson\" and the early Steven Seagal-films. However, if you don't like action, pure action and nothing but the action - skip it. Even if you liked films like \"Speed\" and \"Face/Off\", you might not like this. Gunfights, explosions, gratuitous violence, gratuitous nudity (from Cindy Crawford, no less!), a brilliant score..what more could a guy who loves action ask? Definitely a 10.",
         "I like Cindy Crawford. I really do. I respect the class she has maintained in an often classless fashion and modeling industry. But some people should stick to what they know. Cindy, my God! In this movie, you were just in your lovely apartment overlooking the water. Your apartment is then blown up, you are blown off the balcony into the water, your cat is toast and all your possessions are gone. Oh, and by the way, a bunch of very bad people are now trying to shoot you dead. You get out of the cold water, run for your life and get taken to a safe house where the 2nd rate Baldwin asks you `How do you feel?' And Cindy says with the intensity of a heroin addict, `Like my life just exploded. What is this place, Motel Hell?' She said it like she was reading the phone book! A real actress would have been looking at the cop like he was nuts! And she would have delivered the lines accordingly. It got worse. Did you see at the very first scene in the movie where Cindy's character is jogging and gets shot? Did you notice her slowing down to hit her mark and wait for the shot? I've never heard or seen anyone more stilted and lifeless except for a really bored telemarketer. The writing was just BAD, and the movie was just about look how good Cindy looks after being dumped in water and having no shower. Notice her lips still had color? Did they have the long-lasting stuff back then? Luckily it wasn't the kind of bad where you can't sit and laugh at it. You can sit and laugh at this one. In fact, you don't have a choice.",
         "Really bad and tedious with it. The mystery here was not who was trying to kill Cindy Crawford, but how her hair was magically dry and sexily tousled after a series of dunkings. Cindy has exhibited better acting in lipstick commercials. And that scene where she uses her charms to persuade the geek in the computer shop to help her was reminiscent of Ginger trying to coax a coconut from Gilligan. Silly from start to finish.",
         "Fair Game is one of those films that teaches you things you never realised were true until it happened on screen. Things like this: - Explosions that blow up a mansion, and send someone flying into the water never leave a mark on that person. But they will have blood on their clothes, irregardless. - Teams of expert assassins can be beaten by one cop. - It's not humanly possible for a bad guy to kill someone without using a one-liner first. This may explain why they don't feel any remorse. - Cars blow up on impact, regardless of where the impact is and what the impact is with. Unless of course our hero is in the car, in which case, it just catches fire. - Perfect looking fake IDs aren't necessarily done with the use of any computers. - Letters that look like 3s, but aren't, are found by typing in '3' into the computer. - Employees of small stores swear freely and loudly while on the phone in the store. - Continuity is not important. It can easily flow from late afternoon, before the sun starts to set at all, to well after the sun has set, in a matter of seconds. - Choppers can't be heard over bad sex scene music and Cindy Crawford's disinterested moaning. - Cops leave the safety off when they put their gun away. - Trained assassins watch their target do a random Baldwin brother instead of actually doing their job. - A bomb counts down from 2 minutes 57 seconds to 1 minute 47 seconds in just under 15 seconds. That bomb then proceeds to blow up everything except the room the bomb is located in.",
         "Definitely not Oscar material, but a good late night watch. Lots of action and stunts. Cindy Crawford can't act, but who cares!? The plot involves some high tech Ruskies who are after Cindy, as F.B.I. Agent Billy Baldwin comes to the rescue. There is ensuing sexual tension.",
         "The plot was stupid and the acting was so bad. Cindy Crawford can absolutely not act. And the movie didn't even have any decent nude scenes. If the people responsible for this movie are going to subject us to such garbage they can at least throw in some decent nudity so that the movie won't be a total loss.",
         "Okay, so it's got hardly any plot and what there is doesn't make much sense. So it was doomed to be slated by critics the second Cindy Crawford said yes. So the film may have the world record for the number of scenes in the trailer that aren't in the finished film. It's still far from the worst film ever made, and certainly far from the worst in the year it came out (1995 was the year of \"Showgirls,\" \"Waterworld,\" \"Species,\" and \"Congo\" for openers). Way too much senseless violence, confusing scripting (from Charlie Fletcher and an uncredited Steven E. deSouza), and frenzied editing for sure, and Cindy's Oscar is unlikely to be coming any time soon - but she's no worse than the rest of the cast (and unlike Steven Berkoff, at least SHE hasn't sunk to doing a Jean Claude Van Damme film since). She's actually pretty good more often than not, and her punches are more convincing than some male actors (though hitting the smuggest of the smug Baldwin brothers provides motivation). Let's just say that the man credited as her acting coach clearly didn't see all his efforts go unrewarded. And you have to give her and the rest of the cast and crew credit; no one ever pretends that \"Fair Game\" is anything other than an unpretentious action film, which can't be a bad thing. (But then even Cindy's biggest detractors have never claimed she was pretentious.) While it is mainly for fans of the moled one, it's still short enough not to hurt, and it certainly improves on the last time the Paula Gosling novel it's based on was turned into a film (the truly awful \"Cobra\" with Sylvester Stallone), and you don't often see films starring lawyer characters doing something other than criminal law. And before you point out that no lawyer ever looked as good as Cindy Crawford, remember that that never stopped Steven Bochco - or David E. Kelley with \"Ally McBeal.\" Now who would you rather be represented in court by, Cindy or Ally?",
         "Is Cindy Crawford really supposed to be staggeringly beautiful? I mean, she's okay, with her pointy chin and beauty spot, but is she any more attractive than, say, Madeleine Stowe, Sean Young, or Jennifer Connolly? Crawford is taller than the others, true. She could be on an all-girl's Olympic basketball team. But it would be hard to rank order the beauty parade that's been on screen lately. When you get so close to the top it becomes a matter of stylistic choice, almost arbitrary. There's another woman in this movie, a homely middle-aged KGB agent who demolishes men with a single kick to the head. It could be argued that a woman with such a talent for meting out punishment might be a more exciting date than some marshmallow ex-model. Anyway, Crawford, the ex-model at hand, isn't bad. She has legs the length of a giraffe's and she takes two showers at the beginning of the movie and changes her T shirt in front of the camera once. I don't mean to be too critical of her appearance. It's no wonder that her bare midriff prompts the goggle-eyed Baldwin to put a cigar in his mouth and try to light it. I take this to be symbolism although, to be sure, \"sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.\" But then she cozzens some computer nerd so much that he winds up \"fiddling with my joystick.\" Can a joystick sometimes just be a joystick too? Of course she can't act but we can't count that as a demerit because nobody else in the movie can act either, so the absence of skill on her part is hardly noticeable. Her performance though does put on display at least one of her attractive features, in addition to the other two, and that is an endearing lisp. \"Pizza\" comes out \"PEET-tha.\" Kind of nice. Gives her a vulnerable quality, you know? Speaking of her vulnerability brings up the question of the plot, alas. See -- these ex-KGB agents try to murder her in every way possible -- shooting, blowing up her house, shooting yet again, and again. Then, towards the end, they decide she can't be killed but rather she must be interrogated. End of discussion of plot. I found myself wishing the heavies weren't all ex-Russian KGB agents because the movie was shot, after all, in 1994, five years after the collapse of the USSR, which either makes the villains out of date or the screenwriters unimaginative in their search for heavies. Maybe both. It doesn't matter really, except that there are some people of an impressionable age who might be tempted to take this cartoon as a serious reflection of reality. Their minds might be warped enough by exposure to these stereotypes that they grow up imagining all Russians have faces with the general contours and texture of potatoes. The heavies all scowl and sneer and speak with one or another foreign accent. Was it Oliver Cromwell who said, \"Take me for what I am, warts and all\"? Makeup has given the chief heavy a prominent wart right in the middle of his forehead, like a third eye, I suppose so we don't mix him up with the others. These ex-Soviet Seals are something special. They are \"experts in electronics,\" the film tells us, but that doesn't do them justice. Their equipment has positively supernatural attributes. For instance, they use an infra-red heat sensor that can not only penetrate walls but can detect that the leading lady is wearing high heels as well. And their radio direction finder can \"triangulate\" a transmitter's position all by itself. Essentially the whole movie is one long chase. None of it makes too much sense. After Baldwin saves Crawford's life a dozen times over she suddenly turns on him angrily then runs away. Shortly afterward, aboard a freight train, they have a physical fight and then she immediately falls into his arms and they make love. Unfortunately it's one of those love-making scenes in which such arty effects as dappled spots of blue light move across patches of undifferentiated limbs, and it's interrupted by one of the agents who has a laser-sight-equipped weapon that plants a red circle on Baldwin's butt. At least Crawford notices this. I can understand why Baldwin might not have. There are some gags and would-be jokes and sassy lines sprinkled through this melange of explosions and shootings and slow-motion fireballs. It doesn't add up to much but it's so slam bang that I found it kind of fun. I really do wish we had some generic villain for these types of movies though. Those impressionable minds -- the ones that can't remember the difference between Russia and the Soviet Union -- worry me at times.",
         "I was fueling at the truck stop in Florida,chatting with the hog hauler fueling at the pump next to me. He was telling me about the time he had pulled off the road to take his 8 hour break,when a bunch of Russians pulled him out of his truck at gun point. Made him open his trailer,all the time yelling \"Where are they\". One had a g.p.s. locater device. He makes his way thru the hogs and stops about half way through the trailer. Stops ,reaches down through the hop crap, and picks up a cell phone. Im thinking,\"Some truck drivers have nothing better to do but think up wild stories to tell his fellow truckers.\" Cindy Crawford,Selma Hayek,Johann Carlo, and Jenette Goldstein are hot!! ---One Truck Drivers Opinion--- erldwgstruckermovies.com"
