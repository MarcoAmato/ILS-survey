         "content": "> It's vampa time!\r\n\r\nFrankly, I was not thinking of writing a review for this. You know, some animated movies come and go unnoticed, so I believed it would be one of those. In fact, I did not like the first film much, that is the reason to watch it so delayedly and with a minimum expectation. Better late than never, well, I regret for viewing it so late. One of the best animation of 2015, maybe in the top 10 or 15.\r\n\r\nWell, it was a one liner, like, the daughter wants to move to the human social world thinking that might do good for her son's future. But her father plan to stop her getting away from him and the hotel. So those attempts are the rest of the movie. I liked the movie very much because it was very funny, especially the lines were and its accent, Adam Sandler nailed it.\r\n\r\nI have said millions of times that I don't know why Americans and critics hate Adam Sandler that much, I don't know about the rest of the world but I kind of like his films. The last few films like 'The Cobbler', 'Pixel', 'Men, Women & Children' and this one were so much better. It did not bring the old Sandler, but brought us a different and new Sandler on screen. He was definitely the main reason for this film's success.\r\n\r\nDon't just a book by its cover, well, here the cover is the previous installment. The first part was not a must see IMPO, but this is especially for the animated movie fans. PG rated movie, but still it might scare mildly for below 8 kids, only because of the theme. I had a great time with it and expecting it to do the same impact on you as well. And I can't predict the third will be as lucky as this one, lets wait and see.\r\n\r\n8/10",

      "synopsis": "It's Mavis (Selena Gomez) and Johnny's (Andy Samberg) wedding day. Dracula (Adam Sandler) is worried that she'll decide to move out of the hotel, but he decides to keep it together for her sake. One month later, Johnny tells Dracula that Mavis wants to go flying with him. They play a game of hide-and-seek, but Mavis quickly gets winded. She tells him that she can't fly very far, since she's pregnant. Dracula is overjoyed that he's going to be a grandfather, until Mavis mentions that it's possible her child will be a human. When the due date arrives, Dracula sneaks into the delivery room disguised as a nurse. He swears that no one will ever harm his grandson, before handing him to Mavis. On Dennis' (Asher Blinkoff) first birthday, there is a party, and Johnny's parents, Mike (Nick Offerman) and Linda (Megan Mullally) are invited. Also at the party are Frankenstein (Kevin James) and Eunice (Fran Drescher), Wayne (Steve Buscemi) and Wanda (Molly Shannon), Griffin (David Spade), and Murray (Keegan-Michael Key). Dracula is convinced that Dennis will grow up to be a vampire, even when Linda points out that he doesn't have any fangs. Wayne tells her that he has until his fifth birthday to have his fangs grow in. Mike tells Johnny he should get a job, but Dracula bails him out by saying that he already has a job at the hotel, making the humans feel more comfortable there. Months later, Mavis calls for Johnny and Dracula and tells them that Dennis said his first word. Dennis says \"Bleh bleh bleh,\" then repeats it over and over again. Not amused, Dracula checks inside his mouth for any sign of growing fangs, finding nothing. When Dennis is four, Dracula tries to teach him how to turn into a bat. Dennis is only able to flap his arms and run around the room. Dracula tells Dennis that he'll dance for him if Dennis will try to turn into a bat. Mavis comes in and asks what they're doing. Dracula mentions that six of Wayne's pups are having a birthday party, but Mavis doesn't want Dennis to go, since they play too rough with him. Dracula asks her if she doesn't want Dennis around monsters, and Dennis says he wants to watch his favorite video, Kakie the cake monster (Chris Kattan). Mavis points out that he hasn't yet shown any signs that he's not human. Mavis reluctantly brings Dennis to the party, and a girl pup named Winnie (Sadie Sandler) tells Dennis she loves him and they will get married. Dennis squirms away from her. Mavis is overjoyed by all of the fun things at the party, such as limbo and a piñata, though she wreaks a bit of havoc when she breaks the piñata and the werewolf pups eat the candy. In the chaos that ensues, Dennis gets knocked to the ground and one of his teeth falls out; Mavis is horrified, but Dracula excitedly rushes to see if Dennis' fangs are going to come in. She tells Dracula that she and Johnny have been talking about moving to California, so that Dennis can grow up around other humans; she still doesn't think that her son will manifest any vampire powers before his fifth birthday. Saddened, Dracula goes to see Johnny in his room. Johnny tells him that he loves it at the hotel, and doesn't want to move. Dracula tells him to take Mavis to his parents' house, while Dracula will watch Dennis. His plan is to have the monsters show their skills, so that Dennis will decide to turn into a vampire. He only has one week left before Dennis' fifth birthday. Johnny and Mavis fly away, and moments later the monsters pull up. Together, they all drive off with the Blob riding sidecar in an attached Rascal scooter. Johnny and Mavis land in Santa Cruz and rent a car. Dracula and the group arrive at the forest, and he tells Frankenstein to show Dennis how he scares people. Two joggers pass by and see him, but they aren't frightened. Instead, they ask if he will take a picture with them, which he happily agrees to do. Dracula then tells Wayne to kill a deer, and he starts to chase after one, but gets distracted when a frisbee flies by. He quickly chases and grabs the frisbee, to Dennis' delight. Angry, Dracula drives the group away, and the scooter becomes detached, sending the Blob over a cliff. Dracula says he'll be fine, since he's shapeless. Johnny and Mavis are driving through Santa Cruz, and she asks him to stop at a minimart. She gets fascinated by the potato chips and Slurpees. It's Murray's turn to try and impress Dennis, and Dracula tells him to conjure up a sandstorm. Murray starts chanting and twisting, but then he hurts his back, only producing a small sand pile that Dennis happily plays with. Johnny and Mavis see a park where kids are doing bicycle stunts, and Johnny borrows a kid's bike to show off his tricks. Mavis decides to give it a try, and is able to do floating loop-de-loops and stop in midair. They leave for Johnny's parents' house, and Mavis decides to check in on Dennis. Dennis is fast asleep when Dracula's phone rings, and he doesn't want her to know that they left the hotel. Griffin puts his sunglasses on Dennis, and moves his arms and talks for him so Mavis won't see that he's asleep. Dracula decides that he will have to teach Dennis himself. He drives them to the Vampire Summer Camp where he spent his childhood. The camp director meets them and says that Dracula was a legend as a kid. The vampire children are all eating mice. Johnny and Mavis arrive at Mike and Linda's house, and find the guest room made over with a makeshift coffin. Mavis thinks it would be a great place to raise Dennis. Linda announces that she's invited other human-monster couples over. Dracula takes Dennis and the group to the top of a 200-foot tower, and he throws Dennis off, thinking that he'd figure out how to fly before he hit the ground. One by one, the monsters look over the side and announce that he's still not flying. When he gets close to the ground, Dracula flies down and grabs Dennis. Frankenstein leans on the side of the rail, causing the tower to fall over and land in the campfire. Frankenstein is set on fire, and he runs wildly through the buildings, setting them all on fire. A tree falls and crushes the hearse. Johnny and Mavis are on the roof, and she tells him that she doesn't want Dennis to grow up in Transylvania, and end up being a freak like her. Johnny says that he'd be overjoyed if Dennis grew up to be curious and full of life like she is. His phone rings and he shows her a video that he thinks a friend sent him. She recognizes that it's Dennis falling off the tower. Frantic, she calls Dracula. Sirens are blaring as firemen try to put out the fire. Dracula answers the phone and tells her that they're still at the hotel. Dennis grabs the phone and starts to tell her that Dracula was teaching him how to fly, but Dracula smashes the phone before he can finish. Mavis tells Johnny that they have to head back to the hotel right away. Dracula realizes he has to get back to the hotel quickly, but they don't have a car. The Blob rides up on his scooter, and they all leave. Mavis decides that it will take too long to fly back on a plane, so she turns into a bat and grabs Johnny, then flies off. The Blob gets stuck in traffic, and Mavis flies through a raincloud and gets sopping wet. When the traffic clears, the Blob has to pull off the road and duck behind some bushes. Mavis flies through a thunderstorm, dodging lightning bolts. Frankenstein blows the Blob up like a balloon, and then lets go, causing him to shoot forward with them. They race a train, narrowly beating it through a tunnel. Dracula holds Dennis up in the air and lets him pretend to fly. Mavis and Dracula arrive at the hotel at the same time, and she shows him the video of Dennis falling, which has gone viral. Angrily, she tells him that she'll have his birthday party there, and then they're moving to California. The night before the party, Mavis tells Dracula that she invited his human-hating father, Vlad (Mel Brooks). Dracula pulls Johnny aside and tells him that Vlad can't know that he and his family are humans, or he'll eat them. Johnny decides to make the party a costume party. Everyone is dressed as monsters, and Johnny is wearing a cheap vampire costume. Vlad arrives with the demon Bela (Rob Riggle), and Dracula tells Frankenstein to keep him away from Mavis and the humans. Brandon, the actor who played Kakie, shows up as a performer. Vlad meets Johnny and thinks he's a freaky-looking vampire. When Vlad meets Dennis, he wants to see his great-vamp-son's fangs; when he has none, he thinks he's a \"late-fanger,\" just as Dracula was, and tells them that all they have to do is scare Dennis' fangs out of him. Kakie sets up to start his act, and Vlad makes him levitate. Mavis notices Vlad offstage and wonders what her grandfather is doing. Vlad makes Kakie's costume head spin, and then makes him act possessed. Dennis jumps into Dracula's arms. Vlad makes Kakie's body shape-shift. Dracula stops him, saying that it's not worth it. Mavis asks what's going on, and Dracula says that he was trying to scare Dennis into growing fangs. Johnny says they were desperate, and she realizes that he was in on it. All of them, along with Johnny's parents, start arguing. Upset, Dennis runs off, and Winnie follows after him. Winnie leads Dennis to a dog fort. Bela sees them and calls out more demons. Mavis and Johnny realize that Dennis isn't there, and everyone at the party runs off to try and find him. Bela swoops into the fort and grabs Dennis and Winnie, who bites his hand. Bela flings her away, causing her to crash on the ground. This enrages Dennis enough for his fangs to come in, and his vampire powers manifest immediately. Dracula, Johnny, Mavis and the rest of the monsters join in the fight, driving the demons away. Unseen, Bela grabs a sharp branch and flies straight at Johnny, trying to kill him. Just in time, Vlad, having had a change of heart, stops Bela and shrinks him, warning his former minion to never come near him or his family ever again. Mavis decides to continue raising Dennis at the hotel. Since it's still Dennis' birthday, they return to the party and get ready to eat Dennis' cake. After the gremlin lady swallows the entire cake in one bite, the party resumes and everyone has a great time, even Dracula and Vlad, who dance in typical over-the-top vampire fashion.",

         "Hotel Transylvania 2 is a 2015 American 3D computer animated fantasy-comedy film. The film is the sequel to the 2012 film Hotel Transylvania. Hotel Transylvania 2 takes place seven years after the first film, with the hotel now open to human guests. Mavis and Johnny have a young son named Dennis, whose lack of any vampire abilities worries his grandfather Dracula. When Mavis and Johnny go on a visit to Johnny's parents, Dracula calls his friends to help him make Dennis a vampire. However, an unexpected visit from Dracula's old-school human-hating dad, Vlad soon turns things upside-down. As an adult,I quite enjoyed watching this excellent movie. If you are looking for real Comedy/Adventure movie with perfect action from start to finish,then you should see this masterpiece movie.",
         "\"Hotel Transylvania\" is truly an excellent family movie with all elements of success included: good script,perfect entertainment,wonderful direction and great comedy. I saw it with my girlfriend after hearing this film has been achieving international success. Honestly \"Hotel Transylvania\" was extremely funny for adults and the movie theater was crowded. People were looking for a real comedy that would make them forget their own problems and the movie was absolutely hilarious from the beginning till the end. The voice acting was stunning and honestly this lovely film is worth seeing for all ages,you will move into another fantastic world for 90 minutes. I am not surprised at all why this movie has been number 1 in most counties around the world. Well Done!.",
         "I am a huge fan of animation.and i liked the previous part very much. So i had high expectations on this movie.but it really disappointed me. I mean the animation quality seemed to be below the standard . The comedy didn't workout as it was planned.some jokes were old and repeatedly Used.conversations seemed to be funny now and then but not to impress a lot Story line is flat.and what was supposed to be a visual treat didn't even end up being An appetizer.believe me when i say i am disappointed in a animation movie. It has all the potential to be a very good sequel but somehow they have managed Make it a average movie with poor story telling. Watch it if you want to kill time otherwise not advised",
         "It is not as good as the original. But it is still very funny. And really shows Adam Sandler who has starred in some flops recently, still has his charm as Dracula. With his girl now grown up and married Mavis to human Johnny. Played respectively by Selena Gomez and Andy Samberg. As they become parents later on to a boy named Dennis. With curly red hair and Dracula hopes he becomes a vampire like his grandfather. In order to prove he is a vampire with his only child and son in law to visit his human grandparents, Dracula and friends like Frankenstein must take off with young Dennis, without Mavis knowing about it. Mavis gets to discover a bit of the outside world along with doing things that she never did like ride a bicycle or drink slur pees. Much to Johnny's amusement. Still it is about accepting people no matter what in their hearts. Not just with words. There is a \"cameo\" with Mel Brooks as Dracula's estranged father. Not as good as the first one but still fun.",
         "The second movie, after the very good Hotel Transylvania, disappoints in every way possible. First of all, the time table of the movie is annoyingly messed up. It moves way too quickly and it just feels like you are watching flashes or rather moments from another movie. The main idea is appealing, though the final result doesn't reach the wanted result. The funny moments were few and they are not enough to save the movie. In fact, it makes you think if you are watching a movie or Fifth Harmony's promotion film, as the only moments the movie gets a little interesting is when their songs are on. Even the ending was kind of odd. Where did the kid learn all these moves when moments ago he was a scared baby? Plus, there was no surprise for the final twist. So, 2 out of 10.",
         "Well, many people says this movie sucks but I think they are saying it because Adam Sandler is in the movie but I think this is a good movie, it's funny, is not trying to be something it is not because is not a movie with a super message obviously no, it knows that is just funny, the animation is beautiful, the mayority of the characters are OK but it have some flaws and they are: it have some characters that are in the movie just because they have to be on it but they really unnecessary and boring characters. The opening scenes feel very accelerated and many things pass so fast that you can't pay attention to all of them. I would say that is as good as the first one but I think that isn't better and they are in the same place, none is better than the other. Well I'm going to give it an 8.2 of 10, it's a good movie that is really enjoyable to watch.",
         "For cartoons, Genndy Tartakovsky has had his hands in and on a lot of peoples' favorite shows. There's something about Tartakovsky's vision of cartoons that breathes life into every movement that is made by them. Tartakovsky made his directorial debut with Hotel Transylvania (2012) and although it was not universally renowned, made people found it to be a fun family movie with a well-developed story, energetic animation and colorful characters. Plus even though it dealt with Halloween related characters, the idea wasn't to scare but make light of the characters and the lore of which they originated from. Here we are with its sequel and although it does keep several elements from the original the same, some things have changed and other parts should have changed. Thankfully, this sequel isn't brought down a whole lot, but it is enough to notice the differences in what should've been focused on more. The story to this installment revolves around Dracula (Adam Sandler) trying to bring out the inner vampire of his hybrid grandson Dennis (Asher Blinkoff) brought upon by newly wedded couple/parents Mavis (Selena Gomez) and Jonathan (Andy Samberg). The reason for this is fearing that if their son has no vampire blood flowing in him anywhere, Mavis would end up leaving the hotel for good. Although the premise isn't as obvious, unfortunately the execution ends up feeling very similar to that of the first (plot wise). Dracula claims he is more open minded now but still clings to his past and tries to hide his true ambitions. In some respects, this particular play out moots the point of the first film altogether. Once Drac accepted Jonathan into his world, he should've been prepared for what came after. It just makes it feel like he didn't learn from before. The writing group for this entry shrunk in size. For the first film, five writers were involved. Here only two were, of which only one of them were from the original five. The one from the original five was Robert Smigel, a writer for multiple Saturday Night Live episodes. The other writer credited for this film was Adam Sandler and unfortunately it shows too. How? Two words, potty humor. Yes, and it sticks out like a soar thumb. Hotel Transylvania (2012) did have some silly moments but none of the comedy required potty humor. That's not to say all of the scenes don't work, but there are scenes where experienced viewers will be able to point out the scenes that Adam Sandler had wrote in. It's just not necessary. Of all problems with this and a familiar plot, that's it. For the moments that don't included immature humor, the rest of the comedy bits are new and contemporary, which is having the characters play off of their own flaws and personalities or trying to have them figure out social media. Drac can't seem to understand that to use a touch screen, you can't have long fingernails. He'll get it I'm sure. There's also new character additions to the cast, which is great although sometimes it can sink a film if it becomes over saturated. All the original characters voiced by Adam Sandler, Selena Gomez, Andy Samberg, Kevin James, David Spade and Steve Buscemi all sound exactly as they should and still play off one another well. Even Keegan-Michael Key who replaces CeeLo Green as Murray from the first film practically sounds the same too. Some of the new voice actors to jump on board or receive more attention are Sadie Sandler as Winnie (one of Wayne's children), Jon Lovitz as a \"phantom of the opera\" type character and the comedy guru himself, Mel Brooks playing Vlad, Dracula's father. It really is nice to see a bunch of new and old voice actors work together though. Plus, a star talent like Brooks isn't wasted either. His appearance isn't as long as everyone else's roles but he comes in at the best time. Again since this production was headed by Tartakovsky, the animation and character designs are nothing but great. The character designs are all unique and have intricate texture detailing. Alan Hawkins who worked as an animator for the first film serves a senior animation supervisor for this entry. Considering his past work being on projects like Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs (2009) and Arthur Christmas (2011), Hawkins feels like a great collaborator for Tartakovsky's vision. The film score produced by Devo member Mark Mothersbaugh continues his usual work but again fails to provide his listeners with an actual soundtrack for download. The score itself matches the scenes well and portrays the right emotion but it's weird that Mothersbaugh can provide a score for Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs (2009) or The Lego Movie (2014) but can't for these films. Why so selective in distribution? It's not a huge step down from the original but it is noticeable. The sequel does maintain all the character relations and chemistry while adding in new ones like Drac's father voiced by Mel Brooks. It also keeps the same great animation and music. Unfortunately although the premise feels new, the execution is very much parallel to the first film in some ways. Plus with Adam Sandler now active in writing the script, some his childish annoying potty humor got in the recipe as well and it's obvious as all get out.",
         "Okay, I really enjoyed at least the first half of the movie - it was really entertaining; it was funny and had quite a lot of adult humor. So I completely got the whole keep the families separate from each other \"If the child lives with me, they can live a normal life\". The movie did attempt to address mixed families (interracial families) (white = humans, black = monsters). I could also sense the narrative of homophobia (the child is shamed and is laughed at for liking the \"cake monster\") which was not addressed ONCE. Moreover, what the f*ck is up with the heteronormative story line in the second half of this movie. I can't even put to words my irritation at the fact that every single character was like, \"ooh you got the eyes for that girl wolf\" and sh*t like that. HE IS FIVE! This movie actually made me angry. I was going to rate it 7/10, then 5/10. Final rating: 3/10.",
         "Just got back from seeing it in theaters, and let me tell you, there were several moments when just the kids would laugh, and moments when just the adults would laugh, and even moments when everybody laughed. This is coming from a guy who doesn't watch a lot of \"kid\" movies, and I can tell Adam Sandler wanted more than just kids to enjoy it, so he threw in child-raising jokes, nipple jokes, and a few other jokes and themes that go right over your average kid's head. And of course there's silliness plentiful for the kiddies to enjoy. If you're reading reviews, you should already be familiar with the plot, which in a nutshell for those who aren't, is basically the two kids from the first one are older and married and have a kid, who the grandfather, Count Dracula, hopes is a Dracula/monster like his own bloodline, but it doesn't seem to be the case. So family relationships are slightly strained in this movie as Dracula wonders if he'll be helping to raise his vampire grandson, or watching his human grandson and human son-in-law and vampire daughter move away and leaving him behind alone in his hotel, to go live with *gasp* HUMANS. So on top of it being hilarious for everybody, there's a lot more to it as well. Obviously if you're a fan of the first Hotel Transylvania, it's a guarantee you'll enjoy this sequel. The style of animation is exaggerated, highly sporadic, like a human gas molecule with ADHD and an IV inserted coffee bag. There is a lot going on in almost every scene, and with the characters behaving so hyper, it may take a couple viewings to take in all in. The humor is quick, very in your face, but welcoming. And trust me, humor is a-plenty. There are a few minor flaws; while tailored to two separate audiences, obviously there will be moments where one side will feel out of place. Either a child will cock their head to the side in puzzlement and maybe laugh but only because the adults are, or an adult will think to themselves \"well that was just weird.\" And yes it's mostly a kid's movie so much of everything is easy to swallow. Go see it, even if you don't have kids, it's a fun, easy-going flick that's sure to make you jiggle with joy like Blobby. The characters are fun and diverse as before, humor is constant, and for those sticklers out there (you know who you are), the plot exists and it flows sufficiently enough to follow, and at a reasonable pace. So bust out your popcorn and brain juice, and enjoy this light-hearted comedy.",
         "So I just saw Hotel Transylvania 2. And yes, it is funnier and more enjoyable than the first Hotel Transylvania. I just have one complaint. One little thing undermines the entire moral of the film. The whole film is about how it doesn't matter what you are and that those that love you will accept you. The whole film is about how even if he is human Dennis will be accepted. However Mavis gives serious consideration to moving to California and nearly does even though Dennis AND Jonathan clearly want to stay in Transylvania. Here's the spoiler. Toward the end of the film it's revealed that Dennis actually is a vampire. His vampirism emerges when his best friend / possible future romantic interest, the little werewolf girl is in trouble. Here's the problem. The whole film has this ham handed message about acceptance and how it doesn't matter what Dennis is. Yet it does. It really, really does. As soon as things calm down he asks \"Since I'm a vampire does this mean we can stay at the hotel?\" And Mavis says \"Yes.\" Just yes. Nothing about how she might have stayed if she had just known and accepted that's what he really wanted. This \"cute\" moment under cuts the entire message of the film. I know that as an adult I'm probably over analyzing but it kind of bothers me because otherwise it's a very sweet and funny film. I actually don't mind Dennis becoming a vampire. That was kind of cute, especially the reason as to how. What bugged me was \"Since I'm a vampire does this mean I can stay ant the hotel?\" and Mavis says \"Yes.\" So much for what he is not mattering. What he is should not have anything to do with if they stay at the hotel or not. That undermined everything! Since there are so many complaints about Hotel Transylvania 2 I will give it this one nod of appreciation. I am very grateful that the cartoon Dracula can shapeshift into multiple forms. I miss depictions of Dracula that can become more than just a bat. Little things like that please me.",
         "More monster characters, more amusing moments and more exciting parties have upgraded an additional star rating for the hotel this Halloween season. The animation starts off immediately from where it ended previously, progresses in a moderate pacing, filled with numerous hilarious moments though with the usual ridiculous Adam Sandler type of humors, it's not overly used and creates just sufficient amount of laughter. The message about to change and to adapt in order to fit oneself into a new environment is well simplified to cater children's understanding while the eye popping, colorful visual effects together with pop styles emerging into the story are well crafted to make young adults feel like kids. Overall, the sequel is an energetic animation compared to its predecessor, heart-warming and certainly a satisfying family goers movie to enjoy.",
         "Wildly funny, bursting with energy and capped off with a sweet touch of family love 'Hotel Transylvania 2' brings it home for the audience young and old. Poor Dracula Adam Sandler \u2013 voice is very concerned that his grandson Dennis Asher Blinkoff voice isn't showing any signs of becoming a vampire. His concern deepens when he also sees the possibility that his most beloved daughter Mavis Selena Gomez \u2013 voice may leave Hotel Transylvania and move into the world of humans. So Dracula puts Jonathon through a monster boot camp when his daughter and son in law take a trip to the human world to visit the human in laws. The entire experience turns into a giant explosive and hilarious event of one cataclysmic disaster after another. Capping it all off is the appearance of great granddad and devoted human hater Vlad Mel Brooks \u2013 voice. But in the end Dennis finally shows signs that he is indeed half human and half vampire and there is a very happy birthday celebration that brings humans and monsters together at the Hotel Transylvania. This is a fun movie designed mainly for children but when I watched it I and other adults added significantly to the steady stream of solid laughter. Kudos to Sony Pictures Animation for giving us this somewhat silly but totally enjoyable fantasy film right when our real world seems to be utterly overwhelmed in events and circumstance far more scary that any that might flow form the Hotel Transylvania. Yes, it is a great escape and very much enjoyed. Odds are it won't win an Oscar, but take your kids to see Hotel Transylvania 2 and it will win their hearts and yours as well.",
         "This movie is most appreciated. My favorite in the movie is the Count Dracula. There were so many creative things put in this. I honestly did not personally like the little boy myself, whereas the Count saw so much in him being his grandson, impressive. It was cute to see the girl with her dad. I don't recall seeing the 1st installment. The father was pretty cool but a little annoying. I guess no little pets in this one save for the hundreds or whatever of the little wolf creatures. I guess the little boy was cute in some ways, save for things like the bulbous red curly hair. He was a little mushy for even if he is a little boy. Anyway, most of what makes this movie what it is is the collective work of all the artists, especially also with the storyboard sequence humor, and the voice of Dracula.",
         "Mixed marriages are tough. Couples in such situations have to join their disparate pasts into a life together that works for both of them. Their families and friends who are not used to being around the \"other kind\" may not know how to act in the couple's presence, even if everyone means well. Then there are all sorts of questions about how to raise their children. Should the kids be raised like the mother was raised or like the father? Should the family live closer to the father's family or the mother's? Should children be raised as alive or as the undead? Yup. Life can get pretty tricky when a human and a vampire marry. But watching these conflicts play out is a lot of fun in \"Hotel Transylvania 2\" (PG, 1:29). Returning for the sequel to 2012's animated hit \"Hotel Transylvania\" are director Genndy Tartakovsky, writer Rob Smigel (although gone is writing partner Peter Baynham, replaced for the sequel by Adam Sandler), and most of the voice cast from the original, with the action in the sequel picking up shortly after its predecessor's story ends. Dracula (Adam Sandler), the titular hotel's owner, is glowing like the full moon at the wedding of his vampire daughter, Mavis (Selena Gomez) to her human love, Jonathan (Andy Samberg) and Drac's on Cloud 9 (or whichever cloud he was flying through) when he hears the news that Mavis is pregnant with his grandchild. Drac is convinced that the baby will be a vampire. It's impossible to tell whether the infant favors Mavis or Jonathan, but he seems like a fully human toddler. Drac grows increasingly anxious as Dennis (Asher Blinkoff) approaches his fifth birthday (when little vampires' fangs appear), and when Drac learns that Mavis is considering moving out of the hotel and going to live with the humans. Jonathan actually wants to continue living at Hotel Transylvania, where he has started to help out with hotel operations (now that the hotel is accepting human guests), but he reluctantly agrees to take Mavis to visit his parents (Megan Mullally and Nick Offerman) in California. Drac gets them to leave Dennis in his care while they're away. As soon as mom and dad are out of sight, he packs Dennis into his car seat while, Frank (Kevin James), Wayne (Steve Buscemi), Griffin (David Spade), Murray (Keegan-Michael Key) and Blobby (Jonny Solomon) pile in to help with Drac's mission. The vampire, Frankenstein's monster, the werewolf, the invisible man, the mummy and the blob have teamed up to help bring out Dennis' inner vampire-ness. The gang visits some of their old \"haunts\" to teach the kid the tricks of the monster trade, with some pretty funny results. Dennis is enjoying all of this, but Mavis is none too happy when she finds out what her father has been up to and she (literally) flies home to protect her son. As you'd probably guess, his little road trip doesn't exactly help Drac's chances of keeping Mavis, Jonathan and Dennis under his roof. Complicating the situation further is the attendance at Dennis' birthday party by his old-school human-hating great-grandpa Vlad (Mel Brooks). \"Hotel Transylvania 2\" appeals to the eyes, the funny bone and the heart. The animation is so detailed that, at times, it almost felt like I was watching a live-action film \u2013 and I \"only\" saw it in 2-D! The script is clever, amusing, and sometimes laugh-out-loud funny. The voice actors are clearly having a good time, as was I, along with the kids and adults sitting around me\u0085 if their laughter and smiles are any indication. The story's underlying lesson is the importance of accepting others (with your actions AND your attitudes), regardless of their differences. Mavis makes this point clearly when she admonishes Drac, saying, \"Maybe you've let humans into your hotel, dad, but I don't think you've let them into your heart.\" Parts of this movie get a little dull, and some of the gags aren't as humorous as they're apparently meant to be, but most of the movie is fresh and fun. My advice is to head to the movies\u0085 oh, and grab your kids to take them to \"Hotel Transylvania 2\". \"B+\"",
         "Mavis and Johnny get married to each other and are happily living in Hotel Transylvania. Soon Mavis is pregnant and gives birth to the boy Dennis. When he is five years old, his fangs have not grown and Mavis thinks to move to California with Johnny and Dennis to give a chance to the boy to be raised among humans. Dracula asks Johnny to travel with Mavis to the house of his parents in California and convinces her to stay at the hotel. Meanwhile Dracula joins his friends Frank, Wayne, Griffin, Murray and Blobby the Blob and they travel with Dennis to a vampire camp to teach the boy to turn into a vampire so that Mavis and Johnny stay at the hotel. However neither the boy transforms nor his fangs grew. Meanwhile Mavis is delighted with the facilities in supermarket in California and she is sure that moving to California would be the best for her son. What will be Mavis' final decision? \"Hotel Transylvania 2\" is pure entertainment for families, children and adults. The plot has many hilarious gags and most of the situations are very funny. Most of the characters are adorable and even the villain Vlad changes his behavior in the end. My vote is seven. Title (Brazil): \"Hotel Transilvânia 2\" (\"Hotel Transylvania 2\")",
         "When I first heard this movie was announced I did not know what to think. The first one was entertaining, witty and brought a new spin the old story of a dad not thinking the \"slacker dude\" is good enough for his daughter. There have been many occasions where sequels either aren't as good as the original or wear out the original concept too much. This movie thankfully does neither of those things. From start to finish this movie feels fresh and unrestricted by the expectations set by the first. If you've seen any of the previews you already know the plot. Johnathan, the human from the first movie, and Mavis, Dracula's own daughter, get married and have a child which they are raising in Dracula's hotel. Count Dracula, proud of his own heritage as a monster, wishes for his grandson becoming a vampire like himself and is concerned when he does not show signs of being a monster. He also wishes to raise him the traditional monster way. This of coarse begins to clash with the human teachings from the other half of his family and cause the conflict of the entire movie. Said conflict is whether or not young Dennis should be raised in the hotel or in the monster-less safe human world. Though this plot sounds like the first one remixed, I feel it is more of a continuation as good sequels should be. The animation is on par if you've seen the first movie, which is not bad. The animation of the first movie was active and full of life and that same attention drawing quality animation is here again. Everything in this movie flows to an unseen rhythm and nothing feels stiff or artificial. That's not saying there aren't a few scenes that are more dynamic then the first movie, because there is, but as a whole if you liked the animation from the first movie you will like it here as well. As far as the characters go everyone is as kooky as they were in the first movie. Adam Sandler's brilliant comedic version of Dracula taking center stage, leading the still funny renditions of classic movie monsters. As Dracula, Sandler is just the right amount of hammy without it being off-putting. Such a performance makes it seem as if the over the top way movie monsters acted in our films was just the \"old way\" of acting for them. The mood and colors used in the movie are a great mix of themes. The moody backdrops with dank dark colors fit the horror movie style the characters in the movie originate from perfectly. Then add some bright colors to mimic the happy comedic tone of the movie. Combining this together you have a brilliant mix of happy and spooky that made both the first movie and this one enjoyable for everyone. When it comes down to it Hotel Transylvania 2 is a heartwarming family movie full of comedy that everyone, whether you're big or small, can enjoy.",
         "This movie is definitely very funny. Overall the plot isn't something that is a serious message and IF the audience accepts the fact that they are only going to be getting a funny movie out of Hotel Transylvania, then the experience will be much better. The evolution of Drac's beloved hotel is apparent in this movie. When his grandson enters the setting this changes the dynamic of the movie making it more interesting. The animation in this film is nonetheless, absolutely incredible. I have to hand it to the animation design crew, because in that regard, this movie was something special. The introduction was a little sped up, and the movie itself moves very fast so if you stop to take a pee break, there's a good chance you will definitely get lost in the movie. 9/10 from me. Patrick Clay",
         "Hotel Transylvania 2 The key to dating Dracula's daughter is making sure to always wear a garlic-flavored condom. Unfortunately, the new dad in this animated movie didn't heed that warning. Unsure if his grandson Dennis will turn out to be a monster like his mother (Selena Gomez) or human like his father (Andy Samberg), Count Dracula (Adam Sandler) and his cronies (Steve Buscemi, Keegan-Michael Key, Kevin James, David Spade) take the tyke for the weekend. But when his father (Mel Brooks) shows up unexpectedly, Drac must keep Dennis' mixed bloodline a secret from the old orthodox bloodsucker. The unwarranted sequel to the mediocre original, HT2 does an inadequate job of establishing any time has past with the newfound parents still resembling teenagers. Furthermore, the jokes failed to have mature as well, making for a dismal revisit all-around. Incidentally, the issue of human/monster hybrid fetuses is going to flip the abortion issue on its ear.

         "This is one of those movies that you watch and you just can't help but come out smiling afterwards about. It's so rib ticklingly funny and it really gets you feeling happy. It's seven years after first movie, Jonathan and Mavis get married, have a kid - little Dennis and gramps the Count Dracula wants him to be a half vampire. The Count tries all sorts of things to bring this side out. I will let you watch to see what happens. The characters are just fantastic, especially Count Dracula, Jonothan and Mavis. You also get a chance to see more of Murray's (mummy) , Griffin (invisible man), Frankenstein and Wayne's (werewolf) personalities in this movie. Love them and they really make you smile. Also funny is Blobby - a green jelly mould. He's so sweet don't know why he's scary but who cares. Loved Jonathan's in laws in this too! The human intake had a great side and the little boy Dennis plus girl werewolf Winnie was a brilliant cute factor. The vampire camp and tower scene is just without doubt brilliant to see. It's got a few scary moments with red eyes and teeth coming at the screen which may scare kids if they are jumpy but otherwise the music and look of the film is spectacular. Loved the flying together moment with Count and Mavis. Such a tender fun father daughter time. I just can't recommend this movie enough but go and see it - It's funny, touching, scary in parts and will leave you smiling for hours. Great for anyone whether young or old",
         "This animated movie directed by Genndy Tartakosky is truly hilarious and left the audience and me laughing out loud. If you didn't enjoy the original Hotel Transylvania very much, give this sequel another try because I truly believe this movie is much better than the original. By far my favorite character is Dracula (Adam Sandler), because he is such a special character. He is so loving, forgiving and maybe just a little crazy sometimes. This movie makes me want to have a grandfather like him because he is so powerful and loving. A continuous joke is Dracula trying to get used to his cell phone. His fingernails are too long to type with so he is always frustrated with this new technology. The relationship between Dracula and his daughter, Mavis (Selena Gomez) is so beautiful and memorable. With very exciting news, Mavis is pregnant! It's a boy! The strong bond between baby Dennis and his \"Vampa\" (vampire grandpa) Dracula, is my absolute favorite relationship through this whole movie because their love is so strong even though it is hard for Dracula to accept that his grandson is half human. Dracula is concerned that his grandson hasn't indicated that he is going to be a vampire, so he takes five of his hotel friends to try to scare the fangs out of Dennis. They go on this ridiculous adventure to do whatever it takes to get Dennis's fangs showing. Will Dennis be more like his mother who is a vampire, or stay a human like his father? Adam Sandler puts his own spin on this movie. As co-writer of the screenplay, his goofy short songs pop up throughout the movie. Not only are the song lyrics funny, but they are also relatable and entertaining for the audience because he takes commonly known songs such as twinkle twinkle and alters the words to be slightly inappropriate and silly. The special effects are outstanding and I enjoyed all of the different things they do with the animation. I watched this film in 3D and loved how it makes the characters and settings pop and makes each setting special. In the scene where Dracula leads Dennis and some other monster guests on a crazy adventure, there are so many special effects that it becomes total chaos. The message of this film is that no matter how different someone else is, they could be the best thing that ever happens to you, so love them no matter how different they are. This film really makes me realize how crucial to accept others. The character Blobby, a gelatinous blob, is definitely a crowd pleaser and the younger audiences laughed out loud at his silly antics. The target audience for Hotel Transylvania 2 is anyone who wants to laugh and have a good time. I recommend this movie for ages 5 to 18 because some of the scenes might be a little scary for some young children. I recommend seeing this movie in 3D as well because it is a very cool experience and give it 5 out of 5 stars because this movie is truly hilarious. Reviewed by Lainey A., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.",
         "This sequel to the 2012 original film is indeed a monster mash, but it's not a graveyard smash for the most part. Still, the animation film is still watchable for a family friendly flick for the Halloween season. Once again, directed by fame animator, Genndy Tartakovsky, Hotel Transylvania 2 tells the story of Dracula (Voiced by Adam Sandler), who has since, been more open-minded with his relationship with human beings, since the last movie. While things are going great on the business side, Dracula is still worried about his family, mostly about his half-vampire, half-human grandson Dennis (Voiced by Asher Blinkoff), because he isn't showing any signs of being a vampire. Since, Dennis hasn't show any signs to be immortal, Dracula's adult daughter, Mavis (Voiced by Selena Gomez) believes that the castle might not to be the best place to raise a human child, so she wants to visits her in-laws place in California with her husband Jonathan (Voiced by Andy Sanberg) to see if that's a good place to relocate. Fearing he'll lose his daughter and grandson, forever, Dracula must tries to push Dennis to his limits, in hope to get his inner monster, out, so Mavis will change her mind. Will Dracula be successful with his attempts or will Dracula have to learn to adapt, that his daughter is all grown up and ready to leave the nest? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, this movie was somewhat disappointing. Yes, it clearly have some positive messages about family unity, tolerance and diversity that children could learn from; but sadly, this animated comedy also lacks the emotional heart, social commentary and funny humor, that really shine in the first movie. The whole deus ex machina ending with Dracula's own father, Vlad (Voiced by Mel Brooks) was very anticlimax and really comes out of nowhere. Mel Brooks was so misused in this. I wish, he had more screen time, than he got. Honestly, the lack of screen time, kinda hurts his bad guy turn good guy role. It wasn't believable, when he does it. How does a prejudiced vampire father, who isn't tolerant of humans, changes his views, he's had of humans for hundreds if not thousands of years in roughly two minutes, because his great-grandson is half-human. Come on, movie! The whole diversity issue between monsters & humans from the first movie was somewhat, the best thing about the first film. I felt that it was really lacking here. I was really hoping, more 1967's Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, type of smart humor with Vlad. Honestly, Hotel Transylvania 2 would be, a stronger movie, if it didn't cop out; because it can somewhat relatable to real-life parents. Indeed, one day, your adult children might move out, and make a life of their own. You just have to learn, how to deal with it. It would have been, a very good message for both young & older parents as well as their children. While, the single Tex Avery-influenced animated motion is beautifully well-made & will surely amuse the younger children. Having that message would make this film, so much better. It would had brought back the emotional impact that I love from the first film, between Dracula & Mavis. Another problem about the film, is the lack of the Hotel settling. Yes, most of it, is still placed in Transylvania, but for a film call Hotel Transylvania 2, it really has nothing to do with the hotel, this time. I would love, if the movie add a sub-plot of Dracula trying to have Mavis, be his heir to the family business and forcing her to choose between turning Jonathan & Dennis into immortal vampires by biting them, or to leave them as mortal humans. It would make a more-well-rounded in-depth film. Regards of what ifs, the movie as a whole was entertaining. Some of the humor was funny, but most of it, was meh. I really, could do, without those clean-cut 'Family Guy' style, humorous cut scenes & outlandish pop culture songs interrupts. They really fall flat. Adam Sandler once again, works great as Dracula. You can tell, that he really loves, playing this role. After all, Sandler signed up, for the original film, just to make a movie that, he and his daughter, Sadie can watch, together. You really can tell that Sandler cut down on his man-child toilet-base shtick, just to make this kid-targeted humor film, work. For the most part, it kinda does. Once again, Sandler's film buddies: Kevin James, Steve Buscemi & David Spade, are able to find work, because of his influence in production. The only different, this time, is that Keegan-Michael Key, replacing CeeLo Green as Murray the Mummy, due to previous actor/singer Ceelo Green being arrested, during film production in 2014. In my opinion, Keegan-Michael Key is a lot funnier than CeeLo Green, ever was, in this role. For the rest of the roles, Selena Gomez and Andy Sanberg are still wonderful. I do love their funny sub-story adventure in California. To the film credit, Hotel Transylvania 2 does takes the characters in some new and interesting directions, that I didn't see coming. I do like the odd, sly nods and allusions to old horror movies, with a slight mixer with 21 century technology humor and social media references. While, the necrophilia overtones can be somewhat gross & jarring when thinking too deep about it. The only thing, I really hated about the film, is how it kinda insults 1931's Dracula, by naming the bad guy in the film, Bela. That was really offensive to the fan-based. Overall: While, Hotel Transylvania 2, doesn't reach the same heights as its predecessor, it still somewhat top-notch. A great Halloween treat, worth trick or treating.",
         "The scenario of this animation could be written on the back of a beer mat,so what do you do when you have almost no story to tell ? Quite simple, action films in the same situation tend to add a lot of special effects, but that does not really apply to animation so you just overload the film by speeding up the animations expecting that the result will be funny. Unfortunately fast animation is not synonymous with gags and in this film the gags are lame and repetitive, for instance how many times have we got to see the blob character to absorb somebody ? The first time you may smile but as it is repeated at least three times it looks like they are just filling up. They have a go at jokes when for instance a monster sniffs the mother of - I think Johnny - the monster says \"you smell funny\" the mother replies \"It is called DEODORANT\" and she adds \"He must be European\" the joke being Europeans don't wash and smell bad. It is just insulting and not funny, this is just a crass attempt at a joke.So this film is a nice but empty and not funny animation.Avoid.",
         "A sequel to Hotel Transylvania, Hotel Transylvania 2 begins with a slow zoom-in on the castle itself. Everything is being thrown around and put together for Jonathan (human) and Mavis's (vampire) wedding. All that matters to Dracula is that his daughter is happy at the hotel that use to only allow monsters to stay, until Jonathan found it in the first movie. Time passes and great news about a baby in the Dracula family is to be born by Mavis. Excited and motivated, Dracula is determined to see Dennis, the baby boy, become a great vampire and carry the legacy of Dracula. The main problem was Dennis didn't have fangs when he was born and he had until five years old to grow them in so he could stay at Hotel Transylvania, because Mavis wanted a human to get human interaction. She thought it wasn't safe with all the monsters around. The story itself is amusing and fun for kids who are into the social world and know the traditional stories of monsters such as: Frankenstein, Dracula, Werewolf, Invisible Man, Mummy and other monsters. An example of the social world being incorporated into the monster world was the desk clerk monsters for the hotel were playing with a picture app on a phone that allows you to disfigure your face or body. Jonathan was innovating the hotel by getting monsters connected through computers and phones since they were now allowing humans to stay at the hotel. There were instances where humans were interacting with the monsters with no problem. For instance, Dracula was taking Dennis out so he could scare the fangs into him at Dark Forest Municipal Park, a place crawling with humans just walking, jogging, or with their pets. Frankenstein tried to scare two girls that were jogging and they flipped out, because it was the popular Frankenstein and they wanted a picture with him. Four-year-old Dennis jumped out right after and said \"boo,\" but only got a pat on the head instead of frightening girls. Dracula was also asked by a man driving a car where him and the girl in the passenger seat could get a \"bite\" to eat, not thinking that it was a blood drinking vampire. Werewolf, or Wayne, was directed to kill something in the forest for food but didn't want to because there were pop tarts now. I'm a fan of animated films and comedy, which the film did well in both. A lot of the scenes incorporated humans and monsters and showed how the dialogue between both was funny. For example, Dracula's new phone given by Jonathan has a GPS with a deep vampire voice. A scene also showed how great Invisible man was at teaching his workout class. The sleeping lullaby that was sung by Dracula was \"suffer, suffer, scream and shout,\" showed an example of the difference in a human lullaby and Dracula's. A lot of cool effects were part of the movie as well since there were monsters. For instance, Dracula could change into a bat and have powers to freeze people or change objects. Another cool effect was showing the pack of werewolves, made by Wayne and his wife Wanda, become a wave that swept through the birthday party decorations and shaving anyone in their way from hip down. Also, Dracula's dad coming to Dennis's fifth birthday party showed nice effects by changing the human in a monster suit to a scary monster with sharp teeth and muscles popping onto the body to scare the fangs out of Dennis. However, everyone's attempt to scare the fangs into Dennis did not work. Dracula's dad's vampire minion hurting Winnie, werewolf girl that Dennis liked, made Dennis's fangs come out. It was followed by a fight between the Hotel Transylvania family and the bundle of vampire minions being crushed. In this fight alone, you get to witness Dennis showing his strength, his bat flying skills, and his ability to freeze people. In the end, scaring the fangs out of Dennis didn't work. Instead, Dennis's want to protect Winnie brought out his fangs. Dracula was so obsessed with Dennis becoming a vampire that he almost forgot he didn't care if Dennis was going to be a human, a vampire, or a unicorn. Regardless of what Dennis became, Dracula would adore and love his grandchild. The grandpa vampire, Vlad, was originally a vampire conservative type of guy but ended up changing his ways and stopping his vampire minion from killing Jonathan. The movie ended in a great way by connecting all the family members together, Jonathan's human family and Dracula's monster family. The only thing I think the movie could improve on was the jumping back and forth of scenes. When Mavis went with Jonathan to visit his family in Santa Cruz, California, it seemed like their stay was brief and the scenes lasted longer than it should have since the focus was on Dennis getting his fangs. I can see why they were sent off though, because it was part of the plan to get the protective mom, Mavis, away so the scaring could happen. Overall the incorporation of humans and monsters comfortably in each scene was great and made the movie enjoyable and family friendly. Some of the animated character's voices were played by Adam Sandler (Dracula), Andy Samberg (Jonathan), Mavis (Selena Gomez), Frankenstein (Kevin James), Werewolf Wayne (Steve Buscemi), Invisible Man Griffin (David Spade), and Mummy Murray (Keegan- Michael Key). The director of Hotel Transylvania 2 is Genndy Tartakovsky and writing credit were given to Adam Sandler and Robert Smigel. I can see why the comedy came so easily since Adam Sandler was in it, and he had some characters who are in a lot of his other movies as well such as Grown Ups and Just Go with It (\"Biography,\" IMDb.com). Since the movie was animated, the monsters and their facial expressions made the jokes come to life.",
         "Today myself,mom and my younger brother were lucky to have seen the preview of this movie before its worldwide release on Friday 16th of October. Hotel Transylvania 2 is the sequel and follow up to the 2012 film of the same name where Dracula this time has made his hotel a welcoming place for humans to stay at. This time around and Mavis and Johnny(voiced by Selena Gomez from Wizards Of Waverly Place and Andy Samberg from That's My Boy)are now married and have a son called Dennis. But Dracula(voiced by Adam Sandler)is happy that Dennis is a human and doesn't care who he is as long as Mavis and Johnny have a healthy boy. Meanwhile Mavis and Johnny take a trip to California for a few days without Dennis and of course this causes some problems along the way as Dracula and his crew are desperate to make Dennis a vampire. So is Dennis a vampire waiting to get his fangs or is he a normal little boy like his father Johnny? Good: The animation in this is just as good as the original film its dark and slightly colourful at the same time. The humor is very good as well as the voice acting and Adam Sandler for me is better at doing voice over work now than his live action films which are how shall I put it boring and crap. So if I were Sandler i'd stick to animation for now on. As for the rest they are all good too. Also I like how the guy that voices the mummy sounds exactly like Cee-Lo Green(as he wasn't available to do the sequel). The music is good as Fifth Harmony's Worth It and the title song I'm In Love With A Monster are great songs but I do prefer Becky G's Monster remix a bit better though to be honest with ya. Bad: Is it me or does this movie feel like a parody of Twilight human falling for a vampire,human has a child who maybe a vampire or not etc. But still though this was very funny and I was glad to have seen this film today. 7/10 Very good for the kiddies and for those who are die-had fans of horror films(I don't like horror films but surprise surprise I liked this one. Also legendary voice over actor Mel Brooks is in this as Dracula's dad Vlad and of course Dana Carvey from that god awful film Master Of Disguise makes a cameo as Dana the co-coordinator for the vampire camp.",
         "When I first heard about Hotel Transylvania 2, I was so exited for this movie, since the first one was a blast. Well it's good, very good (but not exactly)... The film saw us a huge \"evolution\" of Drac's beloved hotel. Now accepting humans, use gadgets and so on. Than his grandson came, The adorable Dennis. With Mavis and Jhonny went to where Jhonny grew up, Drac tries to make Dennis grow his fangs. And that's where the chaos begin The whole film was very entertaining. Adam Sandler's performance as Dracula is so entertaining, plus he make most of the jokes extremely funny. Than there's his friends: A Frankenstein, a invincible man, a mummy, a werewolf(?) and the laugh maker blob. All of his friends make a fantastic combination of absolute laughter. Plus Dennis relationship with other monsters is adorable and heartwarming Now i want to talk some bad things: The film couldn't make a more interesting plot. I always wondering why it starts with Drac's fathers visit, A fight between a group of evil vampires, they won and it's done. It's plot is to short and so simple. The film is also quite short. for about 86 minutes, it seems the film doesn't like long stories, it's to short for me. Overall, the film gives a great combination of friendship, cheerful tone, and a great pack of laughter. Looks like the Drac pack they promise were not a disappointment FINAL SCORE: 7/10"

         "The Drac pack is back for an all-new monster comedy adventure in Sony Pictures Animation's Hotel Transylvania 2! Everything seems to be changing for the better at Hotel Transylvania... Dracula's rigid monster-only hotel policy has finally relaxed, opening up its doors to human guests. But behind closed coffins, Drac is worried that his adorable half-human, half-vampire grandson, Dennis, isn't showing signs of being a vampire. So while Mavis is busy visiting her human in-laws with Johnny - and in for a major cultural shock of her own - \"Vampa\" Drac enlists his friends Frank, Murray, Wayne and Griffin to put Dennis through a \"monster-in-training\" boot camp. But little do they know that Drac's grumpy and very old, old, old school dad Vlad is about to pay a family visit to the hotel. And when Vlad finds out that his great-grandson is not a pure blood - and humans are now welcome at Hotel Transylvania - things are going to get batty!",
         "It's been three years since we last saw the Drac Pack, and now they're back in the all-new sequel to the 2012 original hit comedy. After getting married, Johnny and Mavis are happy together, but seven years later, a new arrival becomes part of the family: a half-human/half-vampire baby boy called Dennis (Denisovitch in Transylvanian). Unfortunately, due to the dangerous environment, the worried new mom suggests that Dennis would be safer in Johnny's hometown of California, as Drac believes his grandson may never develop vampire powers by his fifth birthday. And to make things far worse, an impromptus visit from Dracula's very, very old human-hating father, Vlad causes things to get a little \"out of claw\".",
         "Mavis and Johnny get married to each other and are happily living in Hotel Transylvania. Soon Mavis is pregnant and gives birth to the boy Dennis. When he is five years old, his fangs have not grown and Mavis thinks to move to California with Johnny and Dennis to give a chance to the boy to be raised among humans. Dracula asks Johnny to travel with Mavis to the house of his parents in California and convinces her to stay at the hotel. Meanwhile Dracula joins his friends Frank, Wayne, Griffin, Murray and Blobby the Blob and they travel with Dennis to a vampire camp to teach the boy to turn into a vampire so that Mavis and Johnny stay at the hotel. However neither the boy transforms nor his fangs grew. Meanwhile Mavis is delighted with the facilities in supermarket in California and she is sure that moving to California would be the best for her son. What will be Mavis' final decision?",
