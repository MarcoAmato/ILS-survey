      "synopsis": "Wayne's World 2, while retaining Wayne Campbell, Garth Algar, and Wayne's girlfriend Cassandra Wong, has a much more serious tone and outcome than the first Wayne's World movie. The movie opens with Wayne explaining that the course of the 'past year,' in this case the year between the two movies, has seen a lot of changes in his life. Although he still hosts his television show Wayne's World, he now lives in an apartment building which was once a doll factory. He is very proud of the fact that Cassandra's carrer is taking off and they are still very involved with each other, but talks about how people are telling him he needs to find focus in his life and 'grow up.' In a dream, Wayne sees singer Jim Morrison, who tells Wayne to put on a music festival in Aurora, Illinois. The festival itself makes Wayne go through the process of booking bands and getting permits for the event, although the event itself isn't truly the core to the story. The festival takes a back seat to Wayne's romance with Cassandra, who he comes to acknowledge he truly loves and wonders about their future together. Wayne, about half way through the film, has to prove himself to Mister Wong, Cassandra's father. In a satire of classic Kung Fu movies, Wayne and Mister Wong battle each other while dubbing themselves. Wayne proves himself to be a worthy warrior, but does not earn the complete respect of Mister Wong. Cassandra's carrer now centers around her producer, Bobby Kahn, played by actor Christpher Walken. Wayne is suspiscious of Cassandra and Bobby's relationship together, as it becomes obvious to Wayne that it sees that where ever Cassandra is Bobby is also. Wayne spies on Cassandra and later confronts her about what he witnessed, causing her to punch him in the face and seeminly ending their relationship. Wayne struggles with this throughout the rest of the movie, wanting to make peace with Cassandra and win her back. Wayne later discovers that Cassandra is about to be wed to Bobby, forcing Wayne to abandon his post on the day of his festival to stop the wedding and pronounce his love for Cassandra. At the very last minute, he interupts the wedding ceremony of Cassandra and Bobby, where he then discovers that Mister Wong had set up the wedding to gain his green card. Wayne and Cassandra then return to Wayne's music festival where she performs and Aerosmith arrives shortly thereafter. The movie ends immediately after the festival, leaving the viewer to believe that Wayne has finally 'grown up' into an 'adult' now that he has not only confirmed his love for Cassandra but managed to organize and run a music festival without forgetting what it means to 'have fun.' Garth becomes involved with a seemingly older woman in Wayne's World 2, who he later discovers is married and hisentiore relatinship with the woman was a sham to get back at her husband, who she wants dead. Garth's character hasn't seem to have grown or changed much from the first Wayne's World movie, however by the end of Wayne's World 2 it appears as if he has matured emotionally to where Wayne's character was at the end of the first Wayne's World movie, although his character and his problems never appear to have found resolution by the end of Wayne's World 2.",

         "In 1992 we were given the comedy classic, Wayne's World, it was stupid, immature, and silly, but it's what we needed for a great laugh. Mike Myers comes up with a lot of creative characters and he hit the nail in the head with Wayne Campbell and Garth Algar. After the huge success of Wayne's World, it was pretty obvious that they could go for another round. Unfortunately Wayne's World 2 wasn't as big of a splash as the original, but it still made me laugh so hard. As stupid as it was and some of the jokes were a little recycled, I still had such a great time watching this movie. It's silly and over the top, but how could you not have fun with Wayne and Garth? This is a fun sequel that should be given a fair chance. Wayne and Garth are a year older and everything has stayed basically the same, except Wayne has moved out of his parents' house and lives with Garth in an abandoned factory loft in Chicago. Wayne has a dream where he meets Jim Morrison and a weird naked Indian, in which Morrison tells Wayne that his destiny is to organize and put on a big concert. Cassandra, meanwhile, spends a lot of time out of town where she is working with record producer Mr. Big on recording music. Her new producer, Bobby Cahn, slowly tries to seduce her away from Wayne. After Wayne admits that he was spying on her, Cassandra breaks off the relationship and hastily gets engaged to Bobby on the rebound. Garth meets a beautiful woman, Honey Hornee, at the laundromat, and she quickly ropes him in with her charms. Wayne and Garth re-enter Wayne's previous dream and meet Jim Morrison again. They decide to go for one more try and make \"Waynestock\" a success, get Cassandra back, and see if Garth can find real love since his new girl is kinda homicidal. Honestly if someone asked me if Wayne's World 2 is worth the watch, I'd definitely say yes. This is always guaranteed a good laugh, just Garth's story alone with Kim Bassinger as Honey Hornee is worth the look. I also love the scene where the guys end up in a gay bar and end up singing \"Y.M.C.A.\" song, I nearly died laughing. Also Christopher Walken is in this movie, what more do you need to watch a movie? Christopher was such a great addition to the characters and made a great villain. It was great to see all the characters back together and this was a fun sequel, so if you need a good laugh, don't hold back, this is a movie that is sure to tickle you're funny bone. 7/10",
         "The crew of \"Wayne's World 2\" had a nearly impossible task of following up the amazingly successful \"Wayne's World\". Needless to say, this does not compare to the original. However, this film is pretty good. Myers and Carvey are back with just as much wit and splendid timing as the original. This time they are opposed by the brilliance of Christopher Walken who, as usual, plays his part to a tee. The plot of setting up a festival does not have the power of that of the original and I was not crazy with the Jim Morrison character. The amount of cameos was a bit too extreme at time as what seemed like every other shot had some other famous person wanting to be part of the film. You would think that a film like this would not be as good hearted as it is, but it really is just a good film on so many levels. It's not a must see like it's predecessor, but I would still recommend it to anyone.",
         "One of the biggest hits of 1992, the original WAYNE'S WORLD is a definite classic and is one of the funniest movies of 1990's, but I am not a big fan of sequels so I tried to avoid watching WAYNE'S WORLD 2 for a while. Eventually, I finally got around to watching WAYNE'S WORLD 2 and found it to be surprisingly better than the original. Part of the reason the movie succeeds is because it has one of the greatest casts in movie history with appearances by Christopher Walken, Heather Locklear, Bob Odenkirk, Robert Smigel, Kevin Pollak, Kim Basinger, Chris Farley, Drew Barrymore, Ted McGinley, Tim Meadows, Jay Leno, Charlton Heston, Ed O'Neill, and Aerosmith. I'm not saying that a good cast automatically makes a movie great, but in this case, it certainly helps. The gags in WAYNE'S WORLD 2 are definitely more random and bizarre than the ones in the original, making it even more fun than I expected it to be. Some of these random jokes don't work as well as they should, though overall it's still a hilarious movie that is good to watch with your friends. ***1/2",
         "This is a good sequel to the original film. The part that stands out in this that i loved is when Wayne and Cassandra's father fight. I have always loved martial arts movie spoofs and this is funny. From the impossible kicks to the poorly dubbed voice of Cassandra's father. All the other characters from the original reunite for this good sequel. It will have u in stiches.",
         "I think this movie is pretty underrated. I think it was just as funny as the first one the movie was very funny. Every scene from the Village People spoof to the scenes with Jim Morrisson and the naked indian to anything involving Garth and Honey Hornee(bodacious Kim Basinger) and the scene were Wayne fights with Cassandra's father(the movie's highlight) were just hilarious. I found this to be a most excellent sequel and I'm just hoping that Mike Myers someday makes a third one he probably won't do that now since he is milking Austin Powers to death. Anyhow this is one of the better SNL based movies out there along with the first \"Wayne's World\",\"Coneheads\" and \"The Blues Brothers\" and I reccomend it to anyone looking for a good laugh.",
         "I thought Wayne's World 2 was much funnier than the first one. The jokes are much better as is the storyline which is unusual for a sequel. I think this is one of Mike Myers best ever films and probably the funniest he's ever been in. The great thing is, you don't even have to watch the first film to understand what goes on in the second film either. A fantastic film full of great jokes and if you don't laugh, you can't be human.",
         "In general, sequels tend not to be such a good idea. There are many examples where a sequel has been utter rubbish and it is rare that a sequel can match up to its original, even if it is a good film. However, every so often a sequel comes along that can match its counterpart and even have some better points. Wayne's World 2 is a prime example of this. Mike Myers and Dana Carvey are back as Wayne and Garth and this time the embark on a quest to stage a concert in Aurora after Wayne is visited in dream by an all time great of the music world. Another strong plot and some great new characters to go with the originals make this film very watchable and there are possible even more laugh out loud funny moments than before. A very good, funny film that does justice to the great original",
         "but like the original this movie doesn't have much laughs,but once again the characters make the movie fun. i iike this one about the same as the original,but for some reason i watch this movie a lot more than the original. i guess maybe more memorable scenes than the first one,im not sure. both wayne's world movies could be even better if they had more laughs,but like i said the characters make it fun,and watchable. both plots for the two wayne's world movies are not as dumb as the plots in the two austin powers movies. but both austin powers movies had a lot more laughs. but the wayne's world movies are still fun. i give wayne's world 2 **1/2 out of ****",
         "I recently bought this film, I'm a long time fan of Waynes World 1 and 2. Bit disappointed that the DVD didn't have any extras but i can settle for just owning this film. My favourite parts of the film are the parts with Jim Morrison (mainly because I'm a huge fan of The Doors). Wayne: \"Who are you?\" Jim: \"Im Jim Morrison\" Wayne: \"Who's he?\" Jim: \"..A weird naked Indian\" Wayne: \"Cool\" Also i like the bit when Dell Preston is showing the groupies the machine gun turrets on the stage model. Funny and exciting this is one of the very few sequels i like. recommended to any fan of Mike Myers work.",
         "I first saw Wayne's World in the theater when I was around 15 or so. It's impact on kids during that time rivaled things like the NES, Beavis & Butthead & Nike Air Jordan's. I think many people, several years older or younger than myself could see both movies back to back and love them equally. Everyone sees things differently for their own perspective. For about a year after the release of Wayne's World, I'd heard practically every single line from that movie repeated in conversation, multiple times at one point or another. The references to that movie were used so frequently, it was almost becoming a new language spoken by everyone under 20. Then, it became much like a really eccentric person you befriend who quickly goes from being interesting -- to just plain annoying... By the time Wayne's World 2 was released, the quirky, spontaneous, \"feel good\" personality that everyone loved about the first one, was basically absent and the gimmick was totally worn out. It's extremely hard to put into words, but the first one just had a fun, hilarious, intimate feel about it that people could relate to. By Wayne's World 2; Wayne, Garth, and even Wayne's girlfriend had all gone in different directions and it lost the fun, friendly, \"party\" feel to it. The spontaneous nature of the jokes were gone and everything felt scripted. It was no longer \"fun\" to watch, but rather -- tedious. In my opinion, the pop culture icon known as Wayne's World, marked the end of the fun, good times, partying and close friendships of the '80s. Wayne's World 2 marked the beginning of the stale, rehashed, lazy & alienated '90s. As most people realize, the generation/era that was the '80s (and everything that made it iconic) didn't end on Dec, 31 1989. Just as every other generation, it carried on for a few more years into the beginning of the next decade. I've never found a better example to demonstrate the end of one generation and the beginning of another as I have by watching Wayne's World & Wayne's World 2. At least from my perspective..."
