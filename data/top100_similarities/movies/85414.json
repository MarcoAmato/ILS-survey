      "synopsis": "A man (Jake Gyllenhaal) wakes up on a train sitting across from a woman named Christina Warren (Michelle Monaghan). The woman knows him by the name Sean Fentress, but he doesn't seem to know her and appears uncertain of his own identity. After eight minutes, a bomb goes off on the train, and the man awakens to find himself strapped inside a small geodesic dome. There, Air Force Capt. Colleen Goodwin (Vera Farmiga) explains to him through a computer screen that he is actually Colter Stevens, a decorated army helicopter pilot, now on a mission to locate the maker of a bomb which destroyed a train headed into Chicago. This is to be accomplished using the Source Code, a time loop program that allows him to take over someone's body in a reenactment of their last eight minutes of life. Stevens has no memory of how he became involved in the Source Code project; his last memory is of flying in a recent mission in Afghanistan while taking on enemy gunfire. Stevens's mission in the Source Code is to assume the identity of Fentress, one of the train's passengers, locate the bomb, discover who detonated it, and report back to Goodwin to prevent the bomber from detonating a larger dirty nuclear device in downtown Chicago, which could cause the deaths of millions of people. Goodwin and the Source Code's creator, Dr. Rutledge (Jeffrey Wright), tell him that the Source Code is not a simulation, but a visit into the past in the form of an alternate reality. He's told that he cannot truly alter the past to save any of the passengers, but that he must gather intel that can be used to alter the future and prevent a future attack. Goodwin assures Stevens that \"everything will be OK.\" Stevens is sent into the Source Code repeatedly, and each time a series of events repeat, with variations due to Stevens's acts. Meanwhile, he goes on searching for the terrorist and getting to know Christina, until the bomb that destroys the train goes off and Fentress dies, sending Stevens back to the chamber. Even though Rutledge and Goodwin constantly direct him to focus on finding the bomber, each time around he learns more, both about the terrorist attack and his real life personal situation. Stevens resolves to complete his mission, now with the added personal goal of saving Christina and the people on the train if at all possible. Using a cellphone while on the train, Stevens eventually discovers that he supposedly died two months ago. He confronts Goodwin with this information, and learns from Goodwin and Rutledge that he had been shot down during the war, and his mutilated body was appropriated by the Air Force and used by Rutledge to operate the Source Code. Stevens then asks Rutledge and Goodwin to let him die, which they promise they will do once the mission is finished. He eventually discovers that the bomber is a disturbed American young man named Derek Frost (Michael Arden), which allows authorities to apprehend Frost and save Chicago before the second bomb is detonated. With the mission accomplished, and despite their promise, Rutledge orders Stevens's memory to be erased and stored for reuse in further missions. However, Stevens persuades Goodwin to send him in one more time and give him one last chance to avert the train disaster. Goodwin agrees that he deserves to be allowed to die in peace afterwards instead of being held alive as a military brain in a vat. With the information he has uncovered from previous trips into the Source Code, Stevens is able to defuse the bomb and immobilize Frost before he can destroy the train. Stevens and Christina kiss in the last seconds before the eight-minute mark. In that instant, Goodwin turns off his life support per his request, but to Stevens's surprise, his mind remains in Sean Fentress's body. He is then able to safely leave the train with Christina, also saving the rest of the passengers. Now in the alternate universe, an alternate version of Goodwin receives an email from Stevens explaining what has happened and that the Source Code can alter the target alternate reality. The movie ends with Stevens taking Fentress's place, and asking Goodwin to help Captain Colter Stevens and tell him that \"everything will be OK.\", which Goodwin had told Stevens earlier in the film.",

         "I have to agree with the previous reviewer. This is the best thriller I've seen in years. Definitely kept me on the edge of my seat. The writing is outstanding. All four principal actors do well and Gyllenhaal, especially, carries the plot forward extremely well. At the start, I feared a stock, predictable Hollywood thriller. But soon I found myself en wrapped in Gyllenhaal's puzzle-within-a puzzle. At the end, the Industry audience for this screening erupted in spontaneous applause. Duncan Jones is definitely a young director to watch. If you like thrillers, go see this film!",
         "I was very fortunate to be at the World Premiere at SXSW in Austin and attended the Q&A after with James Duncan, Vera Farmiga, Michelle Monaghan, Jake Gyllenhaal and Ben Ripley. The story line keeps you on the edge of your seat and adds in enough humor to make it a thoroughly enjoyable experience. There is amazing, subtle chemistry between Jake and Michelle which really is the star of the film, performances by all the actors are excellent. Beautiful cinematography that will make Chicago proud. The ending brings up more questions than answers, but it feels right, so that's OK with me. I am not a big sci-fi fan, but this film delivers on romance, suspense, mystery and thrills. Highly recommended.",
         "My first glance, I thought it's gonna be an ordinary action movie. The guy will look for the bomber, He'll find the bomber, he wants to save the girl, Eventually he saves the girl. But the movie isn't like that. The movie ends up having mysteries with unpredictably smart revelations. It's not an action blockbuster cookie cutter. It's a unique kind of movie that intrigues the whole cinema and let us enjoy the ride in a new way. \"Source Code\" is not a clichéd mediocre action blockbuster. The movie avoids being predictable and wants to be smart and mind-bending. Duncan Jones isn't the kind of director who cares about the action. By the way this is his first action movie but he's smart for not making super cool unrealistic action scenes. He cares about the story. The movie have many intriguing subplots that is not easy to figure out. The movie wanted to be as smart as possible. The performances were great. Jake Gyllenhaal made the whole game exciting. Michelle Monaghan shows her role's innocence. Vera Farmiga is obviously good in here. Jeffery Wright is the best among the four. The rest of the filmmaking, Chris Bacon's music score sounds old fashion and I liked it. The effects isn't really that great but it doesn't matter. The script is indeed smart. The movie also has a heart. \"Source Code\" is as good as \"Limitless\". Both of them had the same reason why is it good. It's smart, intriguing(I've said this word many times in this review), and indeed original. Most action movies these days wanted to be super cool and super loud. \"Source Code\" doesn't really have a big action but it's more fun, made more sense and it's super smart.",
         "What a movie. The price is worth paying. This movie gets straight to the point. You know you see a lot of movies that waste so much time getting into a story. Not this film, virtually from the off, we are there, in the film. It's like there is no beginning, but a middle and an end. Obviously you guys know the storyline so I'll not waste time telling you what it is about, just go and see it. It is a film that keeps you looking, you actually feel like you are 'in the source code' which is fantastic. The only downside to this film is that it feels short, it was 93 minutes but it simply flies by. Maybe that is a good thing? Shows how good this film was! GO CHECK IT OUT!",
         "The future of movies doesn't seem too bright since all we're getting are remakes, adaptations and unnecessary prequels/sequels and that's why original stuff like SOURCE CODE can really make my day. Honestly, the trailers and initial premise didn't seem promising; some soldier can travel back in time and has to stop an some evil terrorist from bombing America. At first glance it looked more like some patriotic Steven Segal movie written by Tom Clancy with a higher budget and better actors. And then you watch it. Like INCEPTION, this is one of the few movies that you can't spoil since even the smallest detail could accidentally reveal a twist or two. The story itself is a very original blend of thriller, sci-fi and drama and it works. Full of unseen twists and with a high octane pacing, SOURCE CODE will keep you wanting for more as each answer is slowly revealed. The script helps too but its the actors, who deliver the lines well, who drive the movie into emotional levels. My only problem with the film is some weak foreshadowing but it thankfully doesn't affect the movie in a bad way and to give any more details would spoil the film. To keep it short and to avoid accidentally spoiling a plot detail or two, SOURCE CODE is a must watch. It's one of the few original films out there in a market full of crap and it's definitely worth your money. It's just a pity that Hollywood doesn't seem to be supporting these kinds of films.",
         "I happen to see this picture yesterday, with a friend of mine, and liked it quite a bit. But it illustrates an increasing problem with big budgeted movies. Spoilers follow. The movie opens with the hero, an Army helicopter pilot, coming to consciousness on a Chicago commuter train. He's being addressed by a pretty girl as her boyfriend. He has various interactions with other passengers. He has no idea of what's going on. As he's trying to figure out who and where he is, a bomb detonates, killing everyone. He finds himself back in a cell, something like a space capsule. He's informed that he's just been a part of a computer simulation, that the train was blown up that morning, that he's been cybernetically linked with the remnants of one of the victims (let it go, this is science fiction), and that his mission is to ID the bomber and prevent him or her from doing more damage. The simulation repeats and he's off again, a bit wiser, and wiser with every iteration. Now, you don't have to be an experienced science fiction reader (which I am) to figure out that the Army pilot is dead, that these computer people are hooking up his brain to the simulation. Live people don't end up inside computer programs. But this does come as a big surprise to the captain, and to the more naive members of the audience. And it does set up what should have been a really original ending. The hero finally completes the mission, having fallen for the girl along the way. He knows he's dead, and so is she, and all this is virtual reality. He pleads with the sympathetic operator to let him redo the simulation one last time, then let him die - completely. Touched, she agrees, even though the ogre chief of the project wants to 'wipe his memory' and use him again. And what happens in the last iteration is what should have made the movie memorable. Knowing this is his last remnant of consciousness, what he does the last time is make everyone in the train car happy. He's learned a great deal about them the other times through. He bets a comedian (whom he has recognized from television) all the money he has that he can't make everyone on the car laugh. The man takes the bet and proceeds to do just that. As the seconds tick down to the inevitable end, when they'll all be incinerated, he takes the girl in his arms, tells her he loves her, and wants to be with her forever. The frame freezes and pans the whole length of the car, revealing every passenger laughing or in various states of bliss. This is the instant that will see the hero into eternity. Not bad, completely unexpected, and, like the best twists, revealing that the theme of the drama was something completely different than the detective story it seemed to be. It's always nice to be surprised like that. I will confess to having to deal with moist eyes constantly at movies, and this was another occasion. A perfect ending. I reached for my hat, expecting the credits to roll up, and . . . . . . . . it wasn't over. It went on for another 15 minutes, into the most God-awful coda you ever saw, completely obliterating the premises of the story, so bad I am not going to describe it. What goes on? My guess is that when they previewed the movie, they found that the some members of the audience were dismayed that people as cute and likable as Jake Gyllenhall and Michelle Monaghan have to suffer the fate they do. A happy ending required. I think that's what happens, given production costs and promotion costs in the tens of millions. Trusting the better sense of the audience is a thing of the past. Too much sunk cost.",
         "I've been waiting for this movie for 2 years. I loved Duncan Jones' last film/debut Moon. It was worth it. Source Code is the best movie that I've seen so far this year. Source Code stars Jake Gyllenhaal as Captain Colter Stevens, a helicopter pilot for the U.S. Military. He wakes up on a train in the body of a man named Sean Fentress. Across from him is a woman named Christina played by the always wonderful Michelle Monaghan. After a few minutes of being confused as hell BOOM! We start out with a big CG building and it's like AUGGH! Then Helicopters burst into flames and they're like AUGH! BOOM! AUGH! Then motorcycles burst into flames while they jump over these helicopters. An 18 wheeler spins out of control and its all like BROSH! And this huge tanker full of dynamite is like BRAH! BRAHH! In other words the train blew up. Turns out that Colter Stevens is in a computer program called the Source Code which allows him to enter somebody's body for the last 8 minutes of his life. Vera Farmiga and Jeffrey Wright play the people in charge of the Source Code. They are very good in their supporting roles. Stevens' job is quite simple: Find the bomber so the next attack can be prevented. So some might argue that this movie isn't original, but they'd actually be kinda wrong. Yes, this movie features Groundhog's day formula and it's about terrorism. It's been compared to a crapload of movies including ■Groundhog Day ■Inception ■Déjà vu ■12 Monkeys ■Quantum Leap ■The Butterfly Effect ■Memento ■Avatar ■Assasin's Creed ■Vantage Point ■Unstoppable ■Prince of Persia: The sands of time ■Final Destination I haven't seen all of these, but I've seen most of them. Let me say right now that Source Code is not that similar to any of those films. Source Code is great, intelligent, entertaining science fiction. There are many great things to say. First off, the acting is fantastic by everybody. Gyllenhaal is in this movie for nearly every frame and he's great in every scene. This is one of his best performances to date and he's had a lot of good performances. Michelle Monaghan has this innocent charm with her character. Vera Farmiga and the very underrated Jeffrey Wright give very interesting and complex performances as well. This film is a whodunit, and lately a lot of those have had rather obvious answers to who did it. The guilty person and/or persons in this movie is NOT obvious. Not at all. At least not to me. A film like this could have suffered from being repetitive since Gyllenhaal repeats the same 8 minutes over and over again, but each time is significantly different from the last so the film feels fresh throughout. The best thing about the movie though is the human story in it. It's really emotionally connecting especially around the end. Stevens was a very, very likable character who I wanted to succeed. The message is moving. The ending is fascinating. I think too many people are calling it off as a plot hole. Its clearly meant to be open to interpretation, kind of like Inception. Lots of people think that it should have ended 10 minutes earlier, but I thought it had a very strong ending. The movie clocks in at a mere 93 minutes, but every second is great. Sure, a real life Source Code isn't a computer program, but I don't get why so many damn people are complaining about that. Another note is that the trailer is a tiny bit misleading. It makes it seem like the whole movie is about Gyllenhaal trying save Michelle Monaghan in a typical \"save the girl\" formula. It's not. The movie is about Gyllenhaal looking for the bomber and it's entertaining all the way through. Sadly Source Code hasn't done good at the box office. It's too bad, because it deserves a LOT of money. Source Code may not be quite as good as Moon, but it's damn close.",
         "Source code is one of those few action/sci-Fi movies that work effectively without exaggeration or embellishment. When we see Source Code we see the certain resemblance it has with ''Déjà Vu'' with Denzel Washington but Duncan Jones, with his own talent his own style prevent that from happening. Source Code has is own method and approach, which is quite entertaining and enjoyable. This movie is certainly recommended for all the action-junkies because this has all to be a ''Summer Hit'' which confuses me, why hasn't this opened in June or July, it had the potential and the content of an ''Summer'' blockbuster. Jake Gyllenhaal is not your typical action hero, since but he really pulls everything off really well. Michelle Monaghan and Vera Farmiga are both absolutely gorgeous women with talent. On the whole Source Code is pure entertainment at its best.",
         "I was looking forward to seeing \" Source Code \" ever since I saw the 1st trailer, and I was lucky enough to catch it in an advance screening, before it officially released here, and it just exceeded my expectations. this is the type of movies that will keep you interested till the very ending . it's probably the best sci-fi/thriller since Inception ! no big action scenes, no big explosions, no usage of unnecessary CGI, well-written story, solid performance from Mr. Gyllenhaal ( who is now officially one of my favorite actors ) and another hit from my newest favorite filmmaker Duncan Jones. don't miss it !",
         "When i saw this at a preview screening, i was not surprised to find another great film from one of the best sci-fi directors of our time; Duncan Jones, who brought us the instant classic, Moon. Source Code is in part an original movie but bears brief resemblance to Tony Scott's Action/Thriller Deja Vu. Source Code centers itself around Colter Stevens, an AFO soldier who wakes upon a train, not knowing how he got there or why and how people are addressing him as someone else, and soon enough the train explodes, supposedly killing everyone. But Stevens awakes to find himself in a kind of \"machine\" called the Source Code. The whole story is fantastic, with a man (Stevens) having to go back in time and trying to find out who is behind the bombing. With even more praise is the directing, script, and the choice of actors for the roles. Jake Gyllenhaal was perfect in the role of Stevens as Jeffery Wright was for his role as Dr. Rutledge who believes everything has to go his way or the \"mission\" will be ruined. Overall, this is a thriller that is not to be missed. But for those who have seen this as well, i agree that if the ending was different and more powerful, the movie would be an INSTANT science fiction classic, but it falls just short of that. Still one that will be remembered for all time, in my opinion. 9/10 Stars***"

         "Colter Stevens, a US Army helicopter pilot whose last memory is flying in Afghanistan, wakes up on a commuter train. However, he discovers that he has assumed the identity of another man. 8 minutes later, the train explodes and Stevens finds himself in some kind of pod. He then talks to someone named Goodwin, who tells him he has to go back and find out who the bomber is. He is sent back to go through the whole thing again and attempts to find who the bomber is but fails. The bomb goes off and Stevens finds himself in the pod again. He is sent back another time, yet still cannot find out anything. When he returns, he asks what is going on. Goodwin and Rutledge, the scientist in charge, tell him that he is part of a project that can put someone in another person's consciousness during the last 8 minutes of their life. Stevens then asks why he cannot just stop the bomb. He is told that he is not going back in time but placed in the moment so he can find out who the bomber is and if there are any other targets. On the side, Stevens finds himself falling for the woman traveling with him while he is still in the other man's consciousness.",
         "Army Captain Colter Stevens finds himself working on a special program where his consciousness can be inserted into another human being. The only catch is can only be there for 8 minutes at any given time. That morning, a bomb exploded on a commuter train just outside Chicago. He occupies the body of teacher going to work on that train and is confused as to what he is doing or why he is there as his last memory is of flying his helicopter on a combat mission in Afghanistan. Those in charge of the program explain to him that there is a bomb on the train that must locate it. More importantly, he must identify the bomber as another bombing is expected later that day. He is also told however that he cannot change the past and can only gather information. As he develops a liking for his traveling companion Christina, he sets out to test that theory.",
         "A man, believing that he is Captain Colter Stevens, awakens at 07:40 on a commuter train bound for Chicago, feeling agitated as he has no idea how he got there since he believes he should be in Afghanistan in his job as a military helicopter pilot. What's more, he is sitting across from a woman who knows him as teacher Sean Fentress. Looking in a mirror and checking his wallet for ID, he sees that he has indeed assumed Fentress' body. Exactly eight minutes after he woke up and just as the train enters Chicago, a massive bomb explodes on the train killing everyone aboard. Next he knows, he is again Captain Colter Stevens, is strapped into a chair in a capsule, and is communicating via video link to Captain Goodwin, who reminds him that he is working on an experimental project, code named Beleaguered Castle. His current mission is to find the bomb aboard the train so that he can discover the identity of the bomber. He will be sent back to the time he awoke as Sean Fentress again and again only for those eight minutes, each time gathering more information until he discovers the bomber's identity. As he reluctantly works on this mission - reluctant in that he still believes he should be in Afghanistan - he tries to find out the underlying reason for the project, since he will learn that all aboard the train have died and will regardless, and why he was chosen for the project. As he finds out more and more, he has his own missions which may be contrary to what Goodwin and the project's architect, Rutledge, have in mind.",
         "The US Army helicopter pilot Captain Colter Stevens awakes in a commuter train to Chicago in the body of a professor named Sean Fentress, and his last memory is flying in Afghanistan. A woman named Christina Warren talks to him; there are minor incidents in the wagon and eight minutes later, the train blows-up. Captain Stevens wakes up in a coffined in a sort of trunk and is contacted by the military Lieutenant Colleen Goodwin. He learns that he had died in a helicopter crash and now he is inserted in a computer program called Source Code, developed by Dr. Rutledge, which transfers him to the body of a deceased person for the last eight minutes of his life using his after images. He is advised that he can not change the past, since Source Code is not a time machine, but he can reassign time and change the future. He is assigned to return to the train and find who the bomber is to avoid his next terrorist attack in Chicago downtown. Captain Stevens is sent back several times and he and Christina fall in love with each other. He decides to save the train from the explosion despite Dr. Rutledge tells him that that is effort is worthless.",
