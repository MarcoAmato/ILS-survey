He ends up joining with a gang and does drug deals as well as kill people for the reputation of this gang. After many years he is sent on parole that\u2019s when his gang leader gives him a deal to do and the police is behind him. So if he does the deal or not you have to find out by watching the movie I have not spoiled anything for you guys. The main hero I have seen him in game of thrones I have always known that he was a good actor and he continues that In this movie too and the walking dead guy he too does a classic acting. The movie has a slow start and it is slow in between I personally felt the movie was dragged in some places but as I said its watchable. The story line was OK so was the ending.\r\nI would say just check it out guys.  \r\nNotable Acting\r\nNikolaj Coster-Waldau famous for his acting in the tv series Game of thrones and the movies Oblivion and Mama\r\nJon Bernthal famous for his acting in the tv series The walking dead and the movies like The wolf of wall street and Sicario\r\n\r\nMy Rating 7/10",

         "I am blown away after watching this masterpiece after hearing a friend talk so highly of it. I asked them what it was about, and they said \"just go watch it\". Well, every now and then a film comes along that will leave an impact on you that will make it hard for you to forget. This film is one of those. This story was told with such realism, even the actors did not seem like they were acting. At first I was hesitant when I saw that Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau - Jaime Lannister from Game of Thrones was cast, but wow did he nail his role. His transition from a white collar to jailed convict was perfect. Even Jon Bernthal's acting was great. For that matter, every character was cast perfectly and were very convincing in their roles. The writing and screenplay is what truly made this film so great. It's a story told really well, transitioning back and forth at just the right time from back-story to current time, although I wish it had opened with the white-collar scene first, then how it led into the incarceration, and then additional back stories filled in. Had the transitioning not happened, it would have been the best documentary-type film I've ever seen, and felt even more realistic. Nevertheless, I still enjoyed the way the story was told as well as the unpredictability and surprise twists. By the end, I was left wanting more! Stunt-man turned writer/director (also both for this film) Ric Roman Waugh did an outstanding job converting the screenplay to a very convincing on-screen masterpiece. The cinematography and editing were perfect, but the score could have been a little better. I hope that based on the ending, there is at least a part 2 that comes out very soon. It's a well deserved 9.5 rounded up to a 10/10 from me. So now, just go watch it!",
         "Strongly recommend watching this, very strong performances from all of the cast. Good score, solid cinematography and a story line that got me hooked from the start and one that I don't doubt for a second has happened numerous times around the world. Will watch again (because that's what i do when i like a film).",
         "The title is the only thing that's not quite there with this movie - it suggests a sort of b-grade thriller. But what this movie actually delivers is a taut, razor-sharp story about how someone's life can go horribly wrong. This is the only thing I've seen NCW in apart from Game Of Thrones and I was blown away by his range - he's in full-on acting mode here, entirely believable, and hard as nails. One of the best movies of 2017.",
         "Intrigued by the trailer, I was expecting, as usually, to be let down by the actual movie. Didn't happen. I really liked it's non-linear progression, which managed to not be annoying and made sense. But didn't give the whole game away either. The pace was engaging - not too fast to where it's just bash-bang- boom and no time to pull you along on the journey and not so slow that you're staring at characters . Also, a big question in the movie is the main guy's motivation for his actions - various characters wonder and ask him directly. While typically the reveal would form a big emotional piece of the plot or would do a 4 second cutaway to a simple explanatory scene, the makers of this movie managed to resist the easy answer and instead left us guessing as well. Thus, making the guy seem even more of a mystery and making the mystery of his motivations itself a theme. Even the relationship with his son - an unavoidable theme - was surprising and seemed fresh. It was also interesting to see the idea of how a good guy turns bad and enters the underworld in such a compelling way - the wannabe psychologist attraction.",
         "After seeing this movie for the first time this Friday, I immediately felt compelled to watch it a second time in a more thorough way (which I did the next day). The movie is so well structured, with perfect dialog, great cast (perfectly suited for their roles), outstanding tempo and content density, excellent cinematography and an amazing performance from Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau, that I feel forced to claim this is the best movie of this year. Really Oscar award material. The IMDb rate so far is completely understated (7.4 at the time I write this review). A MUST WATCH.",
         "I normally don't have time to review or even let alone use IMDb, but this is definitely one of my favorite movies out for 2017 and I HAD TO REVIEW THIS hoping more movies like this comes along. I haven't had any films which kept me interested throughout the entire movie like this in a long time. If you are into movies which brings the feelings of how it would feel like to be in prison and to be in dept of \"prison politics\", this movie is a must watch. The main character \"Jacob\" played his role very well, from a business man to a full blown convict. It might looks crazy, but there are people out there who are really living that lifestyle. I was surprised there were so many familiar faces in this movie I'm sure viewers will recognize, they all pretty much fit into their roles. Over all I would recommend this to everyone looking for that prison experience film. The details with how prison life is so detailed and correct. Everything from the dorm rooms to prison gangs and politics. The only other one like this was a movie called \"Felon\" back in 2008 (but this movie Shot Caller has more action) I was hoping for another one just like it, and this one satisfies me until something similar and better comes along in the near future!",
         "The movie is really good i expected it to be boring, to get lost in the story quick etc. but it keeps you pumped.Directing is good,actors are great.At some parts i did lose focus and couldn't tell who is who, but i managed to figure it out.Plot twist is great, something you wouldn't expect.I would definitely recommend this movie!",
         "The cast, the acting, the screenplay, the directing are all great. There is some really great cinematography and you can tell a lot of time effort and planning have gone into this to get it right. It's a very good production that is quite gripping from beginning to end. Rarely do I take note of the music that accompanies a movie, but here I can't help but applaud the how well the music is matched to this film; simply excellent soundtrack. If I have a criticism it's the speed at which some of the events move and how the details which tightly bind the story together cohesively evaded me at times. I think this may have been as a result of the excessive cutting that was done to ensure the film adhered to the prescribed length, but that's only a guess. I lost my way through sections of the plot at times and I found this a tad frustrating as it really impeded my enjoyment at times. Truthfully it was nothing severe, but with a production like this when you are literally hanging on every word, missing pieces is an annoyance. It is a fairly one sided depiction of life in prison and though I can't comment on the credibility of the scenes portrayed, they served their place as very powerful representations for the purpose of the film. The focal point of the story is quite narrow, so we get a very intense view of the events surrounding our lead but not much else. I think this does limit the depth we get from the other characters at times and perhaps a slightly broader scope would have helped, but once again I'm nit picking, so will leave it at that. I'm glad the producers didn't make this into a crusade for he detrimental effects prison life has on incarcerated individuals, both while they are inside and when they are released. I could understand why some people may feel this film has done that, but I am fairly certain no message was intended here, and I certainly didn't see one; just a great story well told that has all the elements in the right measures to make great viewing. Definitely one of the best films I've seen in 2017. There are a probably hundreds of movies in this genre, I'm not sure if this one will reach iconic status like 'The Shawshank Redemption' but it is definitely one which I could (and probably will) watch repeatedly, which in itself is saying something. Do I recommend you go see it? why hell yes I do! Absolutely.",
         "Unexpectedly, this is one of the better films released this year and is definitely worth watching. Albeit the story-line seems rather dull and predictable at first, I assure you that past the 20min mark you'll be on edge and glued to the screen right to the end. Some of the acting could have been much better considering the actors caliber but the story-line makes up for the shortfall. Without spoiling it for you, it will take balls to watch this film to the harsh, brutal and twisted end. Definitely not for the faint of heart. Would love to see a second installment.",
         "Best film of 2017 so far! Great story, acted superbly and hard as nails story wise. If you like a great crime prison film look no further. Not going to ramble on just watch the film if you like a solid prison crime film. 10 out of 10 for me, hands down best film of 2017 so far, hope I have typed enough text to get this review posted. 10 out of 10!",
         "I never review movies but I just could not miss on an opportunity to recommend this movie to people out there. Certainly one of this years' best movies. Very well told story and the main character. Deep and emotionally quite heavy movie but with quite a lot of action. Ending is so great as well which perfectly sums up Jacobs character and the things and sacrifices you are willing to do for others.",
         "\"Shot Caller\" is a tense, mostly terrifying story of a high ranking, prison gang member (played by Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau) out on parole. On orders from his boss to spearhead a major score of illegal guns, Waldau has no choice but to see it through. To refuse would mean his execution, as well as his family's. Omari Hardwick plays a cop who is also Waldau's parole officer. Somehow, Hardwick is tipped off to the illegal guns; and he puts Waldau on surveillance, gleaning as much information as he can in order to prevent hundreds of fully automatic rifles going out into the streets. Two men on opposite sides of the law, and only one winner will emerge. \"Shot Caller\" is told from two timelines: the present, and the past which reveals how Waldau became the ruthless gangster that he is. It is the past timeline that is the most gripping, showing us a drastically different man who made a mistake that led to a devastating, downward spiral of his life. But years in prison has not fully transformed Waldau\u0085carefully hidden deep within the monster, there is a bit of humanity left. My most memorable, movie moment of \"Shot Caller\" is the scene when Waldau butchers a fellow gangster in the man's home. No fancy choreography, just someone getting stabbed multiple times until his life ends. \"Shot Caller\" would have received a higher grade but for the shenanigans near the end of the movie. **SPOILER ALERT**Waldau hides a weapon in his anus, and from the time he is captured to the time he is sent back to his old prison, the weapon is still there? No law enforcement personnel ever looked up his butt to see if there were anything hidden there? Also, when Waldau attacked his boss because Waldau's family were threatened with execution, how does Waldau know that the hit wasn't already in place? These are big shenanigans, but the rest of the movie is so good that they didn't damage the movie much. For those who enjoy a good drama/suspense/prison movie, this one is definitely for you.

         "i don't think i can really express how good this film is in words, but ill do my best... Its about more than just a man screwed by life, it about loyalty and family, and where you will ever go to protect those you love. I must say, this one is on my top 3 of the year. Brutal and deep film that touches you.",
         "It has been a long time since I wrote a review but this movie deserves my time and attention. I definitely did not expect this movie to touch me in the way that it did. The Pros:- -It is so well edited that I had to recheck the run time of the movie when it ended. Two hours flew past like the wind. -The acting is great. -The plot will reel you in and never let go. This is simple story telling at it's best. -The dialogue will never feel boring and the prison scenes are shot in a way that will leave you in awe. -The score is one of the best I've heard in recent memory. Reminds me of Sicario, another great film. Some people said it could have been better but I disagree. The score had me wishing I can write music that good for movies. It had a certain twist to it, sounds of flutes or sounds of Arabian music undertones. The directing? All hail Ric Roman Waugh. I'm going to search for some of his other movies. If half are as half as good as half of this film, I might pass out with glee. The Cons: There are non I can think of. I wrote this review a few days after seeing the film so that I can write a honest review absent attachment to the film. Go see it.",
         "One of the best movies I have watched in 2017, just go watch it, seriously. The pace is perfect, keeps you intrigued and you honestly have no idea what is going to happen to the guy until the very last. Wow, what a flick!",
         "As a matter of fact, I find it hard to watch movies lately. They all seem so commonplace... But this one really kept me going. Although the ideas are not new, they are brilliantly brought by excellent dialogues, directing and acting. A male's true role in a common family (wait till you are 50 with grown children to understand) is also depicted here with an interesting angle. I hate blowing my own horn, but even the plot got me surprised here and there which is not very common. Not for youngsters, but don't miss it.",
         "Give me a break, so the lead starts out as a yuppie with a great job, great house and a family, goes out with friends one night, has some drinks, gets in an accident and gets a friend killed, ending up in maximum security prison? I've never been able to verify this is true, that you do get sent to Max for DUI manslaughter, but if you had to ask me, I'd think it was unlikely. I also would think it's unlikely someone would become a big crime lord while in prison, especially coming from a DUI manslaughter charge. Come on. Like Oz, I think this movie was solely aimed to scare middle class, rich suburban types to attract more attention to it. Some ex-cons have shared their prison experiences on some other sites and basically said it's not as bad as everyone makes it out to be. Many ex-cons also do not fit any sort of stereotype. For instance, looking at the lead coming out of prison with his hair and his shirt was hilarious. Got a huge red flag from that itself.",
         "I thoroughly enjoyed this film. Superb acting. Well-directed/edited. Wonderful score, although I could see how some may find the music overwhelming- however, it's beautiful enough to take a primary role. Actors you will recognize- always interesting. If you enjoy placing yourself in someone's shoes who must make rational and logical decisions based on the circumstances of the story, you will love this film- but only if you're prepared to think with the edge that may be necessary to survive in those shoes. Well-done.",
         "The acting was good. The plot or lack of is one of the reasons I didn't enjoy the film. It was morose all the way through. The thought of someone going to a violent prison because of a car accident was ludicrous. There is not much explanation in the movie except in the form of continual time-line jumping, which got confusing. I even had to look up terms they were talking about in order to understand some of the film. I do not recommend this film. Apparently some enjoyed this...I did not.",
         "So someone jumps a red light accidentally and causes a fatality. OK Is sentenced to 16 months after some plea bargaining. OK But then ends up in a very violent maximum security prison and ends up joining a gang and committing murders on behalf of that gang ??? Sorry but that's where the story line just got a bit to much for me. If you can suspend reality for a moment maybe you can enjoy this film like some of the other reviewers but the basic concept spoiled it for me. Maybe if the character was a misguided criminal or something it would have been more believable.",
         "Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau.. nothing more to say. Great story, loved these 2 hours, worth every minute. Sad end, when you see him starring to the picture at his son. So few seconds but it summits the whole plot and the main purpose. Great! This movie deserves recognition, spread it!",
         "I saw this film 6/21/2017 at a preview screening. It was a movie that started interesting, but the more it went on, the more i started to wonder \"what's the point?\" until it ended leaving me feeling very lukewarm. The film follows a non linear progression, it paints a dramatic picture about family, the prison system and how it changes people. Coaster-Waldau plays the protagonist \"Money\" and we follow his journey through the prison system interwoven into a plot about an impending deal between two criminal gangs. The acting is quite good, camera is decent, score was a little on the dramatic side for a movie like this. for me it all comes down to the poor story. To me it felt like an Antoine Fuqua kind of movie, but without a good story. Some plot points feel unresolved and parts feel like they could use some more attention. Some might like it, some might not, personally i have a hard time recommending it though due to its length and lack of any real plot. i think i get what Waugh was trying to say but sadly it falls flat.",
         "I, like the fans of the streetwise and realistic style of the likes of David Ayer will applaud this movie. It can somewhat be seen as a spiritual prequel to the directors former great movie Felon (2008). This movie is just as good, and even feels like an epic at times. If the movie was set in the 17 century or the roman empire, many of the same themes would apply. I don't need to praise it more, others have already commented the superb cinematography and acting. While movie is good, it is sadly not flawless. The motivations of main character seems at times unreasonable. The screenplay should established a stronger motivation from the start. Why choose the impending life sentence over 18 months, if your main goal is your family well being? The dangers of not being in a gang should be more explictly adressed. It almost seems like he have a choice in the beginning, and could have been fine on his own. He wasn't particularly \"unlucky\" either, resulting in inevitable gang membership. And as a result of the unclear motivation, the plot then seems less tight. With some minor tweaks this would have been fixed. For all i know, i might been trimmed away in the editing room.",
         "They try to kill Money in a party! Why? Just wait for him to be alone then get the job done. What's the point of getting him murdered in a crowded area? It didn't seem that they (Shotgun and Herman) would be the first suspects if Money gets killed. Jennifer sues him, but their families seemed very close to each other. The lawyer knows about that prison and its dangerous situations. So, the guards, manager and ... must know it too. And yet, no one seems to care. The scene in prison where he kills the snitch was weird. In the riot scene, how they've got those long blades? Did they do it like that balloon? Why did he save Herman Gomez? Why did the sniper shoot to the head? I think firing to the sky or a leg would be sufficient too. See, this is a prison where they put him in. Why? The whole riot idea was wrong. Why would you riot when you know that some/all of your guys might get killed or be seen by cameras? What's the point? Where did this obsession to kill other guys come from? How did he figure out how to open handcuffs with that thing? At the end, he receives a letter from his son. He says \"I will learn from your mistakes.\" What mistakes exactly? Driving carelessly? Emory Cohen's character (Howie) wasn't convincing. He looks so naive to decide and plan this deal, find contractors to move guns to America, and get involved with gangsters. Even by cooperating with his friend in Afghanistan, it seemed strange. So, criminals in a gang follow someone who kills their current boss. The new boss just needs to claim it. Character development wasn't OK. There is almost a loop in background music. Perhaps with some changes in the script and characters this would be a great movie. But it's not.",
         "This is probably my favourite film of 2017! I really enjoyed the acting, you can read the character's feelings simply from looking at Nikolaj's face. The story is quite interesting and refreshing. It's definitely a great film, and I would love to see a sequel, but knowing how good other movie sequels do, I'm afraid it might disappoint me. I recommended this movie to everyone I know and now, I recommend it to you, dear random person!"
