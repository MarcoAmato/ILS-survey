            "content": "A science-fiction movie that has dazzling scenery but also goes into some disturbing territory.  Two people (Jennifer Lawrence, Chris Pratt)  are stranded on a malfunctioning starship over which they have little control.  At first they can divert themselves with all the material wealth at their disposal.  But when one commits a crime against the other, there is no society and no judicial system that can handle the offense.  How can they work it out the ethics of punishment, penance, and rehabilitation between them?\r\n\r\nThe movie is marred by some scenes that look impressive but aren't scientifically accurate, particularly where gravity is concerned.  Probably added by studio suits who wanted to wow the audience but didn't understand or care about the underlying science.  But that's par for the course for most science fiction movies.",

            "content": "**A space-travel tale!**\r\n\r\nI was going to watch it, but not expecting it to be a masterpiece. It was not, yet surprised to be a lot better film when it comes to todays film overcrowded with space themes. The entire story takes place on a spaceship. It's a space journey tale, when the mankind with 5,000 on-board heading for a new home planet, but one of them unexpectedly wakes up from his hibernation pod. It's supposed to wake him and everybody a few months before their destination, so now he's up nearly a century early, and what he plans to do is what the adventures covered in the rest of the film.\r\n\r\nThere's no connection to the 2008 film of the same name. Initially I thought it was like a live-action version of 'Wall-E'. Not entirely, only a few scenes and the main two characters remind Wall-E and Eva. It is also a limited cast film and I loved the simple screenplay, but strong enough to be one of the best in its kind. The actors were very good. The visuals were beautiful, a perfect film for the late night to watch alone peacefully.\r\n\r\nFrom the Norwegian director of 'Headhunters' fame. This is not his Hollywood debut, but previously he had got an Oscar nomination for the film 'The Imitation Game'. The concept was like 'The Blue Lagoon' or kind of the space version of the Eden Garden tale. I had predicted a few scenes, those were too simple to do that. The real big thing came in the later part, especially when all the focus shifts to more than the initial narration. Scientifically, not everything believable, but cinematically, anything can be possible. So with a such concept, the film headed to the conclusion where a twist came into play. Entertainment is guaranteed. One of the year's best that should not be missed. Recommended!\r\n\r\n8/10",

            "content": "Crusoe and Girl Friday.\r\n\r\nPretty much reviled by professional critics, Passengers has overcome that to hold affection with a good portion of the sci-fi loving public. More safe sci-fi footings than anything remotely ground breaking, it ends up a a tidy romantic piece that's laced with pertinent questions involving man and his/her reactions to extraordinary scenario's.\r\n\r\nAlthough the viewer is for the most part hankering for action to explode off the screen, it's only when - in the film's last quarter - you realise that it was actually working fine as a character study without the fireworks.\r\n\r\nChris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence have bunches of charisma, in fact more than enough to carry the story through its more shaky elements. They in turn are aided by Michael Sheen who is perfectly cast as the Android (not Robot!) bartender Arthur.\r\n\r\nThe effects work is impressive and director Morten Tyldum stitches the set pieces together admirably, the highlight being a rather superb gravity loss sequence. While the sound mix is also to be applauded.\r\n\r\nNewcomers should expect a Robinson Crusoe love story in space as opposed to a sci-fi actioner, though one with more cerebral strains than at first hinted, because then the pic delivers a good time and adds to what is turning out to be a rather great decade for sci-fi fans. 7/10",

      "synopsis": "The movie opens in outer space with the starship Avalon on autopilot heading to the colony world of Homestead II during a mass exodus of Earth's population. The crew and the 5,000 passengers are all in hibernation pods for the 120-year journey. It is 30 years into the journey. The ship travels through a meteor storm, and power is diverted to the forward shields, then the ship collides with a large meteor and the power blinks, red alert screens come on in the control area, then quickly go back to normal. Something bad has happened. Jim Preston (Chris Pratt), a mechanical engineer, wakes up in his pod with a cheery computer voice telling him that soon they will be arriving at Homestead II. He is told that it is normal to feel confused and weak after being in hibernation. The wristband on his arm is scanned, and the computer leads him to his cabin where he sleeps. The next day he wakes up, tries to decide what to wear when meeting fellow passengers, then makes his way to a cafeteria where he is the only one. He goes to an orientation session about life as a colonist on Homestead, but he is the only one there. The cheery computer generated instructor cannot understand his question about why no one else is there. Jim goes to the Main Concourse and gets no help from the information kiosk. He finds an office where he can send a message to the Homestead Company, that he is warned will be expensive. He sends a message explaining he is the only one awake and needs help, then finds out it will be fifteen years before anyone on earth receives his message. He is on his own. Jim finds manuals for all the ship equipment. He studies the manual on the hibernation pods but cannot find a way to get it started again once the person has woken up. He cannot get into the area where the crew pods are to try and wake anyone for help, and he cannot get into the command area. His wristband does not give him the proper clearance. Jim finds the robot bartender Arthur (Michael Sheen) who he can talk to, but the robot is programmed to dispense bartender advice, like if you don't like where you are, change things. Jim is a general class passenger with a basic cabin, and he breaks into a suite with nicer amenities. Jim becomes more desperately lonely. He goes to an area where passengers can put on a space suit and go outside while safely tethered to the ship. Jim contemplates suicide by opening the airlock without a spacesuit, but stops himself and runs into the pod area. He trips near a pod with a lovely woman inside, Aurora (Jennifer Lawrence). He studies her passenger profile she had recorded before the ship set sail. She is a journalist and is traveling to Homestead to have an adventure and learn about why people choose to be a colonist. He reads her stories and thinks she is perfect. He wrestles with himself about waking her up, knowing that it will doom her to die on the ship, but he cannot stand the isolation after a year alone, so he manually makes her pod wake her up, hiding before she can see him. The same cheery computer program wakes up Aurora and leads her to her cabin to sleep. Aurora wakes up the next day alone and wanders to the grand concourse where she meets Jim. He tells her the truth about how long he has been awake, but he doesn't tell her that he woke her up. He has asked Arthur the robot bartender not to tell Aurora what he has done, and Arthur agrees. Aurora and Jim talk daily, discuss what can be tried to fix the pods. Aurora swims, runs, and begins to write her story. She asks why Jim left planet Earth, and he says he likes to make things and fix things, and on Earth, things get replaced when they break and are not fixed. He wants to live in a house he builds himself. Her plan was to travel to the colony, spend a year there talking to colonists about why they left Earth, then return to Earth. After some time of getting to know each other, Jim asks Aurora on a date and she accepts. After they eat, he takes her to the spacesuit room, and there are two suits and they both get dressed and go outside. Coming back in, Aurora is excited, and they go to Jim's cabin and make love. They are happy, have their routine of exercise, watching the stars, taking advantage of the ships entertainment and restaurant venues. It's Aurora's birthday, and Jim plans a special surprise, he made a ring for her. Going in the bar, Aurora tells Arthur that she and Jim have no secrets and Jim agrees. Jim steps into the men's room, and Arthur tells Aurora what a good choice Jim made to pick her to wake up. Aurora is angry, devastated, furious, and tells Jim to stay away from her. While all of this is going on, the control room is more frequently getting alerts of system failures, more over time. Jim and Aurora have noticed small things like the cleaning robots having system failures. It's now two years since the meteor collision. One day Gus (Laurence Fishburne) wakes up and appears on the concourse, he is a deck crew chief and has woken up early. Hibernation Pods have never failed before, and he explains that something major is wrong. His wristband gets them into the command center, where they find that the ships automatic diagnostics have failed and they need to check every deck manually. While he tests before they start this, there is a major gravity failure and Aurora almost drowns. There have been cascading failures, and the computer can make a timeline that shows the first failure was two years before. The area first affected was in the main engine area, but they will have to do a manual inspection to tell where. At this point, Gus collapses, and Jim and Aurora take him to the infirmary and put him in the medical auto diagnostic scanner. There are multiple necrosis all throughout his body and death is imminent, probably because of the malfunctioning hibernation pod. He puts on his uniform and prepares to die, and gives him and Aurora his wristband, so they can access the areas of the ship they need to go to fix things. In engineering, Jim and Aurora find a hole made by a meteorite that goes thru some critical areas. When they open one door, Aurora is almost sucked out because of a hole thru the hull. She blocks it with a tablet Jim pushes to her, the area pressurizes, and they then learn the fusion engine exhaust has to be manually vented. The manual override won't work, Jim has to get into a spacesuit and go outside to fix it. He ends up having to go into the exhaust passage to open a flap, but it won't stay open, he had to hold it so that the manual vent will work. Aurora argues with him over the radio, but she pulls the lever. Jim is pushed out, his tether breaks, and there is a hole in his suit. He tells Aurora goodbye. She runs to get into a spacesuit herself and goes to look for him. She retrieves Jim by grabbing his tether, but when they get inside, he is unresponsive. She drags him to the infirmary, and the auto-doc says Jim is dead. Aurora uses Gus' wristband and his override code to get the machine to resuscitate Jim, and it works. He is alive, and she is overjoyed. Later, things are back to normal on the ship. Jim works on the auto-doc and tells Aurora he found that using the command override he could put her back in hibernation in the infirmary, but he would be alone again. Aurora chooses to stay awake with him. 88 years later... It's the end of the voyage, and the captain and crew awake and come to the grand concourse to find there is a huge tree, lots of trailing vines and vegetation, birds flying, and a cabin (that might have people in it.) Aurora's voice-over is reading her story to the passengers, which they made a good life where they were.",

         "I'm just going to list my takeaways from the movie in list format. Maybe it will be helpful to someone, maybe not. Pros - The production is immaculate. The cinematography, set design, CGI, all of it is top notch, as expected from a movie starring two of the most popular current actors. - Although I'm not crazy about Jennifer Lawrence, and I only really like Chris Pratt as Starlord, I will go ahead and list them as a pro, since they did a good job with these characters. Michael Sheen is also welcome in any movie. Cons - The science of the movie is a bit slinky at times, obviously to serve narrative motives. Other reviewers have detailed these inaccuracies, so I won't get into it, here. - The movie mostly leans toward a romantic drama vibe, and I personally think there should have been more of a sense of dread and danger throughout the movie, not just near the end. - Given the high profile status of the leads, the sex scenes are predictably tame and brief. Along with the lack of danger, the lack of eroticism is another way in which the movie plays it too safe. - The catharsis at the end that stems from the main moral dilemma (which I won't spoil) does not occur satisfactorily in my opinion. It didn't move me at all, and made it feel like it was never that important to begin with. In summary, this is an entertaining, but light sci-fi romance. It feels like a 70's sci-thriller that has been thoroughly processed for a general audience. It makes a good rental, but I couldn't help but lament that it wasn't the riskier, edgier film that it wanted to be.",
         "Note that this contains spoilers. If you haven't watched the film, I suggest you do before reading this. The first hour or so of this film was fantastic. Just taking in the spacecraft with all its amazingly conceived features, was reminiscent of the first part of 2001: A Space Odyssey. It also struck me as being a realistic version of the type of spacecraft in Wall-E (think of the little cleaner droids, buzzing around, fixing things and cleaning the mess the characters make!) The premise of being alone on a vast, automated, self-repairing craft that is aware of your presence and provides all the conveniences you require, was an interesting concept. The technology and physics seemed plausible, cool, and realistic; and the special effects were restrained and effective. The robot bartender was fascinating, and provided some welcome entertainment. For the first hour the story seemed meaningful and thought-provoking, but after that it began to fall apart. A major aspect of the plot during the first half of the movie was being unable to get to the crews' quarters to wake them up, and the hopelessness of the situation because of this. Then, as if by magic, one of the crew wakes up, says there's something wrong with the ship, wanders around a bit, then dies. From then on it seemed to me like the script had been taken over by a different person, there to ensure the film served the public the usual smattering of sensationalist action scenes at expense of both the plot and plausibility of science. There is a brief promise of mystery as the trio realised there was something wrong with the ship and tried to figure out what it was, but this quickly evaporates as the problem turns out to be nothing more than a faulty nuclear reactor that is heading for self-destruction. The obvious thing to have done here would have been to wake more of the crew, now that they had access, to see what could be done. However, we are told there is not time for that, so the protagonist miraculously fixes the nuclear reactor all by himself. What a genius! This involved finding and hot-swapping a replacement circuit board, getting blasted into space, being spectacularly rescued by his female companion, dying, and finally brought back to life by having about a dozen or so different resuscitation techniques applied to him at once by a machine! Yeah. Face palm.",
         "I have to admit that I had low expectations when I was going to see this movie. The negative reviews are why. Appearance that the film has gone bad, not earned enough, etc. But it does not make sense to listen to others. The best part is to find out yourself. And I have to admit that I enjoyed this movie well, even though I understand some of the criticisms. At the same time, I know that Morten Tyldum is an incredibly good director. One of the best Norwegian directors, without a doubt. I think it's strange that he made something directly bad. The film is not a featured sci fi movie, even if the action takes place on a spaceship. I enjoyed the movie for three reasons: 1) The story is unique, and something I've never seen before. It's always a good sign. 2) It's beautiful to watch, great movie, spectacular setups and scenes. It was impressive and 3) This movie works to switch between a love story and some action sequences. It seems like a thoughtful movie, and I appreciated the thought behind scenes and action. The few people we meet in the film give insight and one becomes familiar with the characters. It is also a strength, but perhaps also a weakness. The gallery is limited. But anyway, I recommend this and hope to see similar movies in the future.",
         "It takes a lot for me to take the time to review a movie. In this case I feel strongly compelled to do so, and heartily agree with those who found this movie to be thoroughly enjoyable. I almost passed on this movie because I mistakenly read a few critic reviews. So I will proceed to counter a few of the critics arguments. 1) \"A conclusion (to the movie) that's as egregiously contrived and corny as it is predictable\". Yes, this genre has one of two ways to end. They all do. Good or bad. To guess correctly doesn't mean it's predictable or that you're a genius. There were a number of times in the movie that the script could have gone one way or another, and I was in suspense each time. 2) \"....production design is polished to the point of looking chintzy.\" \"Polished\"?? The ship is a highly technological feat of engineering that's carrying 5,000 passengers 90 years into space. It's SUPPOSED to look \"polished\"! As a design artist who is into sci-fi I thought the set designs were well done. 3) \"....\"Passengers\" increasingly succumbs to timidity and begins shrinking into a bland science-fiction adventure\". Probably written by someone who is not into sci-fi or feels that the genre is not as legitimate as other \"higher\" forms of art. The movie was thought provoking and raises quite a few questions of morality and acts of right-or-wrong. The concept is also far more original than most sci-fi movies. 4) \"....perfunctory, suspense-free spacewalks\". Did these people watch the same movie as I did? There were three spacewalks in the movie. The first two were not meant to be suspenseful, but to convey what it would be like to actually do so for the first time. The last was anything but \"suspense-free\"! In conclusion, my recommendation is to not be swayed by over-paid critics or critic wanna-be's. If it's a genre you like, and it's got relatively acceptable reviews (by regular movie-goers like us)....give it a shot! In the case of \"Passengers\", I think you'll agree with the 70% who liked the movie.",
         "Professional film critics are stupid. That is the conclusion you must reach after watching this movie. I was not expecting much after reading the uniformly negative critical reviews. But I was surprised. The movie is plausible. It is more than plausible, it is realistic. And the acting is so eminent that you are there yourself trying to decide what you would do if you awoke on a fully autonomous spaceship trying to figure out what is going on. Granted, there are no alien horror creatures, no protracted fast-action sequences, no superficial technical nonsense to cover a thin plot. Maybe this is what the critics were missing. There is only beautiful scenes, eminent acting, a plausible plot and a surprising ending. But that was enough for me. So go watch this movie and decide for yourself how implausibly stupid the film critics are.",
         "I'm almost convinced film critics are paid off...I thoroughly enjoyed this movie more than most of the \"critically acclaimed\" films I've watched this year. This movie had everything- love, drama, philosophical/existential questions, and incredibly suspenseful moments (and not just action scenes!!). The acting was great, pacing was good (never was bored), and the visuals were amazing as well. Also the trailer didn't spoil the movie at all, which was nice. My only gripe would be about the ending, which was still fine. Overall would really recommend watching over the holidays. Really enjoyed it.",
         "The movie is definitely worth your time. Firstly, 10/10 for realism. I would absolutely have done all those things if I were in their shoes. Secondly, the acting is one of the best I've seen (I was pretty skeptical about J.Lawrence but not anymore after this movie; and Chris Pratt's acting keeps getting better and better since GotG). The plot is quite unique (I do not believe I've ever seen another plot that resemble this). Lastly, the visuals is BREATHTAKING (I absolutely adore the ship design). The pacing was a little bit too fast at the end but not that noticeable. Rating: 9/10 Sometime a simple movie with simple plot is better than s**t like Batman vs Superman because there are less space for mistakes. Also, do not expect much action in this movie (I expected more action but in the end I was OK without it.) Also, sleeping beauty is also named Aurora xD",
         "After the trailer release of this movie it became one of this year's most anticipated movies, but some people were expecting something entirely different than what this movie aimed for, and the result was their disappointment. People need to be aware that this movie is an ADVENTURE/ROMANCE and a bit SCI-FI. NOT A SCI-FI 2001:SPACE ODYSSEY KIND OF MOVIE. I will start giving my own honest review of this movie. First of all, The acting in this movie is phenomenal, of course when you get 2 great actors like Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence you know it would work in any kind of role, and it's true, the chemistry between both of them just works flawlessly and it's very gorgeous as they're both very handsome and it's just nice to see them on screen. Then comes the VISUALS, which i consider to be this year's best ( Along with Dr.Strange ), The best way to watch this movie is at a theater with a huge screen and definitely better to catch the 3D version. I really don't know where to start with the visuals because the whole movie is just beautifully shot and the CINEMATOGRAPHY of this film is perfectly done, probably each scene in this movie is Iconic. The Plot wasn't as good as the other factors but still it managed to keep the pacing of the movie going and I was definitely not bored, even though the ending wasn't spectacular but again this isn't Christopher Nolan's Interstellar, this is just a movie about 2 lovers surviving on a spaceship alone. The best way to describe this film is to say that it's Titanic all over again but in space and it's beautifully shot, emotional, and overall an exciting experience. It's really sad that people misunderstood the point of this film and were going for a complex space/time plot instead of a simple good-looking love story, but I know that moviegoers will definitely like this film. Give it a try and if not for the story then just for Wonderful scenes and for the link between the 2 main characters Conclusion: Great, Simple, Gorgeous and Highly Entertaining are the four things you'll be saying after watching this movie.",
         "I'm a forty-something male and I loved this movie. I didn't quite know what to expect, saw some less than glowing reviews, but decided to favor the more positive reviews and head to the theater. I'm glad I did. If you like science fiction, this has it. If you like romance, this has it. If you like excellent special effects, this has it. If you like a good story, yes, this movie has that too. This isn't a Star-Trek style high-octane Sci-Fi action movie. It's a solid blend of drama, romance, action, intrigue, stunning visuals, occasional suspense, human psychology, and for me was a winning combination.",
         "Passengers is yet another example as to why you should go see the movies professional critics hate & save your money on the ones they absolutely love. Going to see a movie at the theater is like $30 now for just 2 people & that's without visiting concessions. I don't know about everybody else but if I'm going to spend a few days worth of grocery money for a 2 hour movie experience I'm really hoping not to be bored to tears or looking at the time wondering how much longer it'll be until a movie is over. Passengers just ends up on my very long list, lately, of movies critics tried to bring down that were waves better than the ones they are directing people to see. This movie is visually stunning & the story telling is not only thought provoking but innovative while doing so! It was great to see a story like this one told in a way that didn't spend most of its time trying to dialogue it's way into Oscar nominations. If you are going to venture out to see a movie for the Holidays go see this one!",
         "If you want a very enjoyable, aesthetically pleasing and romantic movie to watch, I think this is absolutely perfect. I think critics are giving it bad reviews because it didn't have the best dialogue, so don't go if you're just looking for something negative in a movie. If you're emotional, I think this would be a good movie to watch during that time. It's beautiful, well done, heartbreaking in some moments, and has amazing actors. It's comedic and romantic, with some intense parts so it has a lot of complements and genres in it. This isn't a negative thing at all, this movie just has it all. The story line and the message are thought provoking, and it's an all around amazing movie.",
         "I don't quite get all the hate that this film gets... I can also think of great number of recent alleged sci-fi films that don't deserve a minute of one's time, yet they are cherished and loved. In any case, I went to see Passengers with high expectations. While I am not a fan of either Jennifer Lawrence or Chris Pratt, they were very good in this film - good enough to immerse me in the story (unlike most other alleged sci-films these days). I've been a fan of Michael Sheen ever since I saw him in Midnight in Paris where he was brilliant also, and his performance in Passengers was so good that it is easy to forget that this synthetic robot with a plastic smile is brought to you by a thespian. What a performance! Worth seeing just for that alone. The story is by now well known, due to spoilers being given away like candy during Halloween and partly due to (leaked?) script that was posted a while ago. Most importantly: the film has been changed from the original script and for the better. The thing that I liked about this film is that first of all - it is not stupid. I did not have to put an extra effort to suspend my disbelief the way I had to for most recent sci-fi favorites (except Martian which I liked). Yes there may be one or two occasions when I knew that \"such would be almost impossible\" but even then, there is also an option that the situation had something that we, the viewers may not be aware of. For instance, the sudden loss of gravity would require sudden stopping of the rotation of the ship; that would require enormous amount of energy, otherwise things don't just stop in space. But, who knows - maybe the ship did decide to stop the rotation? So not entirely impossible (this is not a spoiler because the official trailer clearly suggests loss of gravity). The drama of the film is obviously based on the fact that two passengers woke up too early during their cross-universe trip. No matter what you think of the morality of how that all happened, remember this is a film and not televangelism. In other words: there is no space for political correctness in character portrayal. In the end, I can say that there was plenty to enjoy in this film, from excellent visuals to great performances all around. I actually plan to buy this in bluray, which I don't do that often with new movies (my library of recent films includes \"Argo\", \"Dallas Buyers Club\", \"Midnight in Paris\"...) If you are expecting another marvel-comic inspired super-hero driven FX fest, you will be disappointed. No iron-men or spider-men or any other mutants in here. Just your plain simple ordinary humans with all their shortcomings. But if you are looking for an interesting story, with an interesting premise, and no cringe-worthy \"even kids know this is impossible\" moments, than this is for you. ps. I loved the attention to detail which translated to some really cute and funny scenes...",
         "I read many of the reviews too, and while I always say that every movie will treat everyone in a different way, I am a little surprised by the amount of people who didn't enjoy it! I thought this movie was beautiful! If you want a movie with conflict, space exploration, romance, and sci-fi...this movie is for you. While it's not loaded with 'blow em up' action, the movie is filled with tension and does have some great action scenes. The best aspect of the movie (to me) is that the filmmakers were very successful at turning a situation so incredible into something simple and human. I walked away from this movie not wanting it to end. Screw the bad reviews, see it for yourself and maybe you'll see what I saw!",
         "The trailers made this out as serious science fiction, but it was basically a glorified \"boy meets girl\" movie in space. Apart from a sleep inducing middle act where nothing happens apart from the two leads courting each other, the suspension of disbelief needed here, is staggering, mainly in the form of seemingly superhuman protagonists. Some spoilers ahead: 1. A woman passes out while in a bubble of water, effectively drowning, then miraculously \"wakes up\", while still in the water a few minutes later just because the bubble splashes down into a pool. 2. On multiple occasions people slipping on something and crash landing on their back leaves no damage other than them simply getting up and saying \"ouch\" as if it's a cartoon. 3. Male lead withstands thermonuclear blast at the end without as much as a heat rash, then runs out of oxygen due to a cracked helmet and drifts into space, but instead of freezing and suffocating when the air runs out gets rescued by his girlfriend who simply jumps off the star- ship in his general direction and miraculously catches him. 4. Out of 5000 pods, the one of the guy they really need malfunctions, who wakes up, explains how they can save the ship (which he's completely unqualified for given his job), and then being the token black guy, dies pretty much straight away. 6. Woman suffers major upper body trauma but carries on as if nothing happens. With a bit of care to some details and without the totally artificial and forced happy ending this could have been really good. As it is, it came across as desperate to not challenge its target audience too much and suffered for it.",
         "Visually just stunning and good acting, but the content of the story was pretty standard romance-story: Guy does something wrong, lies about it to the girl, they fall in love, girl finds out the lie, they split up but come together in the final moments of the film. If this story was not on the spaceship, it would be same crap that you see in every romantic movie. But they are on spaceship that is dying and that environment rises this movie from 4 to 7. But overall the clich√© counter is very high on this. A lot of last minute saves and coincidences.",
         "I dislike reviews that summarize the plot or discuss the plot unless the latter is done to support an opinion. So, I will not do this in this review. Here are my thoughts and impressions. This film that was a very pleasant surprise. I had no expectations and enjoyed seeing the two actors (Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence) in a genre film and role I hadn't seen them in before. My only previous experience of seeing these two on the screen previously were 5 year engagement (which I LOVE) and hunger games (meh, its okay). These two are great in this film. There is a great chemistry and given the romantic turn this film takes, it works. The plot is great too--I like how the film explores the nature of space travel and the realistic challenges that it creates in the life of mere mortal humans. I also enjoyed seeing these characters grapple with some very serious predicaments that forced some decisions that could be viewed as selfish and suddenly turns to be completely unselfish. This film is not a run of the mill film--it has some great ideas and perhaps even themes (if you give it some thought) that are explored exceptionally well.",
         "Amazing film. I didn't know what to expect, all I knew going in was that two people woke up 90 years too soon, on their way to a distant planet. I came out having seen well-developed characters faced with difficult choices and having to come to term with those choices. To me, a very realistic movie about human nature, ultimately. I guess Neil DeGrasse Tyson or whoever will soon make a statement on the movie's accuracy, but as far as I could see (being a closet nerd for interstellar travel), it did it better than many films in the past have. The one minor nitpick I could find in the whole film, was when the ship announces them passing a star close up - why did the ship have it programmed to announce it, if they were not going to be awake for another 90 years? But to me, this film had everything. Good pacing, just enough action, emotion, suspense, and believable characters that I ended up really feeling for, and like in another film I just watched (Light between oceans), you see one of the main characters making a terrible decision but you know that in the same situation, anyone would have done the same thing. To those that down vote it or boycott it because \"a man is taking advantage of a woman\" - get a life. Not everything has to be about your political agenda, or gender or race. If the gender roles were reversed, we wouldn't be hearing a peep from you. So sit down and enjoy an amazing movie.",
         "In all science fiction, suspension of disbelief is required to become engaged in the story. However, what the writers of Passengers fail to realize is that suspension of disbelief applies to technology, not human stupidity. The audience can overlook warp drive, ray guns, transporters, etc., but what can't be overlooked is a total lack of common sense in using this technology. There were many opportunities for interesting story lines, but Passengers attempts to patch plot holes that don't work instead of exploring concepts that do. The story centers around a star ship with 5000 passengers and over 200 crew members placed in hibernation for a 120 year trip to another star system to colonize another planet. This part of the story is plausible and even thought provoking. Even the ship itself is based on realistic designs. The science behind this background is sound. The ship is traveling at half the speed of light to a star system 60 light years away for a 120 year trip. Passengers are placed in hibernation to make the trip. So far all of this works and is interesting, but this is about a 5 minute background setting. After that things fall apart. Two passengers are accidentally awoken 90 years too early and face death from old age out in the void of space before reaching a destination. To make this plot work, the unbelievable is required. First, no one is watching the ship, not even automation. If this was a real ship, when an anomaly is detected the crew would be awoken to take care of the problem and put back into hibernation even if they do not take shifts over the century long trip. Second, there is no way to get a person back into hibernation in any way whatsoever. On a trip like this, that disbelief cannot be suspended, because it is too absurd to imagine. There are other things about this story that cannot be disbelieved, but the ones I have mentioned make this plot fall apart. One aspect that is interesting, but not properly explored is the reference to The Shining that dominates the movie. When this reference is first introduced the parallels to the insanity that develops from isolation or even possibly a haunted ship were obvious and the prospect exciting. However, the movie does not explore this and the reference is relegated to a running joke. Unfortunate. The setup of the plot has so many possibilities, but you will end this movie realizing that it is a classic example of a problem script that piles on the increasingly absurd and unbelievable in an attempt to cover the holes.",
         "I waited for this one a for a while. I had to be in the right frame of mind. And then I watched this one on a quiet evening and found myself enjoying it. Wake a Man up on a vast spaceship ahead of schedule, with no way of going back into Hibernation, knowing that he will never live to see the end of the journey. He's Alone, but he's surrounded by sleeping people...What would you do? For a Science Fiction movie, it moved at a leisurely pace...Sans Space Battles, Sans slavering Aliens, Sans Homicidal Central Computers, Sans crawling outer-space monsters...It's an accidental relationship movie on a ship light-years in the middle of nowhere... The Premise was believable. The Characters were likable. Their Actions ... 'Stood to Reason' The Moral Question was commendable. The Spaceship was AWESOME. The Ending could have used a better formulation, but it was nicely poetic just the same... Star Wars or Star Trek this isn't. But it's certainly not Grade B Late night CableTV dreck. Rent this one on a cool Saturday night. OH...Totally Girlfriend Approved!!",
         "Passengers stars Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence, they along with 5,000 others are currently en route to inhabit Planet Homestead II. Suddenly the corkscrewing vessel goes through an asteroid field shorting out his cryo-pod and waking him too early. He becomes distraught to discover he's got 90 years left of his journey. He eventually accepts his fate, but after a while he gets lonely to the brink of suicide. So after browsing through her video blogs, he decides to wake up Aurora played by Lawrence. Gradually as the film goes on they start falling for each other and by this point, it does start to feel like Titanic in space. Director Morten Tyldum does his best with Prometheus' John Spaihts script (which was on Hollywoods Blacklist for 10 years) He keeps the film eerie and atmospheric with the sterile lighting of the interior, and the sometimes haunting music score by Thomas Newman. It tones down on the overused comedic acting we are so accustomed to from the two lead actors, especially Pratt. There is some good chemistry between the two leads and the visual effects look great. However It does have its flaws, one being the fact that it lacks originality. It doesn't quite reach the tension levels of the films it's inspired by from Moon, The Shinning and Alien just to name a few. Martin Sheens android has a scene where he malfunctions which is very reminiscent to Alien. The obvious one of course is 2001: A Space Odyssey, from the rotating corridors and the overall set designs. The first half is great, the middle section is okay and the third act falls flat leaving you waiting for more as it wraps up too suddenly. Overall Passengers is a good way to pass 2 hours of your time.",
         "I had really great expectations for this movie, and maybe that's the reason why I was so disappointed. Of course, all the actors are great, and even though the direction is not bad, it's really a typical love movie scenario, with the doubt at the beginning, the intense love, the betrayal, and finally the traditional happy ending. That could've been good without all the inconsistencies there are. For example, why didn't they thought to resurrect the captain, just as Aurora did for Jim? And there was enough place for both of them in the end. It would be Titanic all over again if Rose had decided to stay in the water with Jack. Not a bad movie, some ideas are great : leaving a man alone with his thoughts and robots to see his attitude evolve is interesting, the fact that he sacrificed a life instead of staying alone too, but those ideas could've been pushed so much further if they did not decided to focus on their love story. Honorable mention to Arthur, the best character in my opinion.",
         "The first half is incredibly boring. Nothing happens for half of the movie. I understand that we need to \"feel\" the loneliness. But there are so many good movies that portrayed the Robinson experience without being also boring. And then: completely unrealistic on each level, on each detail (maybe apart from the love story, which is cute and romantic). This is not supposed to be fantasy or adventure. It is supposed to be a pure-blood SF story, whose main character is a mechanical engineer. So I expect that at least most of the technical details should hold a little water, as well as the main story line. But no: every little technical/scientific/engineering detail is completely illogical, and the methods deployed by the main character to solve the situations are absurd. Look: my motorbike has, I believe, around 5 completely different methods to stop the engine in case of emergency (cut the contact, cut the electricity, cut the gas, put it into neutral etc); but a huge stellar ship has: NONE ? A huge stellar ship the size of a village (5270 inhabitants) has only 1 (one) bed in the infirmary ? No sensor detects for 2 years that there is an open hole in the hull of the ship, and loss of pressure in some rooms ?! There is no backup system for anything \u2013 instead they repeat \"this system is supposed to be impossible to break, so this cannot happen\" \u2013 gosh I don't remember any engineering 101 lesson to ever say this line, they all speak of redundancy, backup, fail-safe and fail-over mechanisms. The individual space costume resists the heat of a reactor that would otherwise break the hull of the whole spaceship ?! There is absolutely no method to alert the large sleeping crew of a huge ship that something went wrong ?! There is no alarm system on a huge space ship ? My car has a better information collecting system from various sensors than that space ship, you actually DON'T need to plug-in floppy-disks around your car to collect data, they kind of get collected automatically and displayed on the screen. And if something stops, you still have the history of what happened before, stored in some central memory chip. Airplanes today have 2 independent black boxes to store everything that happens on board, all information from all sensors, any sound etc; for a space ship they just forget about this. For a space ship I would actually add maybe 3 or 5 different independent backup storage devices, plus maybe 2 or 3 backup computing devices, stored in completely different physical locations, completely independent, each one able to resume operation automatically and instantly if another one fails and maybe other 1 or 2 of them manually. Also: an intelligent passenger decides to solve a complex problem himself alone, instead of waking up like the whole 250 engineering crew of the ship. OK, we all expect a couple of goofs in any standard reasonable SF movie, it is difficult to keep track of all details and even good movies miss things. But when you hear a stupid idea every couple of minutes for the entire half of the movie when something actually happens, then the movie is crap. Good pictures though, loved the graphical effects. And the final completely weird finale to put the cherry on top: what is one young loving beautiful heterosexual couple expected to do alone, their entire lifetime, on a spaceship with 5000 vacant seats available ?... I would have said \"children\". Well, guess what: they decided to just plant a lot of trees.",
         "My initial thoughts after first seeing the trailer for Passengers was that it was a gross excuse to put Hollywood's two hottest actors on screen together. I saw that the critics had given this abysmal reviews and I wasn't surprised. I was however surprised to see that user reviews contradicted what critics had to say. Reviews contained descriptors like unexpected, great acting, suspense and the like. Well let me tell you this film was none of those. Passengers was forgettable. It wasn't bad, it wasn't good, it just was. Like I said, nothing more than an excuse to have studly guy and sexy girl on screen and cash some cheques while they were at it. The visuals were meh, the acting was passable, the script was something a fourth grader could have written. I feel like I've seen this movie 100 times in some different form. I'm only writing this to detract from the other user reviews that say to ignore what the critics are saying. Though it's not terrible it DEFINITELY isn't worth going out to see.",
         "Spoilers! In this movie, passengers Jim's hibernation pod malfunctions. He spends a year in utter loneliness until he decides to wake up another passenger. Jennifer Lawrence is spectacular in this movie. It reminded me of why I love her so much. She's just so talented and really brings on the emotion. The scenes where she was upset and unhappy or excited and delighted I really felt it all with her. Honestly, she's just such a phenomenal actress and I really don't get why anyone thinks she's overrated. My favorite scenes are probably after Aurora finds out Jim woke her up. The raw emotion and feelings that I experience while watching is what makes Jennifer Lawrence so astounding. Chris Pratt is also incredible. The emotion he is able to invoke in viewers is incredible. I loved him in Jurassic World and Guardians of the Galaxy, and in Passengers he does just as well. A movie with such a small cast needs actors who can deliver. And deliver they did. The other members of the cast include Lawrence Fishburne and Michael Sheen. I haven't really seen any of their movies before (at least none that I can remember) but they were both pretty damn outstanding in the movie. I love the story of the movie, it feels original and exciting. So why is this movie so unpopular with critics? I mean the cast is fantastic and the story feels incredibly original. I mean honestly, with critics, there is really nothing to worry about. Critics will dislike everything for absolutely no justifiable reason, and for movies, critics represents the tiny insignificant minority (ouch, right?). Who cares about critics? We should start a revolution against them because honestly no one cares anymore. Some of the best movies have the worst critic ratings. Some critics think their job is to find everything wrong with something and rant about it. What's more important is the people who actually see the movie, who make up the vast majority of moviegoers. Critics are literally insignificant really. I was surprised to see that some people said that Passengers was misogynistic with a flawed story. I have to say that I strongly disagree. The idea of Passengers is about a man stranded alone on a ship, destined to die. The movie examines the human condition. The loneliness he feels is unquestionable (at one point he is close to committing suicide.) Jon Sphaits (the writer) wrote a script that asks the important and difficult questions. What would you do? Like they say in the movie, Jim is very similar to a drowning man, he will do anything he thinks will save him. Loneliness causes him to wake up another passenger. And this movie I felt dealt with it appropriately. And I am not trying to justify his actions, because they are undoubtedly wrong, however, I strongly believe that everyone would've done the same thing had they been in the same situation. Besides the fact that Jim redeems himself in the end by allowing Aurora the choice she was never given.",
         "It's not a spoiler to say that in the first minutes of the film we get a bird's eye view of the ship colliding head on with an asteroid swarm. Don't ask why this incredibly complicated ship couldn't/didn't attempt any evasive maneuvers. In any case the ship's automated systems are only partially successful in dealing with it, the sequence of events ending with one of the passengers being awakened prematurely from his hibernation pod. It's also important to know before the curtain goes up that the passengers are not astronauts, they literally are just passengers on a space-borne cruise ship which is taking 5,000 people on a 120-year journey to colonize a new world. If you can suspend disbelief long enough you will be very entertained."

         "A company offers people the opportunity to leave the Earth and live on a new colony called Homestead 2. They are being transported on a space vessel called the Avalon. The journey takes 120 years so the travelers and crew are kept in hibernation chambers while the ship flies on its own and are to be awaken just before they arrive. When one passenger -Jim Preston - is awoken, he goes around the ship he discovers he's the only one awake, having been woken 90 years early. He tries to reenter his hibernation pod but can't, and spends the next year by himself. He looks at the videos of the other passengers and one, Aurora Lane, intrigues him. He then has to decide if he should wake her up. Eventually he does and they try to make the best of their time together. But then they realise; something must've happened to the ship for it to awaken him, and they set out to find out what it is.",
