Out of a chance, his path crosses that of Curtis, played by Ryan Reynolds, who joins the same poker table at a run-of-the-mill casino in Illinois. They met again, by coincidence, at a local bar, where a friendship starts to form over drinks and stories. It doesn\u2019t take Gerry long to form a conclusion - good things happen around Curtis. Enchanted by his new \u2018lucky charm\u2019 friend, and in an act of final desperation, Gerry throws Curtis an absurd proposal; lend him some cash, hit the road, hit the casinos, win a fortune, split it, live happily ever after; and enjoy the ride along the way._\r\n",

         "Mississippi Grind is a very enjoyable film. Gerry (Ben Mendelsohn) and Curtis (Ryan Reynolds, the spitting image of Ben Affleck--so much so you may watch this and think it WAS Ben playing the role), embark on a gambling road trip much like the characters in Sideways embark on a wine tasting tour. Although the result isn't as funny as Sideways, it's just as engaging in it's depiction of two lost souls male bonding with each other. They have their ups and downs and despite how the characters are depicted it remains ambiguous who is ultimately the wiser. Although fans of gambling movies will surely enjoy this character study, at the end of the day it's the acting that pulls this through and makes the two hours go by without a dull moment, even though action is scarce and human interaction is the main theme. I enjoyed it and recommend it.",
         "This is right up my alley. I enjoy gambling films, and like both actors. \"Mississippi Grind\" is a great film bolstered by the chemistry and performances of the two leads. The film steady rolls out of the gate. Like the Mississippi itself, it doesn't seem to be in a hurry, but it keeps rolling towards it's destination. This is not a film of twists, cons, or gimmicks. It's a realistic examination of two gambling addicts, who find friendship and success despite their differences and problems. Mendelsohn gives an Oscar worthy performance. \"Gerry's\" life has been permanently scarred because of his addiction. Think of William H. Macy in \"The Cooler\", or Philip Seymour Hoffman in \"Owning Mahoney\" and then up the ante(and that's saying something - especially the latter). I doubt he'll actually get a nomination. I already knew this was one of the best lesser- known actors in Hollywood. I'd seen many Australian films starring Mendelsohn, but many might recognize him from his supporting roles in films like \"Place Beyond the Pines\", and \"Black Sea\". This performance should catapult him into some bigger roles in American film. Here Mendelsohn can't seem to get out of the way of himself. He's fallen so far that he believes that he deserves every bad thing that comes his way, yet he still can't stop his actions. It's like any addiction. There's usually a good person underneath there, but unfortunately, the weight of all his transgressions needs to be lifted before there is any chance at redemption. But, can the weight ever be lifted? I think that's the open-ended message and question at the end of the film. That's also why the ending works so well. It takes such a depressing character, two of them actually, and leaves us with the thought that they can right every wrong. Mendelsohn's \"gerry\" also has a somewhat likable, light-hearteded quality in his depressive state. It's magical really. You'll leave the film thinking that you may run into Gerry at your regional casino; passing by and casually saying, \"Hey Gerry\". \"Hey Man\" he'd quietly reply, wondering possibly worrying about where he knew you from as he headed to the poker room. The only thing that separates these two characters, is luck. Nothing more. Each of them imprint on one another, and the result is a revelation for them both. They need each other. Gerry needs Curtis' luck, and Curtis needs Gerry to justify that he can turn his own personal life around, that people like them can make a good decision. Proof that it's not all luck. Proof that he can quit and machu pichu(have to see it). Highly recommended. Sitting right with \"Wild Tales\" for my top film of 2015, granted I've only seen 27 of 80 on my watchlist. As Gerry might say \"It's a Sign\" that better movies might lie ahead. You'll like this if you liked: Trees Lounge(not as good), Owning Mahoney(very close but not quite as good as this), The Cooler(not as good), or Rounders(close but not as good, though I'm sure the comparison and statement won't help the useful %).",
         "Movies like these simply don't come around too often. MISSISSIPPI GRIND follows in a long tradition of great gambling movies such as Altman's California SPLIT and Toback's THE GAMBLER, but easily stands up next to them as one of the finest examples of the genre. Ben Mendelsohn is at a career best level in this movie, approaching Pacino-in-the-70s heights at times. If you have followed his work since his breakout role in ANIMAL KINGDOM, his performance here will feel like a culmination of one hell of a run in the 2010's. Mendelsohn plays Gerry, a great poker player but a terrible gambler. His inability to know when to walk away from the table has put him deep into debt with some very unsavory characters, and even if he had the money to pay them back, he might just gamble it away anyways. This is the kind of self-destructive guy we're following here. He meets Curtis (Ryan Reynolds, the good version we also saw in ADVENTURELAND), a younger, seemingly more put together gambling enthusiast who clearly has issues of his own, and they form an unlikely but surprisingly endearing bond. Curtis agrees to stake Gerry a few grand and drive him down the Mississippi River, hitting a bunch of riverboat games on their way to a high stakes poker game in New Orleans. So the film also becomes a road movie, and a fantastic addition to that canon as well. The movie turns simply on watching these characters play out their fates, and the directing team of Boden & Fleck (who also made the great HALF NELSON and SUGAR) capture their lives with sensitivity and a good eye for emotions lurking just beneath the surface. We don't quite know what compels Curtis to help Gerry, nor do we know what compels Gerry to make some of the decisions he makes once they hit the road, but the filmmakers aren't interested in explaining flawed humanity to us. They are primarily interested in emotional truth, and boy do they find it in this story. Highly recommended for those who prefer finely tuned character dramas.",
         "Wow, I have to say that I am very impressed with Ryan Reynolds after watching this. I have never been a huge fan of the guy, and tbh he isn't even this best actor in this movie, but his performance in this movie was so good and surprising that it's worth being the first thing I mention about this flick. So now that I am done gushing we can start talking about this film. It's dark, gritty, and even a little humorous at times. There were a few scenes that were almost hard to watch, not because they were overly violent or grotesque, but because you really felt like you were feeling the characters pain. I really got sucked into this one, and by the time the credits rolled I had a feeling in my gut that this movie will probably stick with me for a while. Don't get me wrong, this isn't a masterpiece, it has its flaws, but it just does such a good job at being exactly what it wants to be. The story is anything spectacular or new but it's story that had me very interested until the final scene because it felt so real. I definitely suggest checking this one out, one of the better movies I have seen in a while. 8/10",
         "A smaller film coming out this year, Mississippi Grind turned out to be a rally great entertaining movie. I wasn't expecting much out of this movie to be honest, a gambler with an addiction who needs money and meets a charming Ryan Reynolds could be good, or trash, but it was great. The cast for this movie was the thing that peaked my interest the most. Having seen Ben Mendelsohn do great things in Starred Up and Slow West, I was interested to see him play this character. Also Ryan Reynolds is an actor I love and this is his last movie before the upcoming Deadpool film, so I wanted to see glimpses of that if possible. That is exactly what happened! The chemistry between Curtis (Ryan Reynolds) and Gerry (Ben Mendelsohn) was beautiful. The performances of the two where really good as well, in particular Mendelsohn in very key parts of the movie. Throughout the film I wanted these guys to win and keep winning. However, not a perfect film by far, had some moments especially toward the end which bothered me slightly but nothing that ruined the whole movie for me. This is definitely a smaller film so I recommend checking it out, worth your time if you are tired of bigger budget movies.",
         "Huge gambling film fan here. Let it Ride is one of my all time favorite comedies and I loved both the James Caan and Mark Wahlberg Gambler films, Big Hand For the Little Lady, Hustler,The Sting, Color of Money, Hard Eight , Rounders, The Cincinatti Kid and 21 all films I found better than this. I came to the film for Ben Mendelsohn whom I have been a huge fan of since seeing the great \"Animal Kingdom\". He does not disappoint. This also is perhaps the best work that I have seen Ryan Reynolds do. It is a road trip film that some are comparing to Sideways, but the script just feels flat. It held my interest. It is worth seeing, but it really could have had a more compelling script. A lot of it may be that beyond the relationship between the two leads, none of the other characters really played out well or drew me in. I will say one thing. The sound track is classic. One of the best ever; full of Delta Blues and a host of songs that were oldies, but new to my ears. The soundtrack was a pure 10. Worth the price of admission alone.",
         "\"We can't lose.\" Gerry (Mendelsohn) is a down on his luck gambler and is in danger of losing everything. Just when he thinks he hits rock bottom he meets Curtis (Reynolds) and his luck begins to change. Faced with debts he can't pay back Gerry convinces Curtis to bankroll him during a road trip in order to win back his life. Along the way Gerry's luck again starts to change and he keeps digging himself into a deeper and deeper hole. Even though this is basically like all the other gambling movies that have come out lately I really enjoyed this one. Ryan Reynolds is a great choice as the smooth talking good luck charm and Mendelsohn plays the part of an on the edge addict that you feel sorry for and are angry at at the same time. That is a hard thing to pull off. The movie does keep you wondering what is going to happen and what Curtis' angle in this is. The entire movie leaves you feeling conflicted and you are never sure if you are happy for the characters or angry at them. That adds an extra dimension to the film that really helps it. Overall, a very good movie that gets better the more you watch. I did like this quite a bit. I give it a B.",
         "The movie stars two actors I've never heard of: Ben Mendelsohn and Ryan Reynolds. I characterize their roles as two irresponsible men who like to gamble to excess, drink too much, and hang out with women you wouldn't want to bring home and introduce to your parents. Gerry (Mendelsohn) never has much money because he doesn't stop gambling until he loses it all. He's a perpetual optimist who believes his next gambling venture will hit the jackpot. Lucas (Reynolds) tries to temper Gerry's gambling addiction to little avail. It's almost like the blind leading the blind. Much to the chagrin of Lucas, Gerry plays a cassette tape in his car that teaches the top two hundred visual cues to watch for in the facial expressions and body postures of your poker opponents. The tape plays as they drive to casinos in St Louis, Memphis, and New Orleans. The movie soundtrack includes some great blues and jazz music. Movie goers are sure to recognize locally popular landmarks that may not be nationally known. Gerry's persistent downward spiral made me wonder if he might harm himself physically. He's a likable guy with some really bad addictions he doesn't have the self discipline to control. Near the end of the movie I thought I knew what was coming next, but I was wrong. I really enjoyed this movie. It's a character study and could actually happen. It doesn't rely on special effects because it doesn't need any. Check your local listings for times and theaters, but hurry before it's gone.",
         "Mississippi Grind is nothing more then a slow burner with no substance. It lacks any for of entertainment and feels so out of place with its actor choices. Whilst an avid fan of poker and gambling as a whole, this film just didn't draw me into its buddy-up against the casino idea. Whilst at times, I will admit, the film ventures to a somewhat new and original place, it only sucker punches you back onto the track that it was going before. Not a good movie at all. The pacing is completely off and above all the script is above boring from start to finish. It feels weak, whilst also never giving the audience anytime to enjoy themselves. Nothing Ng more then a let down to a film I was going to give a shot and would like f hoped to enjoy.",
         "\"Mississippi Grind\" (2015 release; 108 min.) brings the story of two gamblers. As the movie opens, we see how a guy (we later learn his name is Gerry) walks into a local casino in Dubuque, Iowa. He must be a regular as everyone knows him. But at his poker table, there is one new face, a younger guy named Curtis. Gerry is in real estate and way down on his luck. Curtis oozes charm and confidence. They bit it off nicely, and on a whim, decide to drive to New Orleans to enter into a 'big game' (buy-in price is $25K). To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out. Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from writers-directors (and real life partners) Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck (they previously brought us \"It's Kind Of a Funny Story\"). Here they tackle the subject matter of gambling, and more precisely the addition to gambling. Combine that with the road movie angle, and you've got yourself an update to \"California Split\" of yesteryear. That aside, the movie is really a character study. Gerry (played by Ben Mendelsohn) is someone who you feel sorry for, although he is not quite the 'loveable loser'. At one point he goes to visit his ex-wife in Little Rock, and you can just feel the devastation set in when he learns she has remarried and didn't even tell him. Ryan Reynolds is perfect as the confidence-oozing Curtis. \"You'll be my lucky charm\" Gerry tells Curtis as they hit the road to New Orleans. Sienna Miller is okay as the love interest of Curtis. As mentioned, this is a road movie, and we get the best scenery from cities like St. Louis, Memphis, Little Rock, etc. Kudos also for the outstanding soundtrack, which features tons of 'old school' blues artists and songs. All that said, the sum of the parts don't measure up to the total of the movie, which lacks the compelling elements needed to pull me in. \"Mississippi Grind\" opened at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati this past weekend. The evening screening where I saw this at was surprisingly well attended, certainly for a week night. If you are in the mood for a character study about losers in life who are desperately trying to right the ship, \"Mississippi Grind\" isn't the best, but neither is it the worst. I'd suggest you check this out when you have a chance, be it in the theater, on Amazon Instant Video, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusions."
