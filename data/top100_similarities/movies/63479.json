      "synopsis": "Ian Lafferty (Josh Zuckerman) is an 18-year-old recent high school graduate. He searches for a girl online making it look as if he's buff and suave, although he's sweet and unassuming. He soon meets \"Ms. Tasty\" (Katrina Bowden) and agrees to meet her in person. She lives in Knoxville, while he lives in Brookfield. With his best friends Lance (Clark Duke) and Felicia (Amanda Crew), they go in a Pontiac GTO Judge borrowed without permission from Ian's arrogant homophobic older brother Rex (James Marsden). On the way to Knoxville, they come across a hitchhiker (David Koechner), as the radiator in the Judge overheats. They attempt urinating in the radiator, which only works briefly as they try to leave the hitchhiker in the dust. The hitchhiker, frustrated at Ian's lack of concern for his well being, leaves. As Ian and Felicia wander to find help, Lance is waiting with the car as Ezekiel (Seth Green) happens by in his horse-drawn buggy. Ezekiel and his Amish buddies repair the car while they join a Rumspringa party where Fall Out Boy is playing a concert and at which Lance meets an attractive Amish girl, Mary (Alice Greczyn). The three promise to come again on the way back to do some work in return. They go to jail due to Ian throwing a tire iron into a state trooper car (due to his increasing frustration at trying to put a possum he hit out its misery), and are released after Mary pays the bail. They find a hotel that sports a wide variety of role playing rooms. Rex arrives angrily and insists that they go back and that Ian cannot visit Ms. Tasty. After Ian pretends to be gay, Rex allows him to see Ms. Tasty, hoping this encounter will change Ian's mind. Ian finally meets Ms. Tasty, However, when he tells her about Felicia, her seduction for Ian to take off his clothes becomes a threat as her psychotic boyfriend Bobby Jo (Dave Sheridan) puts a gun to Ian's head. It becomes apparent that the couple work at a chop shop and attempts to rob Rex's Pontiac GTO. During the comic confrontation, Ian manages to save Felicia, who then is able to run off and report to the police. Ms. Tasty tries to escape, but is stopped by Andy and Randy, two students from Ian's high school she failed to manipulate. Bobby Jo, on the other hand, is treated after being shot by Ian in self defense. Felicia tells the police about the chop shop location and the couple is arrested. In the end, Lance refuses to come back home, decides he prefers Amish life, and stays behind to marry Mary, while Ian and Felicia realize their love for each other. On New Year's Eve Ian gives his virginity to Felicia. It is also revealed Rex's homophobia stemmed from the fact that he was hiding his own homosexuality. In the final frame of the film, a picture is shown of Lance and Mary being married, accompanied by Ian and Felicia. He's shown sporting a beard much like Ezekiel. A clip of Ezekiel and Fall Out Boy arguing over the fact that the Amish fixed Fall Out Boy's tour bus for just \"a five song set\" in form of compensation serves as a running gag during the credits of the film.",

         "I saw Sex Drive at a sneak preview presented by my university. It's a seemingly typical teen sex comedy in the vein of Superbad meets Road Trip. Zuckerman plays Ian, a young virgin with no luck with the ladies, a crush on his childhood friend Felicia (Crew), a jerk of an older brother (Marsden), and is best friends with an Austin Powers-esquire Casanova by the name of Lance (Duke). On the internet, he poses as a football player while courting a mysterious girl online. When the girl invites him to go \"all the way\", he steals his brother's GTO and heads to Knoxville with Felicia and Lance. Ian's character has the usual nerdy teen virgin-in-a-movie problems: falls for the wrong girls, takes few risks, gets caught in embarrassing sexual situations. On the road trip, they run into a series of hilarious, awkward, and weird situations. And on the way, they discover that sex isn't the most important thing, and that true love can be found in both odd and familiar places. It's not exactly stunningly original, but it's still a hilarious film. The three leads do a pretty good job, Lance being a particularly funny character. Marsden and Green steal the show in all the scenes they're in, and all of the characters in the film are interesting, even if most of them are stock characters. The script is also well-connected, with most of the characters being connected to the larger plot, and combines wit, ribaldry, and straight adult humor well. Every gag sequence gets big laughs, and the comedy never slows down or dies out. The internet cut-aways are especially hilarious supplements. It's refreshing to see a genuinely adult comedy not coming from the Apatow crew or McKay and Ferrell. Although it lacks star leads and filmmakers and will probably drop under the radar, I definitely recommend Sex Drive to anyone looking for a big laughs.",
         "There are several people who say that critics don't know anything... I find it funny in Hollywood how the best movies get rated terribly, and have a 28% rating on rottentomatoes 'tomatometer'... I saw the preview for Sex Drive on myspace. The preview started off as a typical drive-across-the-country crazy-things-happen teen sex party movie. About halfway into the trailer I found myself laughing... and thinking \"wow... something about this movie feels different. I think it's going to be really good. I don't want to wait til October, I want to watch it right now\". THREE WEEKS later three of my friends and I decided to see a last minute movie- I looked up Sex Drive only to find that it was only playing in one theater in our entire city (Denver) with only one showtime! 10:30 was the only showtime, if this was any indication of how the movie was I figured that it was going to be terrible- but I remembered how much I enjoyed the preview and coerced my friends to go see it. When we arrived the theater had only two other people in it, both middle-aged males sitting separately by themselves. Again- not a good sign... The movie started out, and was instantly funny. We laughed, so did the others. I thought, \"ok, any movie can make people laugh... it's not that hard a thing to do... let's see where this goes\". The movie continued on, and I found myself loving the plot. Loving the script. Loving the (no-name) actors. Loving the directing. Loving the editing. Loving everything about it. But that's just me... everyone has different opinions. My three friends (who- might I mind you, have very different senses of humor) all felt the exact same way. We were crying at certain parts because we were laughing so hard. The other (two) people in the theater were laughing hysterically as well. Just when I thought it couldn't get any better- the movie turns to a love story, and everything throughout the whole movie comes together. It finally ended, and I, and my three friends, sat there, in awe, about what we just saw. We left the theater and could not have been any happier about our movie choice. I returned home to instantly look up reviews online about what others thought of this movie- and it blew my mind. The most terrible, awful things were said, and the movie's gross domestic total? $8,402,485. A BOMB. I don't understand what it is people are looking for in a comedy. I will agree with others and say- yes, this has been done before. Yes, this movie is exactly what I thought it would be and what I wrote above (a typical drive-across-the-country crazy-things-happen teen sex party movie). Yes, this movie is predictable and familiar- but back to the question- what is it people are looking for in a comedy? This movie had every element of the $100,000,000+/movie American Pie series. Sex Drive should of made AT LEAST half that much. I saw College recently- NOW THIS is a movie that deserved it's abysmal earnings of 4.5 million dollars. College's jokes were cheap, and seemingly desperate, as if almost begging for a laugh. And once again- yes, College made me (slightly) laugh- as I said before any comedy can- but what it did not do was leave me with a feeling of sheer joy and happiness that I took the time out of my night (and life) to watch it. Sex Drive left me with this feeling. I believed Sex Drive to be perfect. In every aspect. I will address that, again, everyone's taste is different; everyone's brains interpret things differently and because of this not everyone will find Sex Drive to be perfect, in fact some may not find it funny it all- but I believe THE MAJORITY of people (9 out of 10) will realize, upon DVD release and word-of-mouth, that Sex Drive was the sleeper hit of 2008. See this movie. It deserves much more money than it made and is well, well worth your time.",
         "So there was a screening of Sex Drive at the theatre, so I thought \"what the hell?\" From the preview, I thought it could have gone one of three ways: 1. A horrible attempt at an R-rated comedy in the same fashion of a pretty good comedy a decade ago. (Like College tried for American Pie, and failed) 2. A mediocre R-rated comedy with bits here and there. 3. A movie that knows what it's going for and hits its mark. I would have to say, this movie is very close to #3. The movie isn't a great movie, but it has no delusions on what it is. With the plot of a guy driving cross state just to get some ass, there's not a lot of directions you can go with it. The makers know this, so they make the best of it. No real need to stress much on the story. It's simple, basic, predictable. Bad? I wouldn't say that. The story is really more of a momentum pusher than anything. It's really only there to prevent this from being a series of jokes and gags just jumbled together. There's no real big twist, a few lessons to be taken form it, but they all have been done before. You can pretty much tell what's going to happen at the end within the first 15 minutes. But the story isn't really the important thing here, so no real points taken off for that. All the actors are good. Clichéd, yes, but they are likable. The goofy, virgin lead guy who's trying to get some tail is played wonderfully by Josh Zuckerman. Pulls it off flawlessly with all the awkwardness and uncertainty that the character would have. Amanda Crew is also really good at the \"BFF\" of Josh's character. The two have pretty good chemistry, even with all their awkwardly close moments. It isn't perfect, but being in some of those awkward situations, they were (while pushed a bit) familiar. A surprise is James Marsden. You may remember him as Cyclops from X-Men, and he pulls off a great punk-ass older brother with a sense of humor of his own. He is the typical ass hole older brother in these kind of movies, but he pulls it over very well. Seth Green just seems like he's cruising through the movie. I think he's got a lot of talent and I knew even if the movie was going to be bad, he would provide a good set of laughs. And as a sarcastic Amish engineer genius, he's just fits in this movie seamlessly. But I have to give a lot of credit to Clark Duke. His first real movie. He was a party extra in Superbad, if I'm not mistaken, the one who called McLovin' a bad ass. Like Seth Green, he just seems to glide through. He also has great chemistry with Josh Zuckerman. You can tell the two of them just had a really good time together on this. He is the suave ladies man who's guiding his pathetic best friend on his verge of losing his virginity, while getting some action himself. He doesn't have the look of the typical character, but he pulls it off excellently. I put a lot of emphasis on the characters and actors. They were the backbone of the movie. Not the story, but the characters. There's also a hand full of supporting characters that do a good job at their parts, and an unwelcome (well, for me it was unwelcome) appearance by Fall Out Boy. There are few things worse than a comedy that's not funny. There have been a serious excess of those as well. Dane Cook just had a movie a few weeks ago, and that was a haggard piece of crap. I actually have to say though, I laughed quite a bit in this movie. With the plot, there are going to be quite a few of the sex jokes, involving spooge, penises and homosexuality. Most of them though actually delivered. I can't actually say there were too many flat moments with the jokes. Yes, there were some, but the jokes that worked out-weighed those that didn't. The climax got really over-the-top, but it did continue on with the laughs, and was satisfying. The closure did take a bit longer than necessary, but didn't drag. The movie was actually well paced and I was never bored. This is no Superbad. It's not anywhere in that league. I walked out of this movie saying \"This is 2000's Road Trip.\" No, Road Trip wasn't a masterpiece or one of those comedy powerhouses, but it was really good for what it was going for. An over-the-top, R-rated comedy. See it with a group of friends in the theatre. Definitely see it with a crowd, it will probably make it that much more enjoyable. 3.75/5 Also, if you saw the trailer and had no interest, then you probably would want to skip it. It has it's intended audience, and will probably please those people and few others.",
         "I loved every minute of this movie!! If you are looking for a non-stop constantly-falling-out-of-your-seat film, then Sex Drive is perfect for you. It is an instant teen comedy classic, in my books. James Mardsen and Seth Green steals the show but up and coming actors: Josh Zuckerman and Clark Duke did extremely well for themselves and prove themselves to be the next big thing in the future. It is just about as funny than Superbad and American Pie (1,2,3) and the plot of the movie was just so simple and well-made. Hopefully, Sex Drive will be a teen classic in the next few years because it's extremely funny, raunchy & has a little bit of it's sweet side, too. Sex Drive is awesome and super hilarious!!!",
         "I couldn't bash \"Sex Drive\" in good faith. For a comedy of its type, and all of you know what I mean by this coming of age sort of comedy, it had a lot of slow parts that weren't funny, and needless sentimentality that only served to slow the movie down. However, when it was funny, it was super funny. The ongoing gags were pretty notable, and performances were top notch, notably by Seth Green as the sarcastic Amish guy. This may reign as best sarcastic performance in any movie, ever. The energy between the various performers was right and helped execute most of the gags effectively. As I mentioned, I have complaints, but they are trivial. If you want some goofy humor to eat popcorn to, give it a shot.",
         "I mostly thought that all of the great comedies were done for the year after the summer ended. This summer 2008 was truly a great time for comedy with movies such as Step Brothers, Tropic Thunder, Pineapple Express, etc. My thoughts were changed though when I saw this movie. This was arguably in the same category as those movies. It is easily one of the funniest movies of 2008. It really reminds you of road movies in the late decade such as Road Trip, Euro Trip, etc. and delivers the normal Superbad kind of content. Josh Zuckerman did a really great job in his first starring role that I have seen him in. Seth Green is in this as well and he nearly delivers a ton of laughs in this movie. This is worth it for those who like the usual teen sex kind of comedy. 9/10",
         "When I went to see Sex Drive I was half expecting most of the film to be a continuous romp. Boy was I surprised. It is packed with jokes from start to finish that should appeal to a large number of people. The level of the acting is one thing I will compliment. The actors seem to be enjoying themselves (I wonder why? Ho Hum). At some points I did feel that things where a little stupid such as a couple of the sex scenes. Sex Drive is a hilarious movie that can be throughly enjoyed by nearly anyone.",
         "Okay, so, Sex Drive: It's rude, it's certainly crude, but is it actually in any way good? That's the question that faces many teenage comedies of similar nature these days; so very often over the past decade, the answer unfortunately has been a resounding and overwhelming 'no', but there always remains a select few reminders that even the dumbest of comedies can still thrive upon just that. Sex Drive is thankfully one of these films. It's outrageous and ridiculous in its portrayal of teenage romance, filled with characters that speak more broadly as caricature than real, definable human beings, but it all works \u0096for the most part- in the favour of its silly, edgy routine. Sure enough, it's a film that is far more likely to put a smile on the younger faces of the audience, but that assessment goes without saying; in short, there's some good fun to be had here, but only if you don't mind the gross-out variants of humour and can appreciate the comedy on its own merits. Expect anything more than that, and you'll be disappointed. For all intents and purposes, Sex Drive rarely ever strays far from the road of teenage rom-coms. Taking place for the most part on the open road where many comedians make brief cameo appearances as wacky characters that bump into the main cast, the narrative that binds Sex Drive's gags together is something that has been done to death. In this vein, the movie can get tiresome\u0097and at 110 minutes long, the biggest flaw becomes the sometimes meandering, directionless pace of which moves the plot along. Sure enough such sprawling pit-stops are usually followed by a series of great, laugh out loud bursts of humour, but this incessant need to fill up space needlessly makes Sex Drive feel like a much longer drive than it actually is. That being said, despite the formulated, familiar approach to this road trip story, Anders and Morris do well to capitalise on the stronger elements of such a narrative. The cameos never feel redundant and fabricated; the trip itself gives way to some great comical situations; and characters, believe it or not, actually grow (albeit, very slowly) over the course of the journey. Furthermore, behind all the profane, raunchy sex jokes and slapstick lies a straight forward, but nevertheless engaging unrequited love story that doesn't feel tacked on and as derivative as it plays out on page. It's a romance that never quite takes off, but with decent characterisation and performances from those involved, it's enough to give the story a warm core that pays out with an ending befitting of your average genre movie. To watch a movie like Sex Drive for the romance however, is a bit like eating a hot dog for the bun; the real drawing power and force of conviction that draws you into the surreal, ridiculous world displayed here is through the characters, and the awkward, downright hilarious jams they get themselves into. For the most part, the movie strikes gold most when the comedy is just that\u0097character driven\u0097and it's always fun to watch lead character Ian (Josh Zuckerman) constantly get into uncomfortable, cringe-inducing moments of embarrassment. Of course, a lot of such moments succeed primarily upon the clever, rat-a-tat, teenage colloquial dialogue that Anders and Morris accentuate through their script, but a lot of it also comes down to the performances of the cast who bring their characters to life vividly and with shades of naturalism that brings out the script's modern, laid back feel. As a result, Sex Drive all the more feels casual, and while this again reinforces the slack attitude devoted to the meandering pacing, such a style works well to give the movie a personality of its own that reflects its characters. In the end, although I had some qualms with the movie's runtime, and it's sometimes unfocused approach to narrative, I nevertheless had fun with what Sean Anders delivers here. It's a relentlessly convincing picture with a youthful vision that many directors so often forget or simply neglect to touch upon when making such movies. As a result, Sex Drive will undoubtedly speak a lot clearer to younger audience members than their older counterparts, but if you happen to be a part of that demographic, then there is definitely some great laughs to be had here; unabashedly immature and not afraid to get dirty, Sex Drive is a long ride, but it's worth it in the end for the fun that it expels over that trip. - A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)",
         "In the suburb of Chicago, the eighteen year-old Ian (Josh Zuckerman) is a naive and virgin teenager that is mocked by his homophobic brother Rex (James Marsden) and his schoolmates; his best friends are Felicia (Amanda Crew) and the wolf Lance (Clark Duke). When Ian meets a girl called Tasty (Katrina Bowden) in Internet, he writes many lies about himself; when she invites him to drive to Knoxville, Tennessee, to have sex with her, Ian steals Rex's GTO Judge 1969 and travels with Lance and Felicia. When they have trouble on the road with the car, the Amish Ezekiel (Seth Green) offers to help them in his community. Lance meets the Amish Mary (Alice Greczyn) and they fall in love for each other. During their travel, Ian and Felicia discover that their feelings are more than friendship and that Tasty is not who she told she is. I am still laughing with \"Sex Drive\" since this movie is one of the funniest comedies that I have recently seen. There are many gross jokes, beautiful tits and girls and enjoyable characters. The cynical Seth Green is simply hilarious in the role of a sympathetic Amish. The scene when Ian is on the stage watching the dancers backstage while a pregnant girl is telling her sad story is so funny that I needed to stop the movie just to laugh. The last scene with Amanda Crew in the end of the credits is also very funny, and I believe many people probably lost this joke. If you are intellectual, or if you do not like this type of movie, please do not spend your time to write bad reviews in IMDb. I can not understand how a viewer can be surprised with the content of a comedy that begins the way \"Sex Drive\" does. Amanda Crew, Katrina Bowden, Alice Greczyn and all the female cast are incredibly gorgeous. My vote is eight. Title (Brazil): \"Sex Drive\"",
         "The name \"Sex Drive\" may awake false expectations for some viewers prior to watching. The movies goes beyond the typical \"american-pie-like-comedy-style\" and shows a sensitive development of relationships which were not expected at the beginning. These developments are combined with several road-trip experiences and different (of course, also sexual) experiences during the trip. But the film contains more than that, it has a nice plot, a stringent story and very talented young actors. It is definitely not just a teenage-flick, it is much more. Because despite some laughs, funny moments ( \"amish\") and unexpected action - we experience beautiful acting of Amanda Crew who didn't appear to me that intense in other movies before (like Final Destination for example). She does not only look beautiful but acts in a very authentic way, it seems to me like she enjoyed the set, the whole idea of the movie, and the acting in it especially (though the film had its rather crude moments at the beginning and in the step-mother appearances). I admit that this was one of the best teenage-road-movies I've seen in the last decade. Not only because it shows the lifestyle everybody would have loved to live in its teenage years, it also features both laughs and unexpected developments in the end, thoughts about the meaning of love and how important it is to trust feelings. A closer look at the character of Ian would have been great because during the whole movie he seemed a bit inapproachable, and we don't get an impression about his development of feelings towards Felicia, only the other way round. Summary: Funny movie with a very nice development in the end, and a fascinating and breath-taking Amanda Crew - worth watching!"

         "Ian is a high school senior in suburban Chicago, plagued by being a virgin. Online he's inflated his resume, met Ms. Tasty, and agreed to drive to Knoxville where she promises sex. He steals his homophobic, macho brother's GTO, and, with his two best friends, Lance and Felicia, heads south. Every young woman who meets Lance, including Felicia, is attracted to him, as he practices his aptly learned \"Pick-Up Artist\" skills. Ian, on the other hand, is a decent guy who wouldn't mind if his friendship with Felicia became a romance. By the time they get to Knoxville, they have encountered a jealous boyfriend, a menacing hitchhiker, jail birds, carjackers, an Amish community, and Ian's better judgment.",
