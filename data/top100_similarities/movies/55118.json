      "synopsis": "The film begins on a rainy night in London. A young Turkish youth named Ekrem (Josef Altin) walks into Azim's barber shop, where Azim (Mina E. Mina) is cutting the hair of Soyka (Aleksandar Mikic) a Russian man. Ekrem locks the door, closes the shades, and changes the sign from open to closed. He is Azim's nephew and is introduced to Soyka, but he gets extremely nervous. Azim gives his nephew a razor blade, and urges him to follow through on their plan. Soyka realizes whats going on, and tries to leave but is held down. Ekrem slits Soyka's throat, causing him to suffer painfully before he dies. Elsewhere, a dazed young Russian girl named Tatiana (Sarah-Jeanne Labrosse) walks barefoot into a convenience store and asks for help. The clerk assumes that she's a drug seeker, and then blood starts to flow down her legs. Tatiana collapses, and is taken to the hospital. The doctors see that she's pregnant, and perform surgery to save the baby. Tatiana dies, while the baby lives. A nurse, Anna (Naomi Watts), announces the death and looks after the baby. Anna goes home and gets some sleep. She lives with her mother Helen (Sinead Cusack) and her Russian uncle Stepan (Jerzy Skolimowski). On Christmas day, Helen wakes up Anna for breakfast. Stepan is reading a diary in the dining room, and asks her where she got it. Anna says that she took it off of the dead girl. He says that she's stealing from the dead, and that the dead girl's secrets should be buried with her. She wants him to translate the diary, since its in Russian, but he refuses. While skimming through the pages, Anna comes across a business card for a Trans-Siberian restaurant. Anna rides her motorcycle to the restaurant, and parks in front. Nikolai (Viggo Mortensen) and Kirill (Vincent Cassel) walk through an alley, joking around, when they see Anna securing her (Russian) Ural motorcycle. They both eye her, and then Kirill orders Nikolai to retrieve Azim and his wife, and bring them to the restaurant. Nikolai drives off, and Kirill enters the restaurant. Anna knocks on the door, and its answered by the manager Semyon (Armin Mueller-Stahl), who's also Kirill's father. Semyon tells Anna that the restaurant is closed, but she tells him that she's a midwife and wants to speak to him about Tatiana. He allows her to enter after she tells him her last name, and they walk through the restaurant while Anna notices that all the workers are getting ready for a big party (while also noticing Kirill drinking at the bar). Semyon notices a couple of little girls playing the violin, but he tells them to be better and shows them by playing a tune. Anna shows Semyon the business card, and he tells her that it's an old one, and that he doesn't know Tatiana. She might have just eaten there once and liked the food, which Semyon has Anna taste. Anna wishes to find out where Tatiana's family lived, but he claims he doesn't know. He's sorry that he couldn't be of more help, and she tells him that shell probably find out more when she gets her diary translated. Semyon volunteers to translate the diary himself, and tells her to bring it to him tomorrow night. Before she leaves, Semyon makes sure to know where she works. Outside, Nikolai pulls up to the restaurant with Azim and his wife. He stays outside by his car, which is parked right next to Anna's motorcycle. Anna comes out and he compliments her on the motorcycle. She says that it belonged to her father, and he asks if she'd be interested in selling it. She says that it holds sentimental value to her, and then he asks if she's going to stay for the party. She says no, and since Nikolai is not allowed inside because he's just a driver, he asks her if she wants to go get a drink. She speeds off without answering him. That evening, Anna is back home and eats dinner with Helen and Stepan. Stepan gets a bit drunk, and asks how long she's going to stay with them. Helen gets after him, and tells Anna that she can stay as long as she likes. Anna just broke up with her boyfriend, which is why she's living with them. Stepan voices his disdain for her boyfriend, since he's black, and says that interracial couples shouldn't be together. He then says that's probably why Anna's baby died inside her, which greatly upsets her as well as angers Helen. Meanwhile, back at the restaurant, everyone is enjoying themselves and drinking when Kirill gets a phone call. He moves to a quieter place to talk, and asks if the coast is clear. The caller tells him that it is, and Kirill signals to Azim that everything's fine. Nikolai drives Kirill and Azim to the barber shop, and Azim wants Nikolai to wait outside. Kirill refuses, since Nikolai works for him and is helpful for the job. They walk inside and are startled by Ekrem, who's ecstatic that he got tickets to a big soccer game. Azim sends him on his way, and assures them that he wont speak about their presence. They go to a freezer, where Soyka's body is. Kirill eats some peanuts and jokes about the frozen corpse, also saying that the man was like a brother to him. Azim tells him to show some respect, but he pulls out an envelope full of cash and says that money is respect (he gives Azim the envelope). Since the body is so stiff, Nikolai asks for a hair dryer. He places the corpse on a table and uses the dryer to thaw the body. He pulls out his wallet and gives it to Azim. He then has Azim and Kirill leave, since it's going to get a bit nasty. Nikolai puts out his cigarette on his tongue, and then cuts off all the fingers and removes the teeth from the corpse. Nikolai and Kirill drive out to a waterfront, and they throw Soyka's wrapped up body into the river, where it sinks. Anna gets ready for work when Stepan and Helen walk into her room. Stepan tells her to be careful with the diary, since he's read the words rape, prostitute, and needle. Nikolai and Kirill go to a whorehouse to party. A lot of the girls look underage, but none of the customers care. Kirill is drunk, and licks a girl who's dancing on a pole. He then sits on Nikolai's lap, who's making out with a prostitute. He asks him which one hes going to sleep with, but Nikolai tells him that he'll pick when he's ready. He continues to make out with the prostitute but is interrupted again when Kirill smashes the stereo with a bottle. Kirill wants to make sure that Nikolai's not gay, and says that hes going to watch him have sex with one of the whores. Forced to pick, Nikolai chooses a prostitute named Kirilenko. He has sex with her while Kirill watches, and then when he's done Kirill claps. Nikolai tells him to go away while he changes. Kirilenko sings to herself, and Nikolai asks her what her full name is and where she's from. He gives her a wad of cash and tells her to live longer. Elsewhere, the police have found Soyka's body. The lead inspector goes into a tent to view the body. He sees that Soyka was part of the vory v zakone, a brotherhood of criminals. Each member is tattooed while in Russian prison, with each tattoo having significance. Upon seeing his tattoos, the inspector deduces that he was a captain of the vory v zakone, and that he knelt to no one. Another curious thing that catches his eye is a note inside of Soyka's jacket. Anna goes to Semyon's restaurant, and he's surprised by her coming early. She apologizes, and he welcomes her inside. She has photocopied Tatiana's diary, and gives the pages to Semyon to translate. He asks her where the original diary is, and she tells him that she wants to give it to Tatiana's baby when she's old enough. Semyon says that he broke his own rule; he drank vodka, and so since he's not sober he will translate the diary tomorrow. He asks her where she lives, but she says that she can come by again for the translation. As she leaves, Nikolai pulls up with a very drunk Kirill. Semyon closes the door on them, and Nikolai opens it using Kirill's key. Kirill is so drunk that he cant even stand up, and so he falls on the floor and rests his head on Nikolai's foot. Semyon, disappointed, walks over to Kirill and kicks him a couple of times. Nikolai tries to stand up for him, but Semyon puts him in his place. Nikolai goes outside and hears Anna in the alley, trying to start up her motorcycle. He tries to help her, but finds that the motorcycle is dead. He offers to drive her home, since its raining outside and Semyon would get after him if he let her walk home. While he drives, Anna asks him if he knew Tatiana. He says that he knows a lot of girls named Tatiana, but no pregnant ones. She then asks if Kirill knew her, and he tells her that he's just the driver. When they pull up to her home, she asks him what he wants in return. Nikolai says that he wants a Christmas present, and then leaves. While at work at the hospital, Anna watches over the baby, who she has named Christine, and gets emotional thinking about her own dead baby. Semyon surprises her, and when she asks how he got in he says that there are always open doors. She tries to get him to leave, but he says that he has translated the diary. He is most disturbed that Kirill is mentioned several times, including details about some illegal activities he has done. He asks that Anna not go to the police with the diary, claiming that Kirill is a good boy and that he will deal with him on his own. Before he leaves, he looks after Christine and remarks on how perfect she is. Anna goes home, and sees that Stepan is reading the diary out-loud while Helen writes it down in English. The passage details that Kirill threw Tatiana down the stairs and beat her. He tried to rape her, but when he found that he couldn't he wound up beating her some more. Semyon then proceeded to rape her and gave her a bunch of pills afterwards. Semyon is Christine's father. Anna tells them that Semyon translated the diary, and threatened the baby. In return for handing over the diary, Semyon promises to give Anna the address of Tatiana's family. Stepan gets after her for being so foolish, and since the baby is being threatened Helen and Anna agree to make the deal with Semyon. At the restaurant, Nikolai and Kirill receive a shipment of old alcohol in a truck. Nikolai asks where it came from, and Kirill says that if his father agrees, they'll let Nikolai deeper into their family and their business. Semyon appears and gets after Kirill for Soyka's death. Kirill denies having any involvement, but Nikolai tells Semyon the truth (that Kirill paid to have him murdered, and they got rid of the body). Semyon says that if anyone is to be killed, he doesn't want to be the last one to find out. He also mentions that Soyka's brothers might come looking for revenge, but Nikolai says that he will protect Kirill. Meanwhile, Anna, Helen, and Stepan go to a restaurant and drink some coffee. Nikolai walks in and sits down at their table. Stepan says that he used to be with the KGB, and knows how to deal with scum like Semyon. When things get cooled down, Nikolai asks for the diary (he's been sent by Semyon). Anna slides it across the table, and Nikolai puts it in his jacket. When she asks for Tatiana's address, Nikolai ignores her and walks outside. Anna runs out and demands to know the address. He tells her to forget any of this ever happened, to stay away from people like him, and to go back inside with the good people. Helen comes outside and brings Anna back inside the restaurant. Stepan spits in Nikolai's face, and Nikolai gestures that he's going to kill him via sticking his fingers underneath his throat and pointing at him. Nikolai goes back to Semyon's restaurant, and reads Tatiana's diary. Semyon is happy that he has retrieved it, but is concerned since Stepan has already read the diary, and orders Nikolai to kill him. It's also revealed that Soyka was killed because he was spreading rumors of Kirill being queer (homosexual). Semyon douses the diary with vodka and burns it while Nikolai looks on. The next day, Ekrim goes to the soccer game and his team loses. While walking down the street with a mob of fans, he stops in a graveyard and pisses on a grave. Two men approach him, one of whom is Soyka's brother, and slit his throat in broad daylight. A little later, Nikolai stalks Stepan to his home and follows him inside, where it's implied that he kills him. Nikolai then goes to the hospital and waits for Anna to get off of work. He reveals that he read the diary, and she asks him how he can still do what he's doing and be okay with it. He changes the subject and gives her the address of where Tatiana's family is. He says that its not a good place for a little girl to grow up in, and suggests that Anna just take care of Christine herself. In back of the restaurant, Semyon meets with Azim, who tells him that Soyka's brother has killed Ekrim. The brother has decided to spare Azim, but in return he must give up Kirill (who ordered the hit on Soyka). Semyon is not pleased with this, but tells Azim to inform the brother that he will do as he is told. That night, Anna waits outside the restaurant when Nikolai and Kirill pull up. Kirill orders her to go away, and orders Nikolai to stop seeing her. She tells them that Tatiana was just 14-years-old, but Kirill will hear none of it and goes inside. Nikolai tells Anna to go away and not get further involved with trying to learn more about Tatiana. Nikolia then enters the restaurant. As Nikolai and Kirill walk through the kitchen, Kirill mentions that the police raided the whorehouse, and asked for Kirilenko by name. They meet up with Semyon, who tells Kirill to go away while he talks with Nikolai on his own. Kirill, a bit hurt, storms off downstairs to get drunk. Nikolai tells Semyon that he killed Stepan, which pleases him. Afterwards, Nikolai goes downstairs and has a drink with Kirill. He says that Semyon offered him the opportunity to get his star tattoos, and he accepted. Kirill embraces him, and tries to come off as if it was his idea for Nikolai to get the stars (though its obvious he didn't know until he told him). Later on, several members of the vory v zakone arrive at the restaurant and are greeted by Semyon. Nikolai is seated in front of them wearing nothing but his underwear. The members inspect the tattoos he received while in prison, and review Nikolai's criminal and family history. Nikolai renounces his parents, and is then given the star tattoos on his shoulders and knees. The next day, Azim meets with Nikolai at a bathhouse to discuss some business. He says that it's a preferred meeting place, since everyone can see the tattoos they have. Azim and Nikolai dress down and wear towels. Azim excuses himself to use the restroom, and instead starts to get dressed again. Two thugs come in, and Azim tells them that Nikolai is Kirill (they don't know what he looks like). They spare Azim and walk into the sauna, where Nikolai is naked except for the towel on his head. A thug pulls out a knife and slashes his chest. Nikolai beats him up and wrestles for control over the blade. After that fails, he tries to crawl away but the other thug is waiting for him and slashes his body with another knife. Nikolai makes one of the thugs stab the other in the chest, and then brutally brawls with him on the floor. He gets his hand on a knife, places it underneath the goon's head, and smashes his head onto the blade. Nikolai, beaten and bloodied, starts to weakly crawl away. It turns out the other thug isn't dead yet, and he starts to choke Nikolai with his bare hands. The thug rips out the knife from his chest and tries to use it on Nikolai, but he gets the upper hand and stabs the thug through the eye. A little later at the hospital, Anna sees the extremely wounded Nikolai being carted down the hall. She enters his room and asks him if he knows where Stepan is. If he doesn't turn up soon, she'll get the authorities involved. Nikolai reveals that he was sent by Semyon to kill Stepan, but he didn't. Instead, he sent him to Edinburgh and set him up in a hotel. The police inspector who found Soyka's body arrives at the hospital and privately talks with Nikolai. It's revealed here that Nikolai is really an undercover MI5 agent hired to infiltrate the vory v zakone. The note he put in Soyka's jacket was a progress report, and he called in the raid on the whorehouse to help out Kirilenko. The inspector says that Scotland Yard and the KGB/FSB are not happy with Nikolai's job handling, and when he sees his star tattoos he is worried that he has perhaps gone too far undercover. Nikolai reassures him that everything's fine, and that he can even become head of the vory v zakone in London. The inspector balks at the idea, but Nikolai tells him that all they have to do is arrest Semyon. When he asks for what charges, Nikolai tells him that the charges will be the rape of the 14-year-old Tatiana. Since she's dead, she can't testify, but they can prove Semyon is the father of the baby through blood tests. Meanwhile, Kirill is inflating balloons for another party when he notices a little girl staring at him. She asks him if he fought with Semyon last night, because she could hear shouting and banging. Kirill says that its not a fight if one of them doesn't fight back, and says he was upset upon learning about Nikolai's attack (orchestrated by Semyon). Kirill then sees several policemen arriving outside the restaurant via security monitor, and tells the girl to go upstairs. After the cops leave, Kirill asks Semyon what the cops wanted with him. They took a blood sample from his arm, and Kirill asks him why they would want that. As Anna gets off of work, she sees Kirill in a closing elevator holding a gym bag. She rushes to the baby ward and finds flowers in place of Christine. Anna bumps into Nikolai again and harshly demands to know where Kirill took the baby. He honestly doesn't know, and so they both head out in search of Kirill, who goes back to the waterfront where Soyka's body was dumped. He picks up the gym bag, which has Christine inside, and sits by the water. He cries, and asks for forgiveness. He's about to throw Christine in the river when Nikolai and Anna arrive. Nikolai tells Kirill that Semyon has gone too far, and they don't kill babies. He then forces Kirill to choose between him and Semyon. Kirill embraces Nikolai and says that he didn't know that Semyon set him up at the bathhouse. Nikolai says that he understands, and gives Christine to Anna. Nikolai then tells Kirill that his time to control the family is now, and they can be partners with Semyon out of the way. Kirill becomes cheerful again, and tells Nikolai that they should go out to celebrate, since it's New Years Eve. Kirill walks off and waits for Nikolai. Anna demands to know who he is and why he helped them, but Nikolai simply replies that he couldn't be king if the king was still in place. They briefly kiss each other, and then Nikolai walks off with Kirill. Some time later, we see Helen and Stepan fixing lunch while Anna plays with Christine (she adopted her). Semyon is presumed to be in prison for Tatiana's rape. The final shot shows Nikolai sitting alone in the restaurant, leaving his future unclear.",

         "First of all it is amazing the amount of research that went into this movie. When Mortissen's characters says that his father worked for the government, in Russian he actually says: \"Hunched his back for the uncle\"! Even the poster with little and index finger straighter then the rest, it all breathers authenticity. I didn't go in expecting non-Russian actors to suddenly have no accent, but I did have hesitations about the pronunciation, that usually tends to be horrible. Not so here, despite the accent (that was slight), the intonation, the way the characters cary themselves especially Mortinssen's are very Russian. (Even his less then perfect English sounds Russia when he misses articles: \"Not good place for girl to grow up.\") Overall the director shows a bit of what a real SinCity looks like. Violence is like a snap of a whip, sudden and loud. The movie is very stylish, but without trying to be so. It's just how these people like to live their lifes. A lot has been said about acting and it is true Mortinssen really delivers. All the auther actors are great too though, there is no weak link in this movie. Anyway the bottom line: The most authentic movie about Russian mobsters that the west has produced so far. Furthermore I find the only aspect in which it looses to the Godfather is scope. Although the movie is complete I can not help, but to want for more. The best film I've seen this year.",
         "\"Eastern Promises\" will take your breath away, churn your stomach, and then leave you with memories of unforgettable characters as well as perplexing thoughts about good and evil. David Cronenberg's movie about Russian and Chechen mobsters clashing in London is more than violent - it is brutal, savage, shocking. But do not expect just an action film, exploiting blood and gore. After you shake off its terrific immediate impact (there is no way to think while watching it), you realize that \"Eastern Promises\" is also a kind of morality tale, complex and important. Only after you hold your breath, cover your eyes, and get through the movie do you realize how \"Eastern Promises\" manages to contradict Friedrich Nietzsche effectively. The German philosopher's \"Beyond Good and Evil\" denied the possibility of a universal morality. Cronenberg's film says that ethics - without expectation of rewards, in this life or a possible other one - can prevail even in the depths of great evil. The \"History of Violence\" director continues his subtle, subtext theme of upholding Anne Frank's belief that \"in spite of everything people are really good at heart,\" and he does so without a smidgen of sentimentality. There is no goodness in evidence as Viggo Mortensen's scary Russian mobster does every bidding of Armin Mueller-Stahl's chilling godfather figure, ruling ruthlessly over a family, which includes his son, a monster out of control, played brilliantly by Vincent Cassel (son of Jean-Pierre Cassel). During a pre-release press tour, Cronenberg spoke of his wish to present \"provocative, juicy stories... with complexity... showing that all monsters are sentimental and have some kind of relationship to a moral compass.\" That is all true, but what makes \"Eastern Promises\" so appealing is that there is no pop psychology (or worse, pop philosophy) in or about it. The film hits you over the head with its magnificently written story (Steven Knight, of \"Dirty Pretty Things\"), not with a message. The title, on one level, refers to promises made to young women in Russia, luring them to the West, where the Mob enslaves them as prostitutes. It is one of these drugged and brutalized women whose death opens the film, and brings an English nurse (Naomi Watts) into the story. As a multitude of promises, threats and tragedies unfolds, you get the maximum out of \"Eastern Promises\" with minimum advance knowledge of its story. Initially, that is. When you return to see it again, it won't matter that you'll know how it ends, you will want to re-experience what is certain to become a classic film. (\"Eastern Promises\" was shown at the Toronto Festival last week, opened in San Francisco today, goes nationwide on Sept. 21.)",
         "Eastern Promises is a further proof David Cronenberg is one of the last classic film-makers left. At the same time, he is a modernist. The combination, in the dark London he created, is a moral tale which makes you think of Dostoievsky. It's a story of crime and redemption with an unusual (hidden) tenderness. At the same time, it is a very serious trip into the rites of a secret society as we can see more and more in our big cities. A criminal secret society. Cronenberg (and his friend Peter Suschistky) have created another universe that seems another version of ours. As usual it is a mental one, but so close to what we call \"reality\" that it makes you uncomfortable and eventually horrified. The cast is fantastic and the script is brilliant.",
         "It is not often that audiences today are treated to a film that has as many things going for it as Eastern Promises does. Whether it's because of interference from studios determined to make their products as marketable as possible, filmmakers who favor style over substance, or just a plain old shortage of originality, nowadays it is a treat when a film fan can leave the theater and feel affected by the artistry that he/she has just experienced. On the surface, Eastern Promises is a straightforward crime story about people who don't appear to be terribly complex. But somehow, the combination of the narrative, the mood, and the humanness of the characters create an alchemy that transcends this film from something that could have been common into something quite unique and memorable. Noirish settings, dedicated medical professionals, and mobsters and their loyal henchmen are all commonplace enough in movies as to risk being clichés. Yet everything in this film about a London midwife who stumbles into contact with the Russian mob as she seeks clues to the identity of a teen who died in childbirth mesh together wonderfully and fully engage the viewer. While it all starts with the script, credit must be given to the director, David Cronenberg for bringing it to life, and for the cast, who created living, breathing characters who the viewer cares about- whether they are likable or not, good or evil, or not quite so easy to read. They seem real. At the core of the film is \"Nikolai,\" the loyal chauffeur to the kingpin's volatile son. \"Nikolai\" is both enigmatic and mesmerizing. We know he is a man with a past and with secrets, but we really don't know what his goals and motives are. We don't know who he is, yet somehow, just as the half-Russian midwife, \"Anna\", we are drawn to him and trust that there is goodness in him, even as were are not quite sure we should. It is a skillful, yet understated performance that quietly blows you away. Although Eastern Promises has some of the director's signature moments of eye-popping violence, they do not dominate this film and it is the quiet moments- where the characters are silently contemplating aspects of their own existence that give the film its power. We can see the introspection and pain on their faces, but the script leaves so much unsaid, and so much about the two main characters (played by Viggo Mortensen and Naomi Watts) we come to care about so much remain a beautiful, haunting mystery.",
         "I was bowled over by Viggo Mortensen's performance. I saw the film about a week ago and his eyes, his look, his smirk has been with me every day since. He is rapidly becoming my favorite actor because he makes something new, long lasting, thought provoking and totally true, out of the characters he plays, the way he plays them and I feel also, why he plays them. Here he is a Russian mobster's driver, or is he? The important thing is that you won't be able to take your eyes of him. Here he has David Cronemberg at his side / or sides, once again. Cronemberg seems to know and understand Mortensen's power. And Mortensen seems to trust him completely. Eastern Promises is a really good film with and extraordinary Viggo Mortensen at its very core. Not to be missed.",
         "In a wet and dreary pre-Christmas London, an anonymous, distressed, 14-year old Russian girl staggers into Trafalgar hospital, on the verge of giving birth, hemorrhaging badly and with obvious heroine tracks on her arms. Pediatric nurse Anna (Naomi Watts) tries in vain to save both mother and baby, but in the end, all that remains is the newborn, and a diary written in Russian in the girl's purse, that contains a business card for a Russian restaurant. Haunted by her own previous miscarriage, and determined that the baby girl not be sent to an orphanage, Anna attempts to have the diary translated in order to identify the anonymous girl's family. In so doing, she becomes embroiled in the dark, seething world of crime, drugs, and prostitution of the Russian Mob. It is an enclosed, hot house society, where family loyalty and responsibility and adherence to the \"vory v zakone\" code of thieves are paramount, and shady characters like the \"restauranteur\" Semyon (Armin Mueller-Stahl), his son Kirill (Vincent Cassel) and his \"driver\" Nikolai (Viggo Mortensen) exist on the periphery of the law. As a long-time fan of Cronenberg's work, it is interesting for me to see his recent films grab the public attention in such a mainstream way. While it is true that both \"A History of Violence\" and \"Eastern Promises\" feature less obviously fantastic elements than, say, \"The Fly\" or \"Scanners\", Cronenberg's uniquely clinical and undramatic visual and storytelling style remain intact throughout all of his films. Nothing in a David Cronenberg film appears on- screen without a reason. He's sort of the film-making equivalent of Ernest Hemingway: a deceptively simple, unflinching eye; a calm surface that somehow manages to get under your skin and hints at labyrinthine depths beneath. Cronenberg's work always makes you uncomfortable, but here in \"Eastern Promises\", it is done very subtly, almost subliminally, so you find yourself thinking about it afterward without realizing it. The acting in Eastern Promises is uniformly excellent. Viggo Mortensen's Nikolai, in particular, displays a still, coiled menace that is chilling and intense, which plays well against Vincent Cassel's portrayal of the feral Kirill, whose confused and tortured attempts to live up to his father's criminal expectations set the plot in motion, and Armin Mueller-Stahl's stunningly nuanced performance as the crime boss Semyon: Satan dressed up as your favorite uncle at Christmastime. As Anna, unwittingly tossed into this den of serpents, Naomi Watts manages to be simultaneously vulnerable and tenacious in a role for which she will doubtless receive too little credit. Cronenberg's no-nonsense approach to violence is still in evidence here, from the shockingly bloody opening scene, to one remarkably brutal fight sequence that deserves to be written down in the annals of film history, and is so astonishing that it isn't until afterward that you register the fact that Viggo Mortensen did the whole thing completely nude. But, in the end, it is the sinuous undercurrent of hope, the trickle of humanity that manages to somehow exist amongst these desperate characters, that sticks with me in this film. The writing hints at things rather than stating them, the muted \"film noir\" visual style enhances this, and even the \"big plot twist\" near the end of the story (that I wouldn't dream of spoiling for you) is handled with the most minimalist of gestures. I swear, sometime soon David Cronenberg is going to discover the meaning of life in a black screen.",
         "I know a gent that did police detective work in St Petersburg, Russia for a couple of years, mostly blackmarket stuff. One night over dinner he told me, \"In St Petersburg everything is available. And you don't want to know what everything is\". Eastern Promises has more than a little bit of 'everything'. Some real edge of your seat moments in this instant classic. Set in dark wet, and noir London, Eastern Promises takes a look into a Russian Gangster mentality and culture with some scenes that will make both your skin crawl and your heart ache. This is one tough and nasty thriller. Not for the squeamish. A twisted morality tale of family dynamics, gang loyalty and one possible way the Good Guys just might usurp the Bad. Every principal character etches a note that resonates true to the scale of the story. And its an excellent dark dark black hearted story full of places and people that you just hope this movie is as close as you ever get to them. Genuinely bad characters with such exquisite details that it doesn't feel like fiction. Go see it. Pleasant nightmares!",
         "Russian mobsters, a rainy, murky London, a midwife and Viggo Mortensen makes this David Cronemberg film a perfect companion piece to his \"A History Of Violence\". My two favourite films of this idiosyncratic and fascinating director. Naomi Watts and motherhood go beautifully together and it's her gutsy maternal instinct that throws her in a world populated by truly horrible people. The trick is, we go with her and within that brutal world we meet some memorable characters. Viggo Mortensen, what an actor! His fearlessness is riveting, he's also beautiful beyond words. We think we can read him but we doubt our own thoughts, he's in total control of his character and of his audience. He has the face of an icon and he underplays it, over playing it. If you see History Of Violence and Eastern Promises you'll understand what I mean. This is not a film to like but to love and I loved it.",
         "A terrific, tight, violent, homo erotic thriller with a soul and a heart and if that wasn't enough, Viggo Mortensen! He is an astonishing actor, he's always been. But now his Russian \"I'm just a driver\" goes further than most actors would have dared. He is magnetic. Cronenberg designs two lives again for him but this time the universe where he lives is made of monsters with an accent. The splendid Armin Mueller-Stahl's bonhomie doesn't fools us for a moment. \"A diary?\" That's enough for us to know and to fear. Vincent Cassel is also terrific and his down, tactile moments with Viggo Mortensen, have an erotic undercurrent that is impossible to ignore. Naomi Watts brings the heart to the proceedings without ever being sentimental. David Cronenberg, I feel, is entering a spectacular new face to his already remarkable career.",
         "When I first saw the trailer for Eastern Promises, I was a little confused. Yes, A History of Violence was a complete turnaround style picture for David Cronenberg (whose previous films include the most twistedly eccentric visions of horrendously graphic violence and overtly over sexualized human beings and monsters), but I had not expected that he would continue down the path of the \"independent mainstream\". I was a little hesitant to see it at first, but gradually the trailer's imagery drew me in. And now I can say there really is a reason for the Oscar buzz. There really is no way to perfectly describe Eastern Promises without giving a few juicy details away. It revolves around a Russian crime circuit in London, headed by Semyon (Armin Mueller-Stahl), and includes his son Kirill (Vincent Cassel) and Kirill's driver Nikolai (Viggo Mortensen). Anna (Naomi Watts), a midwife, gets involved within the circuit unknowingly when she attempts to get a diary, recently left by a teenage mother who died during childbirth, translated from Russian into English. The plot is really not that complicated, but giving a full description ruins the little idiosyncrasies and poignant character moments shared within the film. Oscar-nominee Steve Knight has constructed a gritty, atmospheric thriller that starts up quick and then slows down to a nice steady pace, just so the audience can catch its breath and brood over the workings of the cast. It is dialogue driven, but when it is not being sly or darkly comedic, it plays out like an opera. We gradually learn all the intimate details of every sketchy character, and we get a deeper sense of just how bad some of these characters are. It is not just a paint-by-numbers depiction of bad men, it is a highly detailed and clearly articulate character study. And even at its dullest moments, it works excellently. Kudos also goes to Cronenberg's go to cinematographer, Peter Suschitsky. London and its drab and depressing climate are beautifully represented here from the first frame, all the way up to the last. Even when the sun is out, the sets have a certain subdued haze over them. We are watching a film about the criminal underbelly, and its settings help reflected just how low these people are in their moral standings. It works greatly in favour of the film, and it almost works as a character in itself. The drab, almost noir, settings help achieve the dirty politics of the film, and they help explore the character studies even further. Whether it's the scariness of watching Mortensen in the dark, or just looking at the glare of Mueller-Stahl in his dimmed restaurant, all of the details have been amped up on each set to give the audience a greater sense of understanding and purpose, for just about every character. And what Cronenberg film would be without some bizarrely violent visuals? While not exactly a bloodbath, Cronenberg does have a few moments where he paints the screen a bright shade of scarlet red. And when it begins to flow, there is nothing that can really stop it. It works much in the same way as it did in Violence, in that the film builds to a scene loaded with it and just lets loose in a ferocious manner unlike any well-known director currently working in the mainstream on movies that are not specifically horror (with obvious exceptions to Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez). It has that Cronenbergian touch, and much like his other films, its style is impeccable and thought-provoking. Another fantastic element is the score by Howard Shore. It slows when it needs to, and it quickens even faster. It plays out wonderfully throughout the scenes, and gives them a sort of classy feel. I realize I used the opera description before, but it fits even better here. Its great workings underpin every scene, and help dictate just how well off the film is. What hurts the film (besides some very bizarre choices by Watts' character) is the denouement. It works, but I just cannot fathom how neither Knight nor Cronenberg thought it was appropriate for the story that was taking place. It just does not have the solid impact that every other scene either has, or builds to. I sat, almost dumbfounded, trying to figure out who thought it was a good idea, and why no one told them to re-write it. But I will say, much like Violence, Promises has an absolutely stunning final moment. But to get to that astounding moment, you have to sit through a rather disappointing finale. If you thought you had seen Mortensen's best work before Promises, then you will be in for a very big surprise. His cold and calculating performance as Nikolai is the stuff that creates legends. He is menacing from the word go, and even as the enigmatic slowly becomes the well-known, you will just stare in fear and awe as he speaks on screen. From the terrifying tattoos, to a small character moment where he puts out a cigarette on his tongue, Mortensen is the quintessential image of evil. His unrestrained anger is felt throughout the film, and hopefully, will be just the right performance to launch him into the stratosphere of Oscar-nominated actors. Even during the let-down of an ending, he keeps up, and never lets anyone down. The rest of the cast, albeit nowhere near as strong as Mortensen, are all very good supporting characters. Watts' character may have issues, but she breathes a certain life into the naïve character that I doubt many others could match. Much the same goes for Cassel and Mueller-Stahl, who bring just the right amount of intensity to their roles. Although it is flawed, Cronenberg has delivered yet another exceptional thriller. It will surely be recognized at Oscar time, and for good reason too. Do not miss it. 8.5/10."

         "In London, the Russian pregnant teenager Tatiana arrives bleeding in a hospital, and the doctors save her baby only. The Russian descendant midwife Anna Khitrova finds Tatiana's diary written in Russian language in her belongings and decided to find her family to deliver the baby, she brings the diary home and ask her uncle Stepan to translate the document. Stepan refuses, but Anna finds a card of a restaurant owned by the Russian Semyon inside the diary and she visits the old man trying to find a lead to contact Tatiana's family. When she mentions the existence of the diary, Semyon immediately offers to translate the document. However, Stepan translates part of the diary and Anna discovers that Semyon and his sick son Kirill had raped Tatiana when she was fourteen years old and forced her to work as prostitute in a brothel of their own. Further, Semyon is the dangerous boss of the Russian mafia \"Vory v Zakone\", jeopardizing the safety of Anna and her family. Meanwhile, Semyon's driver Nikolai Luzhin gets close to Kirill and Semyon, climbing positions in the criminal organization, but he helps Anna, her family and the baby.",
         "The mysterious and charismatic Russian-born Nikolai Luzhin is a driver for one of London's most notorious organized crime families of Eastern European origin. The family itself is part of the Vory V Zakone criminal brotherhood. Headed by Semyon, whose courtly charm as the welcoming proprietor of the plush Trans-Siberian restaurant impeccably masks a cold and brutal core, the family's fortunes are tested by Semyon's volatile son and enforcer, Kirill, who is more tightly bound to Nikolai than to his own father. But Nikolai's carefully maintained existence is jarred once he crosses paths at Christmastime with Anna Khitrova, a midwife at a North London hospital. Anna is deeply affected by the desperate situation of a young teenager who dies while giving birth to a baby. Anna resolves to try to trace the baby's lineage and relatives. The girl's personal diary also survives her; it is written in Russian, and Anna seeks answers in it. Anna's mother Helen does not discourage her, but Anna's irascible Russian-born uncle Stepan urges caution. He is right to do so; by delving into the diary, Anna has accidentally unleashed the full fury of the Vory. With Semyon and Kirill closing ranks and Anna pressing her inquiries, Nikolai unexpectedly finds his loyalties divided. The family tightens its grip on him; who can, or should, he trust? Several lives - including his own - hang in the balance as a harrowing chain of murder, deceit, and retribution reverberates through the darkest corners of both the family and London itself.",
