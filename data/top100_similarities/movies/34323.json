      "synopsis": "The film opens in May 1978 with newspaper clippings about missing people and a summary of how they were found. Police officials raided the Firefly house and found body parts in the refrigerator, as well as furniture made out of human limbs. They also found enough evidence and corpses in the basement to put the Firefly body count at 75 people, maybe more. The family would forever be known by the media as \"The Devil's Rejects\"..... On an early morning, Tiny (Matthew McGrory) is seen dragging a naked mutilated female body through the woods. He is on his way to the Firefly house when he spots numerous police vehicles making their way down to the house as well. Tiny lifts up his burlap sack covering his burnt face and looks at the swarm of police as they approach the house. Tiny remains unseen in the forest. The police arrive and park in front of the Firefly house. The police are led by Sheriff John Quincy Wydell (William Forsythe), brother of Lieutenant George Wydell (Tom Towles) who was killed by the Firefly family (in the first movie, \"House of 1000 Corpses\"). The police strap on bullet proof vests and ready their guns. Officer Ray Dobson (Dave Sheridan) asks Sheriff Wydell if he thinks they will die today. Wydell tells him: \"dying ain't an option\". He pumps his shotgun and gets ready to talk through a speaker box. Inside the house, Otis (Bill Moseley) is sleeping next to a naked female corpse, Baby (Sheri Moon) is fast asleep in her room, and Mother Firefly (Leslie Easterbrook) sleeps in her bedroom. They are all awakened when Wydell orders them to come out peacefully because the police have the house surrounded. Otis looks through a window and sees all the cops. He puts on shirt and jeans, picks up his pistol, then walks downstairs. Baby gets dressed and grabs her gun, and heads downstairs with Mother Firefly. Rufus Jr. (Tyler Mane) is already at the bottom of the stairs in full metal body armor and tells them that they are completely surrounded. The Firefly brood ask about Tiny and Mother Firefly says he left last night and hasn't come back. Otis and Rufus position themselves at the front of the house while Mother Firefly and Baby position themselves in the back by the kitchen. Mother Firefly is crying, and says she remembers how Baby looked like an angel when she was born. Baby and Mother Firefly say \"I love you\" as they put on their metal masks. Otis dons his metal mask, which has a skull painted on it, and readies to fire on the police. Wydell and the cops open fire on the Firefly household. The family members inside take cover and then return fire. Otis and Rufus fire machine guns while Baby and Mother Firefly fire pistols. They kill a couple of cops, but are fired upon heavily again by the law enforcement outside. During this shootout, Otis shoots Wydell in the chest, but his bullet proof vest keeps him alive. This enrages Wydell even further and he walks slowly towards the house pumping shells from his shotgun. Eventually, he orders the officers to cease fire and throw in tear gas. Wydell kicks in the door to the gas-filled house and is followed by the other officers (all of whom are wearing gas masks). Suddenly, Otis and the family come out of their hiding places and again open fire. The cops around Wydell get hit but he doesn't. Otis, Baby, and Mother Firefly make their way to the kitchen entrance while the police unload their guns into Rufus' body armor. Rufus eventually dies from all the bullet hits. Mother Firefly sees that her son is dead and goes to his side while Baby and Otis go through a secret tunnel in the house. Wydell orders Mother Firefly to drop her gun, but she points it to her own head and says \"you'll never get me\". She pulls the trigger, but the gun is out of bullets. Wydell tells her \"it looks like it's not going to be that easy\". As the opening credits roll we see Otis and Baby running through the secret tunnel while their kidnap victims scream at them. The tunnel leads to a sewer, and Otis and Baby escape through it. They run through a nearby field with their weapons in hand as the police enter the house and discover all of their victims. Mother Firefly is taken in handcuffs to the police station. A nurse (Mary Woronov) drives by and sees Baby lying in the road. and gets out of her car to make sure Baby's alright. Baby jumps the woman and holds her down and Otis pops out and stabs the nurse to death. They steal her car and drive off. The police, upon further search of the house, come across several notebooks and pictures of all the people the Fireflys have killed. They notice that Captain Spaulding (Sid Haig) is in a lot of the pictures with various dead people, smiling while showing off his bloody hands. Wydell recognizes Spaulding and orders his men to find him. Meanwhile, we see Spaulding having wild, rough sex with a prostitute (Ginger Lynn Allen). After they are done, Spaulding calls her a whore. She draws a gun on him and says she is not a whore to which Spaulding replies \"I call them as I see them\". She cocks the gun to blow his brains out and Spaulding says he's just joking around with her. She laughs and blows his brains out. Spaulding wakes up (it was all a dream) and we see he is sleeping with an unattractive husky woman. She asks him if he had a bad dream. Spaulding looks at the woman he just had sex with and says \"it was 50/50\". They get out of bed and watch Spaulding's new TV commercial advertising his new monkey attraction. Spaulding's pissed when his commercial is interrupted by a news bulletin. He's even more pissed, and worried, when the news clip shows the raid on the Fireflys who the media have dubbed \"The Devil's Rejects.\" When Baby calls Spaulding we realize he's her father. Baby explains what happened and they agree to meet at the motel they're supposed to meet at in case of an emergency. We see Baby get in the car with Otis and drive away while Spaulding leaves his house and drives to the motel. Back at the police station, Wydell and several officers interrogate Mother Firefly about the whereabouts of the other family members. She refuses to rat out her own family and says that the cops just want to have sex with her (she used to be a prostitute). Wydell shows her notebooks and pictures of her victims, but she is unmoved. Mother Firefly then gets some pictures from a notebook and says that she never knew exactly where to put them. She shows the photos to Wydell and they turn out to be his dead brother. She pieces together that this Wydell is related to the one she'd killed and insults them both. Wydell loses it and back-hands her face. He grabs her throat and says \"I'm going to kill your whole fucking family!\". Officer Dodson and the other officers pull Wydell from her and they all leave. As they do, Mother Firefly loses it as well and spouts insults, while saying that her family will kill Wydell. Meanwhile, we cut to a ranch which is called Charlie's Frontier Fun Town, a brothel, which is run by Charlie Altamont (Ken Foree). His assistant Clevon (Michael Berryman) cleans the place mostly. Charlie's counting money and he's surprised by how little cash he's got. Candy (Elizabeth Daily) says the only customer she got was a farmer who only wanted a hand job. Charlie says they've got to think of new ways to attract more customers. Candy says that she has an idea: they could do a Star Wars theme and she'd dress up like Princess Leia. She figures lots of geeks will want to have sex with Princess Leia, and Clevon says he definitely would. Charlie says he will keep on brainstorming. The phone rings, and it's Spaulding calling from a payphone. We find out Charlie and Spauldding, who gives him a rundown of the situation, are adopted brothers. Charlie doesn't want the Fireflys coming to his place but Spaulding's response is to hang up the phone. Otis and Baby arrive at the agreed upon motel but Spaulding's not there yet. Otis calls him a \"dumb old bitch\" then Baby and Otis exchange insults with one another. He orders her to get a room to chill out in until Spaulding arrives. Baby looks around and comes across a traveling band called \"Banjo & Sullivan\". Adam Banjo (Lew Temple), his wife Wendy Banjo (Kate Norby), Roy Sullivan (Geoffrey Lewis), and their roadie Jimmy (Brian Posehn) are all making fun of Roy's wife Gloria (Priscilla Barnes) because her breasts popped out while she was riding a mechanical bull the night before. The Banjo's and Gloria get settled in Room 2, while Roy and Jimmy go out to get ice. On the way to the ice machine, Jimmy says that he thinks he could be a good clown and do a bull act. Roy thinks that Jimmy can do something better and sends him to a nearby gas station to get beef jerky. Roy is alone filling up an ice bucket when Baby runs into him. She pretends she's looking for her cat. Baby flirts with Roy who obviously likes it. Baby asks to go to his room so they \"can have some fun\". Roy says that he can't, as his wife is in his room. Baby then tells him to take her to his room or else her half-brother (Otis) will kill him. Otis appears with his gun in hand and they all proceed to walk to Room 2. Wendy is showering while Gloria watches a talk show about satanic stuff. She tells Adam to change the channel. Adam does and hears some knocking at the door. Adam opens the door and Otis shoves him onto the bed. As Roy enters the room he too is shoved onto the bed. Otis hears the shower and bursts into the bathroom. He drags the nude Wendy out of the bathroom and pushes her too onto the bed. Adam covers her up with a blanket and a flannel shirt. After exchanging insults with Baby, Otis asks if there is anyone else with them. Roy says \"no\" just as Jimmy comes back from the gas station and knocks on the door. Otis orders everyone stay cool and be quiet. Baby answers the door and lets Jimmy in. She shoves him onto the floor and Otis shoots him in the forehead, killing him. Everyone screams, and Adam vomits over Wendy and the bed. Otis gets really pissed off at Roy, saying he can't trust him. Meanwhile, Spaulding's red truck runs out of gas so he pulls it off onto the shoulder and wonders what to do next. He sees a woman (P.J. Soles) and her young boy coming out of a convenience store nearby. He approaches them and tells them that he needs to take their car \"on account of top secret clown business\". He laughs with the woman, and she then asks what he wants. Spaulding asks back \"did I stutter, bitch?\". The woman orders her son to get into the car and to lock the door (he does). She walks around to the driver's side and tries to open the door, but Spaulding punches her in the face and gets in. The boy is clearly scared, and Spaulding asks him why he doesn't like clowns. The boy doesn't answer. Spaulding tells him that he's going to come back, and if the boy doesn't have a good answer to why he doesn't like clowns, he's going to kill his entire family. He orders the crying boy out of the car. Spaulding drives off to meet his kids (Otis and Baby). Back at the motel, Baby dances in front of Roy. Otis asks him if he likes what he sees, but Roy says no. Otis asks him if he is queer or something. Roy says he is a married man. Otis orders Gloria to get up and to take off all her clothes so he can see what Roy is attracted to. Gloria takes off her pants and is in her bra and underwear. Otis gets up and runs his gun up and down her body. He eventually gets to the point where he puts his gun down the front side of Gloria's underwear and forces her to fellate him. After he's through, he calls her disgusting and shoves her back onto the bed. He then orders Adam and Roy to take a road trip with him. They leave in the \"Banjo & Sullivan\" van while Baby stays in the room to keep an eye on Gloria and Wendy. Otis has Adam drive to the desert. Once they reach their destination (which looks like a junkyard), Otis orders Roy and Adam out of the van. They have to walk the rest of the way. Adam wants to know exactly where he is taking them. Otis honestly tells them that they are going to dig up a crate of weapons that he buried some time ago and then implies that he is going to kill them afterwards. Roy and Adam stop walking to plead with Otis to spare their lives. Otis taunts Adam by asking if Wendy gets off when he vomits on her. Adam lunges at Otis, but he shoves him aside and aims his gun at Roy's head. Adam then grabs a piece of wood and hits Otis in the head with it. Adam hits Otis with the wood a couple of more times, but Otis won't go down that easy. However, Otis loses his gun and Roy tries to retrieve it. Otis jumps on top of Roy and struggles with him. Adam jumps on top of Otis and hits him a couple of times. Otis then takes out his very sharp hunting knife and rams it into Adam's leg. Otis continues to struggle with Roy over the gun. Adam rips the knife out of his leg and tries to stab Otis. Otis forces Roy to pull the trigger on the gun, and he makes Roy shoot Adam in the neck. Adam goes down. Otis snatches the gun away and proceeds to pistol whip Roy. After he's done, he picks up the piece of wood that Adam used on him and hits Roy in the crotch with it. Otis walks over to the bleeding Adam, who begs Otis to stop. But the angry and bruised Otis says \"I haven't even begun!\" He shows him what happens to men who try to be heroes: Otis grabs the piece of wood and smashes Roy's skull, killing him. He then walks over to Adam and tells him that he has something else planned for him. Otis begins to slash up Adam's face with his knife. Back at the motel, Baby watches a singer on TV. Gloria hums along with the music but Baby tells her to shut up. Wendy has to go to the bathroom. Baby says that she could care less about where Wendy pees. If Wendy is to go to the bathroom, Baby wants something in return: she wants Wendy to hit Gloria. Wendy is hesitant, but Gloria assures her it is okay. Wendy lightly slaps Gloria, but Baby is not happy. Wendy slaps Gloria harder, but Baby is still not happy. Wendy slaps Gloria the hardest she can. Baby orders Wendy to kiss her and say \"Baby, I'm having a great time\". Wendy kisses Baby on the cheek and repeats the line. Wendy goes to the bathroom and Baby tells her to make it quick. Once in the bathroom, Wendy frantically looks for a way out. She smashes the window with the toilet lid and screams for help. Baby gets up and gets up to kill Wendy when Gloria grabs Baby's gun and points it at her. Baby asks her why she would do that, and we see Baby hiding a big knife behind her back. Gloria says that she will pull the trigger. She then yells to Wendy that everything is fine, and she can come out of the bathroom. Baby then throws her knife into Gloria's chest. Gloria drops to her knees and pulls out the long knife from her chest. Baby pulls down her pants and playfully tells her to \"shoot her bottom off\". Gloria, near death, raises the gun at Baby's butt and pulls the trigger. Nothing happens. Baby laughs and says the gun isn't loaded. Wendy comes out of the bathroom to find Gloria dying. She pushes Baby out of her way and runs outside. Gloria dies. Wendy bangs on all the doors of the motels creaming for help but nobody will answer. As she runs to the pool area she sees a man she thinks will help.The man turns out to be Spaulding. Baby catches up to Wendy and tells her father that she almost got away. As Wendy realizes who her \"savior\" is, he head-butts her unconscious.They drag her back to the motel room gagging her and tying her to the bed post. Spaulding asks where Otis is and Baby tells him Otis went to their secret stash to get the guns. Spaulding says Otis better not mess it up as Otis bursts into the room scaring the two. Otis has cut Adam's face off and is wearing it as a mask. Otis and Spaulding insult each other but Baby tells them to quit. They discuss what to do with Wendy. Spaulding suggests leaving her behind for the maid in the morning, but Otis says he has something better in mind. The scene ends with Otis kissing Wendy with Adam's face. The next morning, a motel maid finds nobody in Room 2 so she enters to find the place a mess. She opens the bathroom door to find the butchered remains of Jimmy and Gloria in the bathtub. The words, \"The Devil's Rejects\" and \"fuck you\" are written all over the wall with blood. As she screams she wakes Wendy who is tied to the front door. We see Otis has strapped Adam's face onto hers. Wendy breaks free and falls on top of the maid. The maid freaks out and runs away. Wendy wildly chases the maid in hope that she will help her. When she can't catch up to her, Wendy runs into the middle of the road and tries to wave down a car but wearing her husband's face, no one will slow down for her. A big truck runs over Wendy and she is killed. Sheriff Wydell and the police are called to the scene. Wendy's body parts and brains are splattered all over the road. The police realize, as the local sheriff (Steve Railsback) confirmed, that the scene is a gory mess. Wydell orders a deputy to clean her brains off of the pavement and then goes to the maid and shows her pictures of Spaulding, Otis, and Baby. He asks her if she has seen any of them, but she says 'no'. Wydell is called away because he has some visitors: a pair of bounty hunters who call themselves \"the Unholy Two\". These two men are Rondo (Danny Trejo) and Billy Ray Snapper (Diamond Dallas Page). Wydell gives them the mugshots of the three fugitives and orders them to find Spaulding, Otis, and Baby. Back at the police station, as the police search the police records they come to the realization that the Firefly family names are taken from characters in the movies of Groucho Marx and the Marx brothers. Wydell and the police research the names of characters in Groucho movies.They call in a \"film expert\" to help them, but he turns out to be useless. Wydell then gets a call from the Unholy Two who tell him that they discovered Charlie Altamont uses a Groucho character name as an alias. Wydell figures out that the Firefly's are headed to Charlie's place. As Otis drives Spaulding and Baby in the stolen van, Spaulding tells him to drive to Charlie's brothel. Otis doesn't trust Charlie, but Spaulding orders him to drive there anyway. Baby sees a sign for ice cream and wants Otis to stop. Otis explains he won't stop, because those 20 seconds they spend getting ice cream could wind up being dangerous to his health. Spaulding and Baby proceed to annoy Otis by chanting they want \"rutti fucking tutti\". Otis tells them \"there is no ice cream in your future\". The next scene we see Spaulding and Baby eating ice cream, and Otis irritated that he actually caved in. Baby offers Otis some of her ice cream, but he refuses. As they listen to music Baby gets ice cream on Otis' beard and they all laugh about it. Meanwhile, Wydell is at the Firefly house. As he goes through the basement he hears what he thinks is Spaulding's voice and sees the top of his head. But when Wydell sees who it really is he freaks out; it is his dead brother George. Wydell asks George what he's doing down there, and George tells him that it is his home now. He doesn't have a choice in the matter, and he is stuck there until the Fireflys die. George urges Wydell to step \"over the line\" and kill all of them for him. Wydell suddenly wakes up and we realize it was a dream. Later that night, he goes to visit Mother Firefly in the jail house. He tells the guards to go home leaving him alone with Mother. She taunts Wydell telling him he just can't resist having sex with her. Wydell's response is to stab Mother Firefly twice in the chest. She is dead. Pulling the knife from her chest he leaves it on the table and walks away. That evening, Otis, Baby, and Spaulding arrive at Charlie's Frontier Fun Town. Charlie walks outside with a shotgun and orders them to put their hands in the air. As they comply Otis becomes pissed off that they came all the way out there just to get held at gun-point. Charlie shoots Spaulding in the face at which time we realize Charlie's holding a squirt gun. They hug each other and catch up on old times. Charlie, Otis, Spaulding, and Baby proceed to party and get drunk with Charlie's prostitutes (with the occasional weed). While at the same time Wydell has gone completely berserk and is talking to himself in the mirror. He vows to kill all of them for his brother. The next morning, Charlie and Clevon leave to get chickens for dinner. Charlie tells Clevon that Spaulding makes the best fried chicken. They drive until they find a guy who is selling chickens. The guy asks them if they have sex with chickens. Charlie and Clevon are both offended by this and the guy tells them he's only asking because it looks like they, especially Clevon, have a lot of sexual tension locked up inside. Charlie and Clevon especially are weirded out when the guy says when you cut off the head of a chicken and stick your penis inside, it feels like a vagina. Charlie buys a couple of chickens (for eating) and he and Clevon leave.However, they don't get very far because Wydell's blocking the road with his truck. Charlie gets out of his car and when he walks up to Wydell's truck Wydell uses the truck door to hurt Charlie's fingers. Wydell then orders him to keep Spaulding and the two others pre-occupied at his place until midnight. If he refuses, Charlie will be killed. Wydell leaves, and Charlie is left with quite a dilemma. Wydell meets up with Billy Ray Snapper and Rondo at Snapper's trailer home. He tells them the Fireflys will be at Charlie's place at midnight. He warns Snapper and Rondo not to mess up tonight and explains he doesn't care what condition the Fireflys are in but wants them alive enough to feel the same pain their victims felt. The Unholy Two tell Wydell he's very sick and twisted and Wydell's only response is again to tell them not to mess up.. That night, Charlie and Spaulding snort cocaine and we see Charlie take the coke as he leaves to go to the bathroom while Spaulding puffs away on a joint. Otis is fooling around with Candy, and Baby is taking a sponge bath and talking to a prostitute named Cassey (Deborah Van Valkenburgh). Cassey goes to the fridge to get herself and Baby some cold beers. Rondo sneaks up behind her then covers her mouth and violently slits her throat. Billy Ray Snapper scratches the record and Otis realizes that they have been caught. Rondo orders Baby at gunpoint to get up and Baby (completely naked) goes to get clothes. Candy grabs Otis' gun and tries to shoot Billy, but he shoots her dead with a bullet to the forehead. Otis lunges at Billy who promptly chucks Otis out the window. Wydell arrives where Spaulding is hiding and throws back a shot of liquor before suprising the clown. Spaulding insults him and his brother, so Wydell shoots Spaulding in the belly. The Fireflys then discover Charlie betrayed them. Wydell herds Spaulding, Otis, and Baby into the back of his police truck and tells Rondo and Billy that their services are no longer needed. The Unholy Two then drive away as Wydell drives in the opposite direction toward the Firefly house. The three killers sit tied to chairs in the basement listening to Wydell talk about how his family has always been demon slayers. Wydell kicks Otis in the crotch and orders him to stay awake. He picks up a picture of a missing girl and shows Otis a picture of the girl's corpse when she was found in the house. Otis says that the girl's still sex worthy. Wydell staples the pictures to Otis' chest. Wydell walks over to Baby and staples her with pictures of a girl she killed. Spaulding insults Wydell who proceeds to beat Spaulding almost to death with a metal pipe. Wydell punches Otis and Baby as he continues to torture them. Wydell continues to get shitfaced drunk and nails Otis' hands to the chair's armrests. Wydell unties Baby and tells her to run. He then splashes gasoline all over the floor and lights it on fire, leaving Otis and Spaulding to burn to death. Baby runs outside through the place where the family kept cows. Wydell grabs an axe and says Baby is like a rabbit, and she should run like a rabbit. He chases Baby around the farm. She hides in a barn and runs into Charlie. Baby's pissed at him for giving them up but Charlie proceeds to explain he came to get them out of there. She says Otis and Spaulding are tied up in the house which is currently in flames. Charlie puts Baby in his car saying he'll get the others. As he leaves for the house Wydell shows up and plunges an axe into Charlie's throat. He rips out the axe and hits him again to kill him. Wydell chases Baby out of the car. As Baby tries to flee she is thrown to the ground when Wydell fires his gun and hits her in her lower left leg. Wydell, now completely deranged, begins to choke her to death with his bare hands. A figure suddenly appears behind Wydell and lifts him off the ground. It's Tiny, who then wraps his arms around Wydell and with super strength kills Wydell by breaking his neck. Baby tells Tiny to save the others from the burning house. Tiny goes inside to the basement where he rips the nails out of Otis' hands freeing both him and Spaulding. They all escape the house. In the front seat of Charlie's car, Otis gets behind the wheel while his step father Spaulding (whom he addresses as 'Cutter') and half-sister Baby climb into the back seat. Otis asks Tiny, \"are you sure you want to do this?\" Tiny nods. Otis says they will come back for him. Otis and the remaining Fireflys drive away and we see Tiny slowly walking into the burning house which proceeds to blow up with Tiny inside. As dawn breaks, Otis is driving through the desert mountains with Baby and Spaulding asleep in the back seat, all of them thinking about the good times they have had together. Otis suddenly stops the car. A look of disappointment, fear, and sorrow comes across his face. We see just further ahead on that road is a HUGE police blockade. The officer in charge of the barricade is Ray Dobson, the young officer seen with Wydell in the opening raid and at Wydell's side through most of the movie. Otis tearfully wakes up Spaulding and Baby in the back seat. They see they are not going to make it. Baby stands up in the back seat after Otis gives her a gun, Spaulding takes the shotgun, and leans out the right-side of the car. With a gun in his left hand Otis drives with his right as they speed firing toward the police. Although they hit a few police they are seriously outnumbered. Wounded by police fire Otis continues driving and he, Baby and Spaulding continue shooting at the police, all three of them taking multiple hits. In their final act of demented glory, the Fireflys ram their car into the roadblock and their mad lives are ended in a hailstorm of police bullets.",

         "Alright, I never bothered with \"House of 1,000 Corpses.\" Mainly due to the poor reviews and the fact it looked like a \"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" rip off. As a matter of fact I wasn't that interested in this movie at first. But the early buzz raised my interest and I went out and saw it. \"The Devil's Rejects\" is a sick, ruthless, grab you by the throat and don't let go horror movie. Which is exactly what it sets out to do and it succeeds brilliantly. While the movie is sadistic and violent, the characters are extremely well developed and the movie is extremely well written. I've always felt that Rob Zombie would make a good horror director and while \"Corpses\" wasn't so well received it was only his first film. This is something else altogether. A genre masterpiece and the best movie I've seen all year. If Zombie keeps this up he will become a force to be reckoned with in the horror genre",
         "I went to this movie having seen 1000 Corpses which I thought was a great retro B style horror in the Texas Chainsaw massacre genre. This movie FAR exceeded any expectation I had. Zombie NAILED it in this one. Classic Freeze frames, awesome soundtrack(used with purpose)-Just enough gore with out going over the top.. the essential random nudity shots that we B fans have come to expect. Suspenseful through-out. I realize that what makes all of these components work: A- This movie (Unlike 99% of all B Horros) is not predictable. You do not know what is going to happen next. B- Zombie builds characters. You learn history and connections, and see things from their view. C- Slight comedic aspect added. Summary: MUST SEE, MUST OWN in the words of my horror loving awe-struck friend \"This is hands down the best B horror I have ever seen!\"",
         "I went into a screening of this movie completely blind. I hadn't seen 1000 Deaths, and I haven't even seen any of Rob Zombie's videos. (I do like his music,BTW) I had essentially no idea what to expect.This movie is what \"Natural Born Killers\" *TRIED* to be. It's \"Kill Bill\" without the nod and wink that this is campy/funny. This movie is intense, violent, gory, gritty, harsh chilling and creepy. The only movie/scene that can compare the intensity to is \"Saving Private Ryan\", particularly the scene where Mellish is slowly stabbed by a German near the end of \"Ryan\". This movie can/will take your breath away. That being said, if you like this sort of thing, the movie is VERY well written, directed and acted. The casting was beautiful. Captain Spaulding, Otis, Lady Firefly are brilliant. Others were also great. I saw this at a private screening with a Q&A with Rob Zombie afterward. The audience experience was odd. Sometimes there would be cheers, only to have them choked off by the next few seconds. This movie kept you on the edge of your seat. There were moments of funniness, and well done comic bits, but this is NOT a comedy. During the Q&A, a gentleman (who said he liked 1000 corpses) described the movie as \"the worst, most violent depraved movie I have ever seen. It glorifies violence...\" This comment received some cheers. Rob replied VERY professionally (quote/paraphrase) \" I think you might have had the perfect response. ...if you want truly depraved, see Cannibal Holocaust or Man Bites Dog... this movies does not glorify the violence, it shows how ugly and nasty it is... I don't want people to cheer the bad guys...\" Bottom line? This movie makes you uncomfortable. It is absolutely, positively NOT FOR EVERYONE!!! It takes a long, hard, ugly look at the exploits of some truly horrible human beings and their affect on their surroundings. It was also done extremely well. If you like this genre, it gets a solid 9. However, due to its general limited appeal, I have to drop it to a 7 overall.",
         "I had the pleasure of previewing this movie a few days before its official release. While I enjoyed \"House of 1,000 Corpses\" I think this follow-up sequel was far better. \"House of 1,000 Corpses\" was more like a carnival freak show with supernatural and unbelievable scenarios, whereas \"The Devil's Rejects\" was quite realistic and very brutal. This film is in the vein of \"Helter Skelter\", and 'Otis' pays homage to Charles Manson, even hauntingly resembling him. \"The Devil's Rejects\" is full of bloody carnage, perversion, filthiness, vulgarity, and the characters are sadistic and relentless serial killers. It is not for the feint of heart or the squeamish. There are some clever and quite humorous lines in the movie, along with some very disturbing ones as well. Sherri Moon Zombie gives a stellar performance as 'Baby' that is quite unforgettable. It was great to see P.J. Soles (Halloween) in this film, still looking beautiful as ever. Leslie Easterland, 'Mama Firefly', really gives an excellent performance as the perverted and disgusting mother of the clan. All of the actors did an amazing job in this movie and were very convincing as their characters. The cinematography of this film was really brilliant, and uses the 'swipe' and 'freeze-frame' methods, sometimes resembling a comic book adventure. The music was classic seventies rock, and fits well with the road trip theme. The gore was spectacular and realistic, and sometimes even disgusted me at times, which is hard to accomplish. I gave this movie a \"10 out of 10\" because it is full of spectacular, clever, and gruesome horror-movie fun! It contains scenes which seriously make the viewer cringe and feel sympathy for the victims, while hating the serial killers. I've never felt so much hatred and disgust towards the villains as I did during this film, and that goes to show you how convincing this movie really is! If you like Rob Zombie, seventies slashers, and a good horror movie plot, with edge of your seat/nail-biting scenes, then this is the movie for you! Check it out, its jaw-droppingly great!",
         "This movie has some classic ingredients for a great horror movie. Interesting characters, some really vile gore scenes, bad language, unnecessary nudity, and some familiar faces; Leslie Easterbrook (from the Police Academy movies), Ken Foree (the original Dawn Of The Dead), 80's pop singer/actress E.G. Daily and Michael Berryman (The Hills Have Eyes) provide more than enough nostalgia for retro junkies, like myself. The story isn't overly fast paced but the gore can be thick and pretty relentless and is at times implied rather than shown which I think adds to the experience. I really enjoyed Leslie Easterbrook as Mother Firefly (replacing Karen Black who was in the first movie, House Of 1000 Corpses). She does some wonderful overacting in her scenes, it's a shame she wasn't in it more, same goes for E.G. Daily who plays a sassy hooker. In fact everyone was great in their parts, let's face it this is not Shakespeare - this is a horror movie, I for one demand hammy over the top performances and a bit of camp! I don't want to give anything away but I will say my favourite scenes involved Mother Firefly and the sheriff, and Captain Spaulding and a mother and child. If you enjoyed House Of 1000 Corpses, this is a superior sequel in my mind and you wont be disappointed. If your idea of horror is a glossy PG-13 rated remake you might want to try weaning yourself onto this kind of movie with something a little less extreme.",
         "OK. I saw \"House of 1000 Corpses\" and thought it an utterly useless, TCM rip-off. But I heard better things about this one, so I went in with an open mind. Unlike Rob Zombie, who does not seem to have an original, or even fresh thought in his head. Otis the crackhead psycho from \"House\" becomes a Charlie Manson wannabe in this one, and Sheri Moon is the least convincing \"bad\" girl I have ever seen. This film first rips off \"Last house on the left\" with the humiliation/rape/murder scene in the Hotel, with the vapid Sheri Moon ordering one of the female captives to hit the other in the face, hard. Lady, you ain't no David Hess. You are not fit to lace up Jeramie Rain's Keds, for that matter. We meander to an out of the way bordello, so that we may crib from \"From Dusk til Dawn\". The film tries to marry '70's grind to films such as \"Natural born Killers\", with flat attempts to mimic Tarantino-esquire witty repartee. Bill Mosely might have been up to that task, but remember, he's channeling Charlie, and has proclaimed himself the Devil. I guess he's too hardcore for humour. We have a sheriff who seems to be a direct rip-off from the cop gone bad from NBK, and the Dennis Hopper religious, insane Texas Ranger from the funny TCM sequel (Forget which one, hope you get the point.) We also get a Pimp, a \"Bandito\", and other stock Tarantino characters. Finally, this crap ends in a \"Bonnie and Clyde\" style shootout. Sheri Moon is also no Faye Dunaway. Every thing Zombie did in his two movies was ripping off every thing you have seen before. Some call it homage. I call it complete lack of talent. There's a good deal of gore, and of course violence, but Zombie tries to paint his villains as anti-heros, and fails utterly, so the grind is all for naught. Oh, and Rob? Thanks for ruining \"Freebird\" for me. Zombie's movies seem like an excuse to give his old lady some work. I grew weary of seeing her posterior. Sheri Moon, you ain't no Tiffany Minx, but porn is surely where you belong. Caveat Emptor on this one.",
         "sorry, this is not a good film. simply setting up a bunch of people for violent, miserable death and torture, zombie has no tale to tell and no point to make. as far as i remember nobody survives, not that it matters, which seems to be the point of this childish, inept exercise in ersatz nihilism. (actually, i may be wrong there... can't quite recall, but isn't there some hulking deformed fellow who comes to the director's wife's rescue and then... ohh, i really can't be bothered.) a lot of superannuated infants would have one believe that this film is 'sick' and 'depraved' to it's credit. it's not. while it is definitely deserving of both those adjectives it is still no good whatsoever. torture, humiliation, smashed-in heads and a clattering, numb-skull soundtrack might be your delight, i don't know, but i hope it isn't, for your sake. and naming these things as credits is just silly. it's a film that makes you feel bad, not for it's characters but for the world we live in and that we will be shortly leaving to our children. a world where watching supposed versions of ourselves being ripped apart, both literally and figuratively, is regarded as entertainment. horror has a place, sure, and good horror films are good films first. that they horrify means they've succeeded, but they have to have quality in the first place to do that. merely dealing out death and misery and pouring cancerous moral bleakness into our parietal lobes succeeds in nothing but fulfilling only the needs and curious desires of those blank-headed children mentioned earlier - the ones who slow down to see who got caved in in a multiple pile-up but who would, presumably, prefer not to suffer the indignity of being the crushed person being so voyeuristically studied. don't ask me what makes a good horror film, specifically - if i knew that i would be making one rather than typing this - but it's clear for (nearly) all to see what makes a bad one. this film could be a textbook for those looking to do just that. but do go see it if you like this kind of thing. it is, after all, aimed directly at you.",
         "I think this movie is sick. Was there a \"good guy\" in the movie before the last scene? I doubt it. Although to quasi-quote most of the people commenting on this film \"if you like murder, gore, sadism, torture, brains splattered on asphalt, and women wearing masks made from the faces of their dead husbands, then you'll love this movie.\" So I guess the Fireflies are kind of \"good guys\". At least they're heroes. Well, that makes me think the people saying that really think what the heroes were doing in the movie was really cool. Just awesome. I mean, ain't it cool when some guy whacks another guy in the nuts with a big log and then crushes his skull before taunting a guy who's bleeding to death from a bullet-wound in his neck and torturing him? That's a lot of fun. Of course we would never do those things, no. Maybe people are just scared to sound too \"conservative\". Well, wouldn't it be better if people were scared to even let the thought enter their minds that killing is really cool, especially when it's sadistic. Wouldn't it be better if movies showed people what really happens in the lives of murderers like the Fireflies? That it isn't a game that ends heroically with the perpetrators true to each other until the very end (the film does a good job showing the love and dedication the murderers feel towards one another). Anyone who's read info about serial killers know they go through cycles--fantasy, murder, guilt and shame, fantasy, murder, guilt and shame...until it finally gets to them, and they are caught and have nothing to do but confess that they knew full well that what they were doing was wrong. A movie like this could be good if it showed all the horrific psychology behind serial murders. But this one doesn't. It attempts to make you \"feel for\" the murderers; the victims come across as rather stupid; the sheriff who tries to bring the \"heroes\" to justice fails miserably, and it seems the viewer should almost rejoice when he dies, because he's a sick weirdo. But wait a minute, that's what the \"heroes\" are. But the heroes are cooler, they know what their doing, and they're much better at humiliating people. They're pros. I mean, the sheriff is killing for revenge (how lame) but the fireflies are killing for fun (coool!). Otis taunts a decent man who's praying and says he should tell God to send down lightning. God doesn't, and Otis goes on to sarcastically repent. Truth be told, God would not force a man like Otis to repent. If I were the man whom Otis was taunting, I would say. \"Otis, you choose hell. God will not force you to do otherwise.\" Otis rejected everything good and bright in the world for a life of hatred and running away. There is nothing good in him. Even those things which would appear good stem from selfishness. He \"loves\" his OWN family. And that's it. The amount of crap he does in the film cover that all up. He chose hell, he chose to do what he knew was wrong and evil. He knew right from wrong, human from animal. He chose the latter in both cases (along with the other members of his family). If you think that's cool, you have a really big problem. Lucio Argento said in his post that there is no rape scene in the movie so it's a fine movie. Whatever Lucio, what is it with so many people nowadays? A porn flick has much more redeeming value than this crap. And the movie says straight out that Captain Spaulding raped some kid cheerleader (although that's sort of okay, because it was a girl he raped, not a boy). So what, it doesn't show it in the movie! Come on there's no rape scene. Okay, then the movie is really good! But really, it's all irrelevant. I saw a French/Belgian movie called Du Kus (The Kiss). It had a rape scene in it. But the girl in the end got away from the man (a pimp) and got her life together. It was a really good movie that showed the horrors of prostitution. But Mr. Argento would disagree. It had a rape scene. The devil's rejects is a much better movie. It doesn't have a rape scene. Lady Saphria in her post called this film \"art looking into the deeper darker side of our human nature.\" \"Our\" human nature? What the hell are you talking about? I'm sure a lot of people agree with you Ms. Saphria, most are in maximum security prisons. Don't watch this film. If you go to the theatre and feel compelled to leave don't be ashamed to get up and walk out. Ignore the scoffs of your friends and others in the theatre who think that knowingly, purposefully doing what's wrong is cool. But you do what you feel is right. Knowlingly, purposefully. The world will be a better place.",
         "I am a horror fan. There is something about a stylish thriller that I think we all enjoy. However, anyone that appreciates a good thriller appreciates the style, suspense and craft that goes into a worthwhile film. I checked this film out on IMDb before I rented because I hated \"House of 1000 corpses\". Now that I have seen it I am stunned that it got a 7.0. WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE??? This is simply an exercise in sadism. There is nothing enjoyable or suspenseful about cruel, nasty material done in an ugly way. I almost turned the \"movie\" off after the sickening humiliation of Priscilla Barnes, but I figured if I was going to express an opinion I should see the entire movie. What a mistake that was! Everyone involved in this sickening, vile mess should be deeply ashamed. Please...Someone tell me the point of this repugnant pile of self-serving crap! How does this get made??? How does this get financed??? And REALLY, how do you people find anything entertaining about this nasty exercise in brutality??? This \"film\" wallows in its own grotesque ugliness. There is no point, no art, no entertainment, no craft, no suspense and no reason. Rob Zombie has now assembled two of the most pointless, nasty, ugly, vile excuses for a movie ever made. I seriously don't want to be in a room with anyone who really enjoyed this rancid, pathetic piece of trash. There is real craft out there. Seek it out. This is the kind of thing that makes me lose all faith in people. This speaks volumes about how the rest of the world sees us in this country. It is my hope that Rob Zombie will never again have the finances at his disposal to construct another affront to the sensibilities of everyone but the criminally insane. If you are a real fan of horror stay clear of Mr. Zombie's sick masturbatory daydreams and seek out some masters of the craft. I suggest some Dario Argento. I sincerely hope that my comments don't make someone want to see this trash. I can imagine someone thinking \"If it's that bad I have to see what all the fuss is about\". Don't bother. You will just feel like you are covered in a thick slimy film that can't be washed off.",
         "by Dane Youssef Rob Zombie is without a doubt one of the most versatile and true-to-his-genre artists out there. \"The Devil's Rejects\" is the kind of movie uptight censors and worried parents always warned you was gonna get made some day. A movie where the leads are psychopathic murderers, the violence is excess and the gore is so voluminous, that you have to ask: \"Does this movie satirize this kind of sadism... or celebrate it? Is it a fun campy parody... or a sign that we may have gone too far with our ultra-violent-based entertainment?\" This movie actually defines the term \"overkill.\" Three of the more interesting deranged killers from \"House Of 1000 Corpses\" get their own spin-off in the \"Frasier\" or \"Jeffersons\" tradition. The three, who are a family, actually (a father and his son and daughter) go on a mass killing spree and are racing out of the country to legal freedom on the other side of the border. They seem to echo the Manson Family. Their sense of humor is the kind of acquired taste like the movie itself has. It stems from the experience you'd get from... watching slasher movies throughout a lot of your life. Like lime green Jell-O, anchovies, fish eggs and black licorice, this is not for all tastes. The movie is actually a lot smarter and more complex than you might imagine, if you're unfamiliar with what Zombie's movies are about. It's akin to films like \"From Dusk 'Til Dawn,\" \"Vulgar,\" \"Desperado\" and \"Freaked.\" If you like these types of \"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" and \"Friday the 13th\" re-vamping in the video-geek traditions, here is a movie you may hold up as one for the history books. The dialogue is written a twisted brilliant way and the direction has a real retro-'70's homey-quality to it. In a way that doesn't feel contrived. Sid Haig, Bill Moseley and Sheri Moon are all so perfectly demented in their roles, you have to wonder what they're like in real life. You pray they're nothing like they are here... and hope you never come across anyone remotely like this either. Sheri Moon, wife of director Zombie, looks more like a typical American model-actress than the degenerate rank-skank she plays here. Moseley is real-life, was actually a columnist and Heig often played scuzzy thugs, but played the judge in Tarantino's \"Jackie Brown.\" I find it incredibly strange that some people seem to be COMPLAINING that the pursuing cop character (the sheriff, John Quincy Wydell) is as sadistic and mentally unbalanced as the family killers themselves. Why? Yes, he is. But... why? Why is that a bad thing? In any way at all? Look, if there's anything history and government have taught us, it's that it takes one to catch one. Not just in the movies, but in life. And not just in real life, but in movies as well. You see, it's not just an opinion. It's a fact. It's the way of the world. People... do we all not remember Tommy Lee Jones in \"The Fugitive\"? His I-Will-Catch-him-By-Any-Means-Nessicary-Law Enforcer way was one of the true milestones in the movie, and it got him an Oscar. Would we want any of the other major characters to be far less interesting than the leads? When you eat a meal of any kind, you don't just want a rich main course and the side dishes to be as tasteless as styraphone. You want a whole meal you can taste. And the stuff with the sheriff and the rest of the cops IS something to see. Why? Because he isn't any kind of undeveloped character. Zombie made him (and everything else) just as big, broad, colorful and energetic as the '70's genre that this one stems from. There's some humor with the Kentucky-Fried Sheriff and the rest of his \"Good Ol' Boys\" in Blue. It goes without saying that in a small town, the cops are all red-necked. The way the stereotype of the small-town cop in a campy-slasher pic is handled with more laughs than usual. And there's a great moment where they call in a specialist, a film historian (see: uber film geek) to help them with the investigation and this film critic.... well, suffice to say, he insults the name of God in the house of the Lord and that's all I'm gonna say. We all know Zombie is a neo-talent outside of the music biz. He did the LSD effect in \"Beavis & Butthead Do America.\" The end may justify the means, in this case. The hick cops and the colorful killers... in the end, it's an ending we all knew we deserved. Speaking of Zombie, his film debut \"House of 1000 Corpses,\" was a film I found to be embarrassingly bad. I'm a fan of those types of rock-horror camp movies in the \"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" and \"House Of Wax\" vein. SEVERED vein, in this case. But everything was played out so campy, so cheaply, so maudlin, so without suspense... that Zombie, I felt, made a movie that seems to be an insult, rather than a tribute to those horror-show camp classics. But he's redeemed himself with this one. He's working without a net and it all could have gone horribly, pathetically wrong. So I give him props. BIG, BIG PROPS. As I'm writing this now, he's currently re-making \"Halloween.\" Though I wish he wouldn't, really. Why re-paint the Mona Lisa? Give it eyebrows, what? Will that REALLY be an improvement? Brace yourself. Not for all tastes. Procceed with caution. Use extreme care. NOT FOR THE FAINT-HEARTED, SQUEAMISH, PRUDISH... OR TOO MORAL. by Dane Youssef"
