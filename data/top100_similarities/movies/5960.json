         "Now that Curtis Hanson is on the Hollywood A-List after the excellent neo-noir \"L.A. Confidential\", perhaps \"Bad Influence\" will be re-discovered for what it is, a contemporary noir classic. Michael, played by James Spader, is one step away from a nervous breakdown. His fiancee is planning a wedding he is none-to-thrilled about, while his career is at a crossroads. Someone will get that key promotion, but Michael won't unless he can find his schedule report which has mysteriously disappeared. He suspects his work rival, Patterson, but is too much of a wimp to confront him. He has been doubling up in pain from what he thinks is an ulcer from the stress. He leaves work for a fateful drink at a beach dive bar. He lamely hits on a woman, whose boyfriend Michael does not back down from. Michael gets saved by Alex or Tony (?), played by Rob Lowe, who menacingly breaks a beer bottle and threatens the boyfriend. Alex we see at the beginning of the movie as leaving a beautiful woman's bed stealthily. The photo he destroys of him and the woman shooting guns together foreshadows the violence that comes later. Alex leaves Michael at the bar and Michael discovers his wallet is gone, but does not know how he lost it. While jogging later, Alex stops by the bar to leave his name for the wallet. He finishes his run at one of the L.A. piers, he sees Alex, who, of course, is with a woman pleading with him to stay with her. Alex blows off the woman and he and Michael have a drink together. Alex starts teaching him how to use the side of him that didn't back down to the gorilla at the bar. What ensues is a Freudian Cain and Abel story with Faustian overtones. Alex becomes Michael's tutor in the art of becoming a bad-ass, while Michael becomes something Alex hasn't had in quite some time: a friend. When Michael's backbone becomes strong enough to stand up to the unpredictably violent Alex, the movie becomes a cunning duel between two guys who know L.A. isn't big enough for both of them. The scenes of L.A.'s sinister club life and the people, like Alex, who thrive in it serve as superb snapshots of the decadence of the late-80s. The conspicuous consumption of yuppies and the advent of the home video camera as a sexual metaphor are wickedly exposed. This movie was simply ahead of its time. It's Rob Lowe's best work and James Spader is awesome, his transformation is expertly done. Plus, I'm eagerly awaiting Curtis Hanson's next movie. Has anyone ever captured the evil that lurks underneath the surface of L.A. better? \"Bad Influence\" is a must-see for the serious film enthusiast.",
         "\"Bad Influeince:\" Yup, that's a good title for one of the main characters in this movie: \"Alex,\" played by Rob Lowe. His grin alone is pure evil! In fact, Lowe's character is one of the lowest I've encountered in these modern-day thrillers. This also could be called a modern \"noir,\" because it has a lot of that genre's qualities. This also is different from the normal cops-vs.- crooks film. As bad as \"Alex\" was, I couldn't root for the other main character, either: \"Michael Boll\" (James Spader). Spader is one of these actors that seems to play very snotty, unlikeable people. Maybe he's just good at play annoying characters. An odd character, and one that added to this film, was the guy (Christian Clemenson) who played Spader's older, stoned-out brother \"Pismo.\" What a loser.....but an interesting person. I really was intrigued by this film the first time I saw it but less so in the next two viewings, finally trading this in for something else. But for one viewing, it's recommended for crime fans, or people who just plain like evil characters.",
         "This is the most textbook demonstration of Nietzsche I've ever seen. Rob Lowe is the gifted liar prepared to go all the way to get whatever he wants and keep himself entertained. Spader is the timid, uptight yuppie who doesn't understand just how much he's in for when Lowe's \"will to power\" rubs off on him. What ensues would bring anybody back to good old fashioned organized religion. A morality play taken to extremes that nonetheless works as a thriller, too. Worth seeing. 8.",
         "To me this movie was about a lifestyle. The music in this movie was very underground and featured Skinny Puppy tracks ('Who's Laughing Now?')along with a host of other interesting songs. The main dance-floor scene was very well done and gave a glimpse into the underworld of recreation drugs. Rob Lowe and James Spader delivered convincing roles and were a perfect fit for this cult classic. I'm still looking for the song featured on this movie with the lyrics \"I wanna take you down\"... It was cool. The movie was cool. Guess you have to appreciate the music at one point in your life to appreciate this type of movie... regards...",
         "\"Bad Influence\" is about an innocent person who's drawn into the control of a character who disguises his real nature by pretending to be motivated purely by a desire to help the hapless victim. The gullible male in this case suffers as a result of befriending a guy who initially seems to be a charismatic Good Samaritan but is later revealed to be a dangerous psychopath who takes great pleasure in doing all that he can to ruin his \"friend's\" life. Michael Boll (James Spader) is an ambitious marketing analyst who's doing well in his job but comes up against a problem when one of his colleagues sabotages his work by wiping one of his most important files off the company's computer system. Michael's a rather diffident person who has no idea how to deal with this predicament and also has an additional problem, as he doesn't want to marry his posh fiancée. When he goes to a nearby bar to console himself with a beer, he gets caught up in an altercation with a violent customer who holds his head down against the bar but fortunately a good-looking stranger comes to his rescue. The stranger, who's called Alex (Rob Lowe) and Michael soon become friends and Alex makes it his business to show Michael how to overcome some of his problems. This results in Michael successfully turning the tables on his scheming work rival and freeing himself from his fiancée. Michael's sense of liberation and empowerment is profound but doesn't stop there because, through his new friendship, he soon gets involved in nightclubbing, doing drugs and enjoying some \"no commitment\" sex. Alex turns out to be a mystery man who uses a variety of names, doesn't seem to have any commitments and adopts a number of different accents. The wild behaviour that he and Michael indulge in gets more serious when they rob a series of convenience stores. This makes Michael uncomfortable when he has time to reflect on his actions but when he tries to free himself from his friendship with Alex, things turn ugly and he soon finds himself framed for a murder he didn't commit. The methods that Michael uses to restore some sanity to his life are both ironic in nature and entertaining to watch. This movie has a good sense of time and place as Michael is a typical 1980s style yuppie with an impressive apartment, lots of expensive possessions and a strong appetite for improving his status. Alex, on the other hand, is a dedicated pleasure seeker who's manipulative and completely amoral. Whilst Michael is initially repressed and passive, Alex is very confident and has no inhibitions whatsoever and the hedonistic and decadent behaviour that they indulge in is also symptomatic of 1980s affluence and excess. \"Bad Influence\" is an intriguing thriller which features a couple of interesting characters, plenty of suspense and excellent performances from Rob Lowe and James Spader. Spader is particularly good at conveying Michael's anxiety, naivety and discomfort in certain situations and Lowe conveys Alex's combination of charm and menace very effectively. The action is delivered at a good pace and there are also some humorous moments to enjoy.",
         "Bad Influence is directed by Curtis Hanson and written by David Koepp. It stars Rob Lowe, James Spader, Lisa Zane and Christian Clemenson. Music is by Trevor Jones and cinematography by Robert Elswit. Michael Boll (Spader) is the ultimate milquetoast. Alex (Lowe) is something altogether different. When Alex introduces himself into Michael's life, Michael finds from within a boldness he didn't know existed. But Alex's life lessons may just come at a cost... Tell me what you want more than anything else in the world. The 90s began in a neo-norish haze for one time brat-packers Spader and Lowe. For Spader it was another chance to show, after 1989's Sex, Lies and Videotape, that he could do drama very well. For Lowe it was a case of dusting off his off screen misdemeanours to self mockingly portray the bad boy playing the bad boy. With future L.A. Confidential helmer Hanson in the chair overseeing things, Bad Influence rounded out as a sneaky bit of grit. It didn't make any great waves back on release, but it's a film that holds up surprisingly well these days, particularly as an 80s noir snapshot. Thematically picture asks us if everyone has the devil inside them if prompted or manipulated from outside sources? Alex's motives are intentionally left sketchy, we are in no doubt from the opening credits that he's untrustworthy, yet who he is or what he's really about are questions left hanging in the air. A good looking charmer without doubt, and thanks to Spader's uber wimp beginnings, we find ourselves urging Alex on as he slots a spine into Michael's back. There's a decidedly nasty edge to the Koepp screenplay that lets the actors excel in their respective transformations, and with the mood set at simmer, story unfolds and lets the Doppleganger motif kick in. From here on in it's now a question for the viewers of how it's going to resolve itself? Call me Mick. Hanson paints it in sweaty metallic strokes, interiors of Michael's condo portray yuppie claustrophobia, exteriors of nighttime L.A. are classic noir; where the bright lights of the city are eyes observing Michael's transformation and the salty whiff of the pier and the sea hover over the telling periods of dialogue. True enough to say that Bad Influence, and its director, owe a huge debt to past masters, notably something like Strangers on a Train, but the update works very well, particularly in the context of maintaining a continued sense of tension. The humour that lives and breathes in the picture is nicely placed, adding a bit of salt to an already spicy broth, and there's even the delicate hint of an old noir favourite, potential man crush. The build up isn't matched by the pay off, but even then there's enough of a bite to warrant respect. Far better than some internet ratings suggest it is, and certainly undervalued in the neo-noir pantheon, Bad Influence is well worth reevaluating in this new age of cinema. 7.5/10",
         "Rob Lowe plays the strikingly good looking GQ styled stranger who befriends an affluent wimp named Michael. He also introduces him to evil, threesomes and robbery. You never know why Rob Lowe does what he does(maybe it's sexual?) but it doesn't spell it out for you. He even tapes him while having sex so Alex clearly has a sexual power over Michael. Rob Lowe in his early movies was just a pretty boy who had cool hair but he was awesome in this movie. He taped himself having sex with minors just two years before this movie(he's facing his demons in this one). Oh well, Rob Lowe was the movie. Billy Zane's sister is ridiculously goodlooking and she has the mysterious, sexy look which makes her perfect in this. One question though, what is up with his stoner brother? The actor was pathetic and he looked like a librarian. He wasn't even necessary and his stupid scenes ate up time that we could have had more of the Rob Lowe-James Spader dynamic. That was bad casting but other than that this movie owns.",
         "This psychological thriller, puts a spin on it's story, compared to other thrillers around this time. Here's a new wave original, the first film I actually saw to start off 91, and I must say, I was not the least bit disappointed. Actually shown at the cinema, in it's M version, it's R version which I saw, made me glad to wait, till it hit VHS, which was primarily the reason I hired it. Wimpy yuppie Spader avoids a close shave with this big rough dude, in a bar, after discreetly trying to crack onto the girlfriend, although Spader, wasn't aware he was around. Not backing down, at the sound of a beer bottle cracking, in steps new dude, psychopathic, manipulative and charming Alex (Rob Lowe in his best role yet). He forms a friendship with Spader showing him how to live, but he doesn't know where this is leading. Michael (Spader) soon realizes Alex's fun can get out of control, costing him some embarrassment, a marriage, where he inexplicably gets involved in a robbery while intoxicated, where the final show has him been set up by Alex, for a murder, all of it Alex's spared amusement, until Spader, with help from his geeky drug addicted brother, who I liked, must outwit him and if necessary kill him. Lowe does help him though, overthrow a rival worker, who's been involved in some funny business at work, where later he's beaten up by Lowe. Now this rival buries his head, when he sees Spader in the hallway of their workplace. Violence is occasional but BI is a well steered machine, intelligently written with some smart dialogue, and Lowe's chillingly cool performance is worth the rental fee. Koepp went onto to wrote the 2002 hit, Panic Room. Marcia Cross, way before her Desperate Housewife days, is really cute as Spader's disgraced girlfriend.",
         "James Spader again plays the yuppie character (Michael)whose comfortable but numb existence is thrown into chaos and then danger after meeting up with insane psycho drifter Rob Lowe (Alex). Michael has money, career prospects and a wealthy fiancée who he really does not love. Early scenes portray him as an intelligent but timid man who is henpecked by his wife to be and outsmarted by a sneaky co-worker in the race for a job promotion. Alex saves Michael from a bar room beating and when they meet up again Alex begins to pull Michael into the dark underbelly of the rich side of Los Angeles. At first Michael is happy to have Alex rearrange his life even managing to help abort his wedding plans in a hilarious scene. But when Alex beats up Michaels rival for the job promotion, claiming that an intoxicated Michael participated in the beating the friendship comes to an end. From this point on the mission for Alex is to destroy Michaels life ultimately framing him for a murder which is shown in an excellent \"death by video\" scene. Rob Lowes maniacal laughter as he stares into the camera post murder still chills me to the bone. From this point on it is a race to see who stays alive as Michael finally grows the balls that Alex had previously taunted him about. Another highlight is the eclectic musical score ranging from the LA underground club scene (Skinny Puppy, The Nymphs) to Etta James. Finally nice to see that the DVD has restored the bomb rigged to the car petrol tank scene. When the movie first came out on video in the UK the sensor removed this scene in case it was copied by someone!",
         "Who wouldn't be taken in by Rob Lowe's good looks and charm, at least in this movie. Here he plays Alex (although that might not be his name) who convinces Michael (James Spader) to take a grip on his life, although not in a conventional way, and go after what he really wants. Obviously we're meant to feel for Spader, first as he's led through the LA underground scene that he doesn't understand or fit into, and then as his life falls apart when Alex is angry that he's no longer wanted in Spader's yuppie life. However, Spader plays his character so flat that its ever so much more fun to watch Lowe play the maniacal murderer and laugh along with him. When his last lines are delivered, just a touch cheesily, they're true: everyone has a dark side that they don't want to acknowledge. This movie either tried to make you fear that side, or get in touch with it, but the makers weren't all that clear on what they wished you to do. If it was to get in touch with it, they pointed out rather blatantly what would happen if you do (although to share that would be to give away the ending.) I'd like to point out one thing, though. This movie could have been made with less sex and nudity and probably have been just as effective (were they making a psychological thriller or soft porn?) Either way, it was a good movie, if a *bit* on the predictable side."
