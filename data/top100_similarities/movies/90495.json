         "Ostensible shades of a Hawk The Slayer reunion are evidenced here with two of that films main protagonists (Peter O'Farrell and Ray Charleson) present here in very similar roles to that which they portrayed in the aforementioned movie. In fact the film reviewed here bears more than a passing resemblance to the said glorious classic in many ways (a compliment indeed!) The plot concerns a revolutionary scientist who develops an amazing device which can transport matter to another dimension. Predictably matters take a turn for the worse when himself, a female TV presenter and a handy man/kendo champion(!) accidentally fall into the device and inevitably end up stranded in an unforgiving parallel world ruled by a sadistic despot named Kleel (the always excellent John Saxon) It turns out to be a highly enjoyable ride throughout boasting some great action set pieces including some very well staged battles wherein our hero, played by Richard 'Apollo' Hatch, demonstrates some highly nifty sword work! Great fun from start to finish and can be enjoyed by all. It's just such a shame that films like this are so rarely made nowadays.",
         "This is by no stretch of the imagination a good movie. It is incredibly low-budget, and that leaves the OK(ish) acting badly exposed. That said, I thoroughly loved it! To enjoy this movie you really have to be able to overlook the low budget. The \"effects\" are bad. Really bad. The alien dimension is an exact replica of Earth. The sets could come straight from a spaghetti western (perhaps they did). The \"monsters\" are people in mild fancy dress. The fight scenes are amateurish, and made more \"exciting\" by running the film faster. A three year old child could spot it without even trying. However, if you can accept the shortfalls for what they are � the result of an extremely low budget and an overreaching ambition � and allow yourself to ride with the tide, you will enjoy this film. The saving graces come in the form of a fun script and Kay Lenz. The script is not magnificently written, but the dialogue is fun and counterpoints many amusing incidents in the storyline. I won't highlight any incidents as I want this post to remain spoiler-free. However, if you relax into this movie and roll with it you will discover them for yourself when you find yourself laughing out loud � and you will perhaps be surprised that you are laughing with the movie, not at it. Kay Lenz is also fun. If you like your heroines good looking and feminine but sparky, you will love her character. Having a female lead character in a film who looks like this, and is possessed of intelligence and verve, will always add a certain frisson for many male viewers. I always find that one of the marks of a movie that has been particularly enjoyable is that at the ending I am surprised that so much time has passed whilst I was watching. This film met that criterion. It is refreshing to find this in a low-budget movie after sitting through some Hollywood blockbuster or other wondering how much longer it will be before the interminable film ends. If you want to watch a fun bubblegum movie, and you are willing and able to overlook a budget so low that it hits you in the face thirty times per minute of running time, take a look at this film. You will have fun.",
         "This film is very different sci-fi/fantasy film that has good action scenes and some very unique but original characters. Kay Lenz is so good looking! She looked great in this movie and she acted good too! John Saxon put on powerful performance. I really liked his character. Richard Hatch was good as well. If you can find this different film some where pick it up and I don't think you'll be disappointed.",
         "This stereotypical, low-grade fantasy lacks both the budget and the directorial imagination to be really exciting. The only epic thing about it is the music score. The film is too cheesy for most adults, but it also has some unpleasant scenes that are unsuitable for kids - making you wonder what audience exactly they had in mind. What kept me watching it is Kay Lenz: she's both endearing and feisty, and she looks particularly sexy when she's angry. Her face has a great \"bone structure\" - she looks a bit like Kim Basinger (trivia note: they were born the same year, 1953), only more beautiful. And she can even keep a straight face through lines like \"But....he's green!\" (when the male lead suggests that they should follow a man). Take Lenz out of the movie and you don't have a movie - just a midget, a giant, an evil John Saxon, and other stereotypes. (*1/2)",
         "I've now watched this movie twice. The first time I stumbled across it in one of those packs of DVDs that has 50 obscure movies you've never heard of. I went in fully intending to mock it throughout. I was pretty happy early on watching the main characters all come together. Then as the movie progressed, I realized there was a real plot, and some well thought out ideas. There are colorful characters, and some pretty interesting ideas in this thing. I also have an appreciation for the strong female lead in this movie. It's very welcome. When you absorb it all, you have to allow for low budget, sometimes odd dialogue, and occasionally slow pacing. If you look at the variety of characters, follow their travels and enjoy the campiness that is built in, you should have a good time. This is an earnest movie throughout, and I love it for that. I have no doubt I'll watch it again in the future. The story involves (although you may have read this already) a scientist, a reporter, and a guy who just happened to be in the neighborhood. Through a series of events, they all wind up in another dimension. The goal is simple. Find out if there is a way to get home, and if so, go for it. This movie is the tale of their adventures. Aside from some language, it's definitely family friendly. The violence is modest by todays standards and mostly consists of swordplay. Pop in that DVD and enjoy. You'll be glad you did!",
         "First, I can't imagine this can even be found anymore. I saw it one time, in the mid 80s when I was a kid, on T.V. I think it was orginally made for cable. Anyway, my expectations were zero, and instead I enjoyed a great \"bad\" movie, if you know what I mean. Fun way to spend an afternoon. Why do I even remember it? Because it is so obscure, it is one of those movies I use to test whether a film book (like Maltin) is really comprehensive. Glad to find it on imdb.com.",
         "\"A scientist has developed a matter transmitter that he is able to demonstrate for two people, when an earthquake occurs, disrupting the test and plunging the trio into a parallel universe. The trio must adjust to the strange new world, where medieval weaponry is mixed with modern technology, all the while trying to find a way to travel back home. The scientist becomes separated from the young couple and they attempt to find him, all the while a warlord is trying to stop them, so he can take the young woman for his own,\" according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis. Richard Hatch (as Dan) and Kay Lenz (as Carrie) are both athletic and attractive, in this vapid and vacuous parallel universe adventure. In Terry Marcel's \"Prisoners of the Lost Universe\", Mr. Hatch and Ms. Lenz get to say naughtier words than they said on episodic television; and, of course, they banter before falling in love. The strange universe looks exactly like our Earth; however, it populated with amusingly costumed and made-up actors. It looks like it should have been a lot more fun. ** Prisoners of the Lost Universe (1983) Terry Marcel ~ Richard Hatch, Kay Lenz, John Saxon",
         "There's this silly scientist (Kenneth Hendel), you see, who has managed to create a machine, a Material Transmitter, which can, well, transmit stuff into a parallel universe. And then there's this female reporter (Kay Lentz), see, who's gonna do a report of the man and then there's this ken-do fighting cable guy (Richard Hatc), who because of an accident gets hooked up in this and they all are like sent into a parallel universe. And in the parallel universe there's some green dude (Ray Charleson), a giant (Larry Taylor), an annoying little thief (Peter O'Farrell) and this, like, evil warlord (John Saxon). And guess who's gonna get napped by the warlord and who is gonna do inventions for him. And who's gonna safe the day. Prisoners Of The Lost Universe is my first camp movie love. When I was a kid I must have watched it dozens of times, even tough it is flat out silly film, whit poor settings and obviously small effect budget. That is the reason I am a bit too generous with my score. POTLU isn't nothing more, than a low budget action/sci-fi/fantasy flick, which, if you are into this kind of films, will make a grin on your face just because it is, what it is. And, at least in the first viewing, you can't help but to applaud for the inner logic of the story and the world. A pod gun. Black and white red eyes pygmies, hot stone worshipers and much, much more. In a word, if you are watching this film, you most likely are into low budget camp films, and thus can appreciate this film for what it is. Score: 4 of 10, Camp Score: 7 of 10",
         "I can accept that the main characters in this movie are lost and that they become prisoners, but whether this is a separate universe is barely pertinent. Same trees, same animals, same language. Just insert a Hyperborian culture and the necessary mystical villain and you have a reason for Richard Hatch to swing a sword. Two big things lacking in the budget - props and a director of photography. The sword the hero swings looks like a scrap of chrome, cut to form. The shots throughout reminded me of a soap opera. Probably, these fight scenes are just like the fight scenes from every big-budget blockbuster, with the difference being, the scenes in this movie are from one angle, motionless, and not edited for any effect. Somewhere between properly-staged cinema and poorly-staged theater, you find movies like this, which in addition to lack of funding for any of the special stuff that movies rely on, has no pacing, no urgency, and mostly, no universe. The action themes were nice, but the silly parts of the score like when bad guys are thrown from a cliff really missed the comedic mark. I mean, really, were those pennywhistles and kazoos?",
         "I remember watching this movie when I was a child in the 80s! Recently, as a birthday present for my dad, I bought him a 100 movie pack SciFi classics (can be found on Amazon). Upon looking through the DVDs, I saw this one and remembered it from when I was little. Sure enough, I found it just as good as I remembered it then except I acknowledge how campy it is. But I still love it! Anyway, if you want this movie, it is available in the 100 movie pack/SCIFI Classics which is selling for about $39.99. NOTE: the quality is basically as if someone took the original movie and just transferred it onto DVD. There's no touch-ups or remastering. Each DVD contains about 4 movies, 2 on each side. Have fun watching! I did!!"
