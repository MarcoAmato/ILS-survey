It has a message, BUT could be a bad message for today's world. Because how the event was dealt with the story only encourages the crime, in reality. Wise people can say philosophically, morally, but not means every words practically applicable. The common people would get affected more. Other than that, I have no grudge on anything. If it has been just a fantasy and an entertaining film, excluding that Christian thing, I would have liked it better.\r\n\r\nIt was more like another 'What Dreams May Come', but less visual spectacular. On the other hand, there was an uneasiness in the development of what happened in the early stage of the story. They did not go for the detail, from the crime perspective, hence that mysterious event holds the key which we don't know exactly what happened to judge anything out of the film. So that part reminds 'The Lovely Bones'.\r\n\r\nThe story of a father whose little girl mysteriously disappeared on a camping trip. Now the struggling father to cope with the incident gets an invitation to meet the creators. His journey to the other side of the world, where he goes through a series of unexpected tests, and at the end, how his character changes are told in those remaining parts.\r\n\r\nWorthington, Spencer, everybody was good. But the story is what I did not like. Like it was aimed for Christians only. But I believe not every Christian would agree with this story. I felt it was an unnecessary film. If it was fun like 'Bruce Almighty', the whole world would have enjoyed it. Too serious and very not acceptable message led this film to fall. No, it is not worth a watch for people with the open mind, unless this is what you were looking for.\r\n\r\n_3/10_",

      "synopsis": "A 13-year-old boy named Mack disembarks from a school bus and runs home. He is a farm boy in the USA mid-west. When he gets home he sees his father abusing his mother, and then him when he tries to defend her. Mack's father is a church deacon and a closeted alcoholic. Mack walks past the house of a woman (Octavia Spencer) who offers him milk and cookies. She advises him to talk to God and that he's done nothing wrong. That Sunday at church, he gains the courage to go up to the alter and ask for prayer. He confesses to the elder that he is sorry for not being able to protect his mother. Later that night at home, Mack's drunk of a father beats him during a rainstorm, making him recite Bible verses. Mack mixes strychnine with his booze, killing him. Cut to an adult Mack (Sam Worthington). He is married to Nan and has three children: Kate, Josh, and Missy. Flashforward, it is winter and Mack is shoveling the snow. He receives a letter in his mailbox from Papa telling him he misses him and inviting him to the shack. He slips on the ice ad has a flashback: Flashback to the family going on a camping trip. Mack tells his children, especially his youngest daughter Missy, a story about a princess sacrificing herself to help save the people of her land. The waterfall they are looking at are the tears of the princess's father. They are singing around the campfire with another group that evening. Missy runs and tells him that he has to say his prayers to Papa his wife's name for God. He goes to pray with her, even though its not his thing. She asks many profound questions about God and the next day is drawing the princess. The canoe his other two kids are swimming in tips over and his son is trapped underneath. Mack dives into the lake to save his son as other campers help him pull him to safety. He survives after CPR is administered. However Missy is missing. The police are called to the scene. They tell Mack that there is a man that the FBI has been after for years who abducts young girls, and he may be responsible. The town is put on alert with the FBI and community members gathered in the school gym preparing to search. He is blaming himself but his wife keeps telling him its not his fault. The Feds tell him they found a truck in the woods and they have to go, with Mack going with them. They arrive at a shack and her clothes are there with blood. Flash forward: Mack wakes up on the ice and accuses his best friend Willie (Tim McGraw) of sending the letter. He goes to the post office, but there isn't any information. In his car he thinks about Missy's funeral. He meets with his friend and talks to him more about the note. He asks him if hes prayed about it. He thinks its a bad idea because it could be the killer trying to get him out there. He says maybe its God and insists on going with him. Meanwhile, his wife decides to take their other daughter to see her family she has become withdrawn. His wife is afraid of losing him. He and Willie are all ready to go, the car is packed, with a gun included just in case. He goes to get his stuff and Mack takes the car and leaves without him. On the way he hears the voices of his friends and family and almost gets into an accident with a semi-truck once he hears Missy's voice. He enters the shack, gun in hand, ready to shoot in case the murderer is there. He starts talking to him, as if he was there, yelling about how he didn't even have her body to bury, and then starts running around the shack yelling and slamming things. Again he is ready to shoot when he hears a noise, but it is just a deer. He ventures outside and sees a man. The man is very friendly, even with Mack's gun pointed at him, and invites him inside to warm himself up by the fire and tells him he has someone there that would love to see him. As he walks the snow disappears and suddenly the path and woods are beautiful and it is no longer winter. He approaches the shack and enters what is a large beautiful home. The woman played by Octavia Spencer is there, looking exactly the same as she did when he was a child. She is God (Papa) (The father), the man is her son (Jesus) and a woman named Sarayu is there also, and she is the Holy Spirit. He leaves, thinking he is crazy, but Jesus approaches him telling him he dropped his invitation (the letter from Papa). He goes back inside and Papa tells him how much she loves him. He is surprised as she is a woman she tells him that he couldn't handle a father right now, so she took on that appearance instead. He asks her why she forsake him, and where she has been. Over dinner he tells them that his son is doing well and has a girlfriend, but his daughter not so much. They talk to him about how much they love him and want to get to know him, even though they already do. While he sleeps he has visions of his daughter being kidnapped. In the morning he talks to Papa over breakfast about how she punishes people. However she tells him no, sin is punishment enough, and everything she does works together for good. He accuses her of lying, due to all the pain and suffering in the world. However she tells him the reality is that he doesn't see the whole picture. He doesn't believe she is good but he has to learn to trust her. However he says there is nothing that she could say that would justify Missy's death. He gets up and leaves into the woods, but Sarayu approaches him with directions to his truck and the keys. She tells him they aren't justifying anything, but are there to help heal it. She tells him she needs help in the garden preparing for the next day. She tells him that the poisonous plant, when combined with the right plant, contains healing powers. After a long conversation with her, Jesus tells him he can take the boat out if he wants. His boat starts to sink as he has flashbacks to the day it all began. Jesus keeps telling him not to panic and to look at him as he walks on water. None of it can hurt him as long as he keeps his eyes on him he isnt going anywhere. Suddenly the boat is back in one piece and everything is fine. He tells him they need to go, but Mack insists he will sink. Jesus assures him he wont just trust him. After they get back on land, he tells him to follow the path and will wait for him there. He enters and meets Wisdom(?). They talk about judgment ad she tells him that HE is the one who judges every one based on their clothes, appearance, etc. She tells him he has to judge people and sits him down. He sees visions on the wall of his mother and he getting beat by his father and then sees a vision of his father as a little boy getting beat. Cut to him seeing the visions again of his little girl being taken away. She asks him if God is to blame and he says yes. She says if it is so easy for him to judge God, that he must choose one of his children to go to Heaven and one to Hell, since that's what he believes God does. She gives him reasons why he could pick either one. He tries to leave saying it isn't fair and he cant choose, but she keeps saying he must. He says that he will go to Hell instead of them and take their place. She tells him that's what Papa goes through. There's no such thing as a pain free life, and as long as there is free will evil will be invited in. He sees visions of Missy playing and blowing him a kiss and then running to him. He asks if Missy forgives him for not saving her. She tells him that she never felt that way. Back at the beach he and Jesus run through the water. That evening all three of them take him to the top of a hill. Sarayu covers his eyes and when he opens them he sees people glowing as they see people in color and light. One is walking towards them its his father. He apologizes to Mack and says he was blind and couldn't see anyone. Mack says he was scared and they forgive one another. In the morning Papa comes to him, now as an American Indian man. He brings him to the woods and wants Mack to forgive the killer. He says he wants to hurt him, and he wants God to hurt him also. He tells him that he too is his son, and he wants to redeem him. Mack says he should burn in Hell, but Papa reminds him that he is not the judge. He guides him into forgiveness, and tells him its ok that he is still mad, and it will get easier in time. He is led to her body which he wraps and carries her back to the shack. He asks Jesus to take her as he cant, and they put her in a coffin and bring it to the garden for burial. Beautiful flowers grow above the ground. He is ready to go home, however they tell him that he needs to talk to Kate, as she blames herself for Missy's death. He tells them that he still wants them in his life. Suddenly it is winter again. On his way home he is hit by the truck and winds up in the hospital. Willie is there and tells him that he never made it to the shack and was hit by the semi that night on the way there. His family comes into the room and he tells Nan that he saw Missy and shes beautiful. He talks to Kate and tells her nothing is her fault she feels it was her fault because she stood up on the boat causing it to tip over in the first place. He tells her she doesn't have to go through it alone. His life turns around and they are able to once again have a happy life.",

         "When he was a thirteen year-old boy, Mack killed his abusive and alcoholic father with strychnine in his booze. Years later, Mack Phillips (Sam Worthington) is happily married with Nan (Radha Mitchell) and they have three children: Kate (Megan Charpentier), Josh (Gage Munroe) and the girl Missy Phillips (Amelie Eve). While camping with his family in a weekend, Missy is abducted and killed by the kidnapper, destroying Mack's life. One day, he receives a note from God that he calls Papa (Octavia Spencer) asking him to go to the shack where his daughter was killed. He meets Jesus (Avraham Aviv Alush), Sarayu (Sumire) and Sophia (Alice Braga) and he has an experience of discoveries and redemption. \"The Shack\" is a film for religious and spiritualistic believers only. It is very hard for an atheist of non-religious (or Christian) person to accept the forgiveness that Mack is supposed to give to the killer of his beloved daughter. In addition, the film is politically correct, with God represented by a black woman, Jesus by an Israeli actor and the Holy Spirit by a Japanese actress. Therefore \"The Shack\" can only be recommended for very specific audiences; otherwise will be corny and boring. My vote is five. Title (Brazil): \"A Cabana\" (\"The Shack\")",
         "Oh man, where to start with this one. I went in to the movie not knowing anything about it, aside from that it is about a missing girl and her father who sees her in another world. The first 20 minutes or so were okay to me, interesting, scene- setting, and at times emotional. The family was actually nice to see all together and the initial panic of their missing child felt real. Then things went downhill, and very quickly. Once Mack enters the shack and travels to the other world, I quickly lost interest. Let me start by saying I have no issue with Christianity or any other religion for that matter, so long as it doesn't harm others. That being said, the entire remaining film length felt like one big \"God is great and always loves you\" chore to sit through. Another reviewer here said it felt like a big long advertisement and I couldn't agree more. The excuse of having evil be its own force that god can't interfere with felt lazy, and meant only to reaffirm ones belief that god can do no wrong. Every single lesson the film tried to teach felt WAY too ham-fisted and forced. An example that springs to mind is when Mack is made to judge others. He ends up having to choose one of his two children to send to heaven, while the other is sent to hell. He is made to pick between two people who have done no real wrong and told that one must burn. This is supposed to make the viewer see how difficult it must be for God to judge any of his children (who he loves very much), nevermind how many little girls they murder. The whole God world portion of the film felt like it was just there so people could stroke each other off to the idea that they are loved by God, he heals all, and that we must trust in him that everything happens as it should. Watching this movie made me feel like I was sitting in class on a bright sunny day, wanting to be anywhere except in my seat, but instead of learning anything, I was just preached at for nearly 2 hours. There were a few moments in \"The Shack\" that felt as though they could have been truly moving and emotional, but came across as stale and forced. One particular interaction is between Mack and his father. I was ready to feel real pain at their meeting, but a vast majority of it was squashed in part by poor acting on the father's part, and again, ham fisted shoehorning of the re-occurring themes. As such, the times I felt emotion could have been real tear jerkers, but came across as flat and unconvincing All that being said, the movie was visually quite gorgeous. I loved the whole camping, forest, lake, snow and mountain visuals. They were pleasant and beautiful, but not forced upon the viewer in an overbearing way. The weather was a bit too emphasized in my opinion, but fitting in their themes. There were also some good quotes and humour sprinkled throughout the length of the film. I would strongly advise against watching this film as it's the only one I've ever seen in theaters that made me so badly want to leave. If it wasn't for my girlfriend beside me, and the two elderly ladies blocking us in, I would have been out of there with an hour left on screen. At least it was on half price movie night.",
         "I never thought I will appreciate movie genres like this.Lately I have been watching sci-fi, suspense and romance themed movies. At first I have no plan of watching this movie, but my attention was caught when a friend of mine told me what was this all about. I must say, the movie was \"divinely crafted\". This was the first movie that really punched my ego and played my emotions. Some parts of the movie can rip your soul and enlighten you about the divinity of God, the nature of life, the circumstances that we do not understand. The story was beautifully and intricately written, absolutely. If you watch the movie, you will really feel that God was there, in front of you, talking to you, loving you, giving you ideas that encompass human comprehension. \"Why does it have to happen?, why do we have to suffer?, If God does exist, why wont he show then?\", these are questions common to us, surely you have asked these questions yourself. If you are that person who questions the incomprehensible course of fate, circumstance and life, this movie is for you.",
         "I am not a regular church goer, nor did I have high expectations for this film at all, and I do not cry in films, but this movie made me ball. Most Christian films fall flat and can be subjective, but this was different. I knew people who were fans of the book and highly anticipated the film, but seeing it is not a movie, it is an experience not to be missed. The values of forgiveness and true faith are challenged and as the viewer it was overwhelming. Better than any of the Oscar nominations this year.",
         "Don't hate Christian films, \"Midnight Clear\" was a great film, and because it was a low budget Christian film, Stephen Baldwin's portrayal as Lefty was ignored for any award consideration. But I hate stupid films that refuse to take the path of proper resistance. Case in Point: So you're in a shack w/ God(s), your daughter was murdered by a serial killer THAT'S STILL OUT THERE LOOKING FOR MORE VICTIMS, and not once, not freaking once do you ask God \"Where is he?\" This is where the movie fails. It would have been far more interesting, more challenging, and a better experience if the issue wasn't rehashed 16th century philosophy and instead, whether God would answer that question (Knowing the main character already off'ed his dad in the first 10 minutes of the film, and so was certainly capable of ridding a child killer). Nope, 90 minutes of talking and nothing more. Die hard Christians will eat this up, moderates not so much.",
         "If you are spiritual, but not religious, see this movie. If you are religious, see this movie. If you have suffered a great tragedy or loss, and you are in pain, see this movie. If you have tried to make sense of spirituality and religion but could not, see this movie. It is full of wisdom and metaphor and not your standard religious dogma. It's the best spiritual movie I have yet to see.",
         "If you enjoyed the book--you will love the movie. The movie addresses the ageless philosophical question, \"Why does God let bad things happen?\" It presents some theology in an unorthodox fashion--but not a heretical one. I found it more inspiring than Narnia--which I dearly love. The film follows the book closely, but not 100%. As a film and story it's not perfect--but it's very close. If you have an open mind, I suggest you see it.",
         "This is a wonderful family film. Here's a tip for Hollywood. My friend and I go to a matin√©e pretty much every week. There are sometimes, at most, a dozen, sometimes a half dozen, people in the theater. For this one? The room was a good half full. Now tell me why Hollywood insists on producing nasty, foul, poorly-written and acted pieces of trash all the time? Really. Anyway, this one gives you so much to think about. There are several instances of symbolism in this picture that took my breath away, that brought me to tears. Well written, well-acted, this one is so worth seeing. I am anxious to see it again and trust me, that isn't often the case. I took away from that theater a new feeling and I've thought about several of the lines of dialogue many times since. The truth and the trust of this picture will stay with you. I know it did me. I am always surprised by Tim McGraw. The man can surely sing, but he can also act. He's a natural. Octavia Spencer seems to be in about every movie there is lately - well, not quite but still - however, there is a reason. She is wonderful. She brings her role to life every time. And she most certainly did in this one. Trust me, this is one you want to see. Take your family. Take your friends. Or go alone. Doesn't matter. Just see it.",
         "I loved the book, and therefore was very interested to see the movie production. I thought the movie followed the book as closely as I've ever observed before...while there are differences, the essence of the message, and desire of God to have a personal relationship with each one of us - came through. I thought the casting was well done, and the visual translations of the book's imagery close to how I \"imagined\" it in reading. Thank you for bringing this book to the big screen, and I hope many find hope in Jesus, outside of religion.",
         "I have to admit that I had no idea that Sam Worthington has the acting chops that he proved to have in this movie! I found the movie to be uplifting and inspirational and very earthy in dealing with some dark topics. It walked me through a path of forgiveness and grieving and how to get to the other side using my brain in a way that I don't think I processed before. This really is a very entertaining and fun way to show how to get there in a very compassionate way. It's just a really good movie with a lot of really great messages. I'm going to go see it again. I hope everyone sees it at least once",
         "If you were only allowed to watch one more movie before you die I would recommend The Shack. This allegory about a man's encounter with God is so profound I don't have the words to adequately describe, let alone explain, this intensely unorthodox but beautiful story of redemption and reconciliation. This is a movie for everyone, regardless of spiritual background, journey, or lack thereof. It may also be especially therapeutic for those of us who are experiencing grief over loss, of a loved one, a dream, a job, a relationship. It may also help us understand the heart of God and His redemptive relationship to a broken world, a world He allowed to break, and a world He wants to redeem, one individual at a time. If you are a Christian fundamentalist you might find The Shack's depiction of God unsettling, but as a spiritual allegory of His nature and His interpersonal relationship to or with Himself and those He loves, it is spot-on. And finally, it answers the question as to why evil exists and to why bad things happen to good people and how that is all redeemed in the end. So please, set aside any prejudice you might have against faith-based movies because this one transcends all that and then some with many class-actors, one of whom is an academy award winner, others who's faces you'll recognize from a myriad of other movies they've played and starred in. This is a movie I will easily give 10/10 stars to with great ease, something I rarely do. Finally, this movie has changed me and I want to watch it again several times over and soon, not to mention read the book, which we have but I have ignored. Yeah, it is that good. Sorry for no technical information here, but I will say it was well-produced, filmed, acted, and so on. Not much to dislike here.",
         "For real. 45 minutes in and my lids went droopy. An hour was all I could take. Forget the fact that I am a believer. I didn't enjoy this film not because it didn't frame my belief system appropriately (it did actually), I didn't like this film because it is just plain dumb. I can not accept or rate a film favorably just because it reflects my own beliefs. It actually has to be a well developed story. It isn't. You'll have more fun sitting in a broken lawn chair watching a tire burn in an open field. My first problem was the folksy and assuming narration that takes place in the first 5-10 minutes. It was completely unnecessary and condescending and made me feel as if the director assumed we'd be too dumb to follow the plot. Next was Sam Worthington's character 'Mack'. Worthington has been in some impressive big-budget flicks but he totally bombs here. The emotional range he exhibits barley moves the needle and he speaks virtually all his lines slightly above a gravely whisper. I wanted to slap the guy just to get a reaction out of him. His 'strong silent type' portrayal bit wore me out fast. A close third was the ridiculously clever dialog Mack has with his children and pals before the tragedy of his youngest daughter being taken. Nobody in real life talks like that, especially not children, and I always find it tremendously irritating. This type of script has never once helped me to suspend my dis-belief. Octavia Spencer's portrayal of God or 'Papa' was the final straw. Papa always looks very pleased with herself and bemused by Mack's troubling questions and can only answer back in riddles or questions of her own with a big fat sickening smile. That's when I said 'That's it' and walked out of the nearly abandoned theater (there were only two other customers) and into the early afternoon daylight. Slow as a snail, dull, uneventful, and as I said before, just plain dumb. The only people that are going to rate this film favorably are terrified of making God mad. Yeah, well He's had a load of me over the years and I'm still here. You could never get me to watch this again.",
         "Where to start. I know, how about the end. I was so extremely happy when this ended. Never have I engaged in a flick that made me not just uncomfortable, but aggravated. To the core. There is this little thing called storytelling. I don't care what kind of messages the movie, and I suppose the book, wanted to impart. The art of storytelling matters. This did not get past first base in this most basic function... how to tell a story. It was just one point nailed into your brain after the other. I may as well have just read a scientific journal or the periodic chart or the ingredients of a box of corn flakes and garnered the same bullet points. I cannot even delve further into things like the acting, the production value, the... aw... fugetaboutit. That this failed on the most fundamental level of telling a story, it is senseless to examine anything else deeper. Absolutely dull as... well.. this will now be my new standard to when articulating the definition of empty, dull, gutless... a full expression of a vacuum. To the writers, directors, those who fund things like this... stop. Pick another field. Storytelling is not something you understand, so stop before you try it again. An absolute zero of a film.",
         "The Shack was a triumph. There was not one dull moment to the movie to the shack. If you loved the book then you will love the movie. It is one of those movies where you would wish would never end. This movie has sad moments funny moments and it has a little bit for everyone to enjoy. The shack is a movie that you don't have to be a Christian to enjoy you just have to think the movie looks good have to like the book then go see the movie that everyone will be talking about. It is a brilliant movie and a work of art on the big screen. Parents this is a PG-13 rated movie that has a lot of adult and thematic the AMA, but besides that it is a movie for the whole family will enjoy. This film is one to remember for years and years you will love it",
         "\"The Shack\" is a beautiful, profound, and moving film. I'm a lifelong movie fan and I always look at reviews before I go to see movies. Of course I went to Rotten Tomatoes and saw that \"The Shack\" had received uniformly bad reviews. There is something wrong with the critics who panned this movie. They probably have a problem with Christianity. I think if a similar film had been made in Iran, about Islam, with English subtitles, it would receive an Academy Award nomination. Don't let these bitter, twisted souls keep you from seeing \"The Shack.\" The plot is simple. Mack, (Sam Worthington), an American husband and father, suffers an unbearable loss. He and other family members sink into depression. One day, Mack receives an invitation to return to the shack, the site of the worst moment of Mack's life. He does return, and there he meets spiritual guides played by Octavia Spencer, Aviv Alush, Sumire Matsubara, Graham Greene, and Alice Braga (niece of Sonya Braga). Mack engages in conversation with these spiritual entities. He eventually returns to normal life with a changed outlook. The film gets off to a rocky start. There is an unnecessary and amateurish voice-over narration by country music star Tim McGraw, who stars as Mack's friend. Otherwise, though, McGraw is excellent on screen, displaying an understated charisma and authenticity that are totally beyond the film's actual star, Sam Worthington. In fact I wish Tim McGraw had played Mack and Sam Worthington had played the best friend. Too, there are many shifts in time in the opening scenes. There are flashbacks on top of flashbacks and a shocking crime that the movie never makes much use of. Once the movie gets started, about fifteen minutes in, it gets good. Sam Worthington is okay as Mack. The thing is, his Australian accent is evident in virtually every word he speaks. Again, I wish the filmmakers had made McGraw the star. Radha Mitchell is good looking but chilly as Mack's wife. She looks like a movie star, not like a wife, and that took away from the film for me. The rest of the cast is excellent. Octavia Spencer is assigned to play an almost impossible part, and she handles it with great professionalism and depth. Aviv Alush is especially good. Moviegoers have waited a long time for a star like this to play this part, and he knocks it out of the park. The production values are high. The scenery is lush. I was especially moved by how this family-friendly film handles the tragedy at the center of Mack's depression and alienation from God. The exact words are never used. Graphic images are never shown. Yet we know exactly what happened, and it breaks our hearts and causes us to ask the same questions that Mack asks. Either you want to see a movie where an average man works out how to deal with unbearable tragedy or you don't. Me, I loved sitting there watching Mack wrestle with his pain and his faith. Many self- identified Christians hate this movie with a white hot hatred. Big name Christian leaders have denounced it as heretical. One man told me that seeing the movie would be the equivalent of shooting heroin. It think these folks are wearing their shorts much too tight. The film is an allegory. Any thinking person who has been through pain has had the same questions as Mack, and anyone who has read the Bible or other spiritual literature has pondered the same potential answers. I sincerely doubt that any film-goer is going to leave the theater thinking that he or she has actually seen God on screen, or heard God's thoughts about human tragedy. Rather, like any good allegory, the film sets us on our own path of spiritual exploration. That's a very good thing.",
         "This movie started off relatively well with a feeling of potential. However, the movie quickly turned into a religious preaching session and pumped out clich√© quote after clich√© quote. On a side note, if God is in fact that smug and annoying I'll stay in limbo when the time comes thanks.",
         "The film started well, but something about it was instantly concerning. It was like a re- enactment from a TV crime show, and not actually telling a story, and unfortunately the beginning was the best part. The more you get into the film, you realize why this was the case. They were just setting you up for rant about religion, and how god is all knowing and blameless. It reminded me of all the poor suckers that got conned into a secret engagement with a friend, only to find out they were selling Amway products. That's how it felt, I was duped into thinking I was getting a movie, I wasn't, it was a ridiculous religious fantasy film, but it pretended to be about a father coming to grips with the loss of his kidnapped and murdered daughter. There are too many flashbacks, to the point where you often can't remember when the last bump on the head actually goes back to. Sam Worthington as the father was very one dimensional, very sullen and melancholy throughout the entire film, right up until the very end where he experiences his religious awakening. His accent often changed from American to Australian quite regularly too I might add. The film covers ground from when he was a boy and treated badly by his father, then onto him as a father with his own kids. He takes them on a camping trip, when disaster strikes and one of his kids fall off the canoe and gets trapped underneath. While he is frantically trying to save one son, his daughter is abducted by a felon, apparently well known to local police. There isn't a lot of detail given about the actual specifics of the crime, it is pretty much brushed over. It is merely a tool to alert us as an audience that there are intense levels of sadness, confusion and life questioning situations to come. Time passes, there's some confusing interactions with a neighbour, his own father. One day he borrows the neighbor's 4WD to go back to the 'Shack' where his little girl's clothes were originally located after the abduction. Things go weird here. He gets to the shack, or so we believe, and somehow gets knocked unconscious. But what we see is 'Mack' transported to another world where he meets several people that represent the likeness of god. The dialogue is all about him being angry at god about the loss of his child, but in the film, god never really satisfies the viewer with a shred of a decent answer, just merely shallow propositions you might hear from any experienced politician dodging the real issues. Not to mention the fact that the bible itself makes everyone blameless for almost anything once they ask for god's forgiveness, because god loves all, even the murderers. Mack is s'posed to learn to forgive, and we see Mack learning to forgive for the next hour, literally, it's painful to watch. He is even asked to choose between his own kids, just as god chooses, asking if he should send one to hell, and one to heaven, it makes little sense because his kids had done nothing wrong, unlike his daughters killer. God then questions whether Mack has the right to judge the killer, or maybe the killers father, or that father etc etc, the question being, how far back do you go? God is blameless among all this because it is evil doing this, it isn't god, and god can't choose what is right, and whether or not to intervene. There are no answers in this film, not even in a playfully interesting way, it's a frustrating dialogue to listen to for that long. I'm not really a religious person, I don't mind the odd Christian feel good movie, I liked 'Highway To Heaven', but this was too much and badly done, was not very entertaining, and left me questioning why an actor from a great film like 'Avatar' would consider putting his hand up for this rubbish. Maybe things are real tight in Hollywood at the moment. I could go on about how crap this film was in many other areas, but I think you get the picture. Could do a lot of damage to Worthington's career, its showcased just how bland he can be.",
         "The description of this film promised so very, very much....and then I watched it. Oh dear. I was hoping beyond hope that 'God' in it wasn't going to be the usual politically correct Hollywood clich√©s but there it was...right there....not a white man but a.... have you guessed....yep a black woman straight from the Matrix Oracle school of casting. Like many who have written reviews I couldn't get to the end. We actually managed 42 minutes before my wife said \"Can you turn this crap off please? I can't listen to any more from Whoopi Godberg\". She constantly bleats on in a calming voice and wearing a knowing serene smile about how she was 'there' for the murder and rape of a little girl and that the father shouldn't be angry that she didn't intervene and that he is just looking at it the wrong way. Her love for him is so great, as she keeps repeating ad nausea that apparently she couldn't lift a finger to save an 8 year old girl from being slaughtered in a remote shack in the woods. So much for God's wrath hey? Saves it for defenceless kiddies by the look of this film. Seriously who wrote this drivel? Oh don't forget she will spend a good deal of time in the kitchen complete with the frilly apron baking because apparently that's what an omnipotent being does while children are starving in their mother's arms a short blink away. Doubtless if asked she/it/him/God would say that she was right there with them while their stomachs cramped for want of a slice of that bread she was baking. If ever you had considered delving into Christianity to try to make sense of it then this film will put you off. To all the Christians who regularly talk to their imaginary sky friend I imagine this film left them in turmoil as it brought to the surface the absolute fallacy of a supreme being standing by while his beloved 'children' are slaughtered, raped, starved and murdered throughout history. It did not answer a single question- rather it reinforced what atheists and humanists have been saying for centuries that it is all nonsense and bunkum. Just like this film. Maybe they could now bring out a film questioning why their god character didn't send a Moses to 1943 Germany to save 4 million of his faithful from the Germans in the death camps the same way he did to break them free from their slave master Egyptians. Probably elsewhere moving in mysterious ways in 1943 huh?",
         "This is the first film I have ever watched that has left me feeling angry. The reason I was angry was because I couldn't work out why I disliked it so much. The film was visually quite appealing the acting wasn't awful, the dialog wasn't the worst. The direction was not too bad. The reason came to me after thinking about the film for a while. It tries to manipulates you in a similar way that church ministers would try to manipulate children at school assembley (British thing). The ministers would come to school and preach to children making arguments which made little or no sense, mix in some truth into the nonsense to try to make his point. In a nutshell that is this film, a huge amount of muddled nonsense mixed in with a tiny bit of something that makes sense, and concludes with a predetermined answer which makes it feel like the story has been written backwards so the argument fits the answer. Terrible film.",
         "My wife, friends, and I loved the movie. It was a touching, warm, beautiful tale of life and its beauties and tragedies, of love and hate, of healing forgiveness and corrupting vindictiveness. Heartwarming with a beautiful lesson for any human being. Thanks to the directors and the screen play writers for a great job bringing this to life, and to a wonderful crew of actors for their skillful presentation. Spoiler: Mac learns to forgive God for the evils of life, while living, seeing, and experiencing the gamut of these emotions in His/Her/Their presence.",
         "A perfect 10/10. I was thinking how am I going to sell this movie so everyone I know watches it? I don't need to sell it, is the conclusion I came to. I'm going to share a text I sent to some amazing friends who I watched this with! \"I love papa! I love talking with Him! I love how he uses things we experience to inspire us! I love how he changes our hearts first and then the grace and power flow. I love how he gets excited when we are excited! And I love how happy he is right now. That the little victories are big victories in the kingdom of God. I just want to share this with everyone lol!\" So I will. I love the best friend I have in Jesus. That I can talk to him about anything and he cares. I love what he did for me. I love the Holy Spirit. I love the warmth he brings, the comfort, kindness and power that comes and flows through me. And I love how they are all God. My advice to others is set aside what you think you know for an open mind and a new experience. The Holy Spirit is the spirit of truth, let her do the thinking and you do the watching and feeling. Just so you know my biases have been set aside for this movie review. I don't like a lick of country music! And Tim McGraw is in this movie! The king of country! The message is so powerful I ignored all my biases and just experienced an amazing movie!",
         "The best part of this movie was that it led me to this fantastic review by hungba-43166. Author: hungba-43166 from Hong Kong 25 May 2017 \"This is my first ever review on IMDb. Usually, when I watch a terrible movie, I just forget about it and let it slide. THIS piece of crap, however, made me so angry that I feel it is my duty to warn others to not watch this highly immoral load of garbage. The movie is basically a big PR work for Christianity, saying \"god is good, trust god\", while every bit if reasoning trying to explain why is utter nonsensical horsecrap. \"Yes god let an innocent little girl get raped and killed but he is good because he loves you and is with you always. No, really! See? I'm crying! So it must be true. \" I am intelligent enough to not let this filth be my basis of judging Christians, but I can see how some may watch this and want to go out and hurt religious people if they thought this was widely representative if their beliefs. Please don't, be a good person, unlike the makers of this rubbish film. Basically, if you take this film seriously, it will confirm to you that god is full of crap and if you ever see him/her whatever you should kick the crap out of him/her to teach god a much needed lesson. I have made a note of the actors, writers and directors involved in the making of this absolute garbage and will try my best to never watch another film they are involved in. I suggest you do the same. If there is indeed a way to determine if one should go to heaven or hell, that judgement should be based on whether they enjoyed this film or not. If they liked it, they should burn in hell. I guess I am going to heaven after all.\"",

         "Another Christian propaganda movie! The first 20 mins looks promising till the main actor goes back to the shacks and it went down hill from there. You will sit thru 2 hours of Christian advert force down your throat. It's crappy acting and the movie tries to push all the emotion button wrong. A complete waste of time.",
         "While on a camping trip with his 3 children, Mack (Worthington) is forced into a situation where he has to save his son. During that act his youngest daughter, Missy, is abducted and murdered. The remainder of the movie deals with how he deals with it and eventually moves on from it. This could be the setup for any regular drama, but it IS a faith based film. The movie very much deals with God, from a purely Christian perspective, and issues of faith. While I may not personally agree with the resolutions provided by the movie, there are things worth commending about it. The movie has much better production, writing, and most importantly, acting than any other faith based movie. The issues which are dealt with are real issues, and are treated as real human beings would. Too often faith based movies present a problem, and then just say pray and everything will be good. The Shack does actually delve into the mindset of loss, anger, and grief, and while not all may be satisfied with how it suggests handling it, at least it is handled maturely. To quickly touch on the Christianity of the movie: There is no getting around it. Mack meets three people who are God, Jesus and the Holy Spirit. It's very plain. Even so, if you can ignore the who, and listen to the what the movie can be watched by a person of any faith. I wouldn't recommend it to somebody looking for a thriller, as it's certainly not that. But for somebody who just wants to think about their faith a little, Christian or not, it provides that."
