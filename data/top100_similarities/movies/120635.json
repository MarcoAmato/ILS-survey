            "content": "> Independently a fine movie rather being associated with TAKEN.\r\n\r\nActually, it was not a bad movie, I really enjoyed it. But associated with 'Taken' and being the third film in the series was the setback. Because unlike the first two films, this one was somewhat detached from the original theme. Except the cast from the previous two, the story takes place in a completely different platform. From all the three films, the phone call between father and daughter was retained, but was not effective as the first one which became just a trademark of the series, that's all.\r\n\r\nThe first half creates the puzzle and next half solves it. As expected, it was a typical structure in this trilogy, but the last quarter was turned into something like 'Mission Impossible'. In 'Taken' films, Bryan Mills (our lead guy) works alone, but he formed a team with a tech guy and others. That does not sound good, at least tried to be different from the original movie.\r\n\r\nIt is a little disappointment for 'Taken' fans, but you will have a best shot if you see it as an independent one off movie. Yes could have made a better action flick if it was not linked to it. Hope it all ends here like they have said. As a trilogy, it failed, or maybe we can call it a 50-50. But the first one was a masterpiece, a trendsetting piece.\r\n\r\n6.5/10",

            "content": "The rugged and feisty Liam Neeson (as on-screen alter ego ex-CIA operative Bryan Mills) is back in fighting form for a third and supposedly final go-around in \u2018Taken 3\u2032. This tired and tepid action-packed crime thriller is directed by French filmmaker Olivier Megaton (\u2018Taken 2\u2019, \u2018Transporter 3\u2019) with screenwriting credits attributed to \u2018Taken\u2019 producer Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen. Clearly Neeson and company want to squeeze the remaining strained juices out of the \u2018Taken\u2019 film franchise as this movie series trilogy ends on an exhausting whimper. Uninspired, toothless and motoring on empty impishness, \u2018Taken 3\u2032 has run its kinetic course for the aging Neeson to aim, shoot and take down some serious repetitive butt-kicking numbers.\r\n\r\nAfter the last two energizing installments where flashy foreign locales were a major part of the appealing \u2018Taken\u2019 universe, \u2018Taken 3\u2032 is reduced to unraveling in the uneventful backyard of familiar Los Angeles that definitely lacks the exotic excitement and visual vitality that were previously showcased in posh landscapes such as Paris and Istanbul. In fact, star Neeson reportedly nixed the idea to partake in the \u2018Taken 3\u2032 production if there was another concept of kidnapping involved. Huh? Why avoid the element of kidnapping when in fact it was the soundly running gimmick that made the \u2018Taken\u2019 experience palpable and pulsating? Still, this is the least of \u2018Taken 3\u2019s bothersome problems as the movie delves in the manufactured mockery involving cliched car chases, sketchy gunplay and the inclusion of countless Russian mobsters parading about in obligatory fashion. Importantly, even Neeson seems quite disengaged as his robotic Bryan Mills goes through the motions trying to find some upside in the forced upbeat shenanigans that seem to trudge along scene after scene.\r\n\r\nThe very first outing in \u2018Taken\u2019 took audiences by surprised as it featured a matured Neeson as an avenging former CIA human weapon Mills committed to his fatherly duties in manhandling the Albanian human traffickers that dared to abscond his teen daughter Kim (Maggie Grace). In \u2018Taken 2\u2032, the hostile adversaries want Mills\u2019s head on a platter after he tore up their territory in his crusade to rescue his precious offspring from the opportunistic ruffians. Now Mills finds his neck on the line in the connection with his ex-wife Lenore\u2019s (Famke Janssen) brutal murder. Look out LA\u2026the harried Bryan Mills is out in survival mode. The question remains: whose blood will be spilled in the process?\r\n\r\nPrior to Lenore\u2019s senseless demise, she had visited her ex-hubby Bryan and the feelings between the former spouses are still strong. Mills still carries an emotional torch for Lenore but he cannot act upon his affections for her. Poor Lenore is trapped in her current unhappy marriage with an insufferable moneybags misfit Stuart St. John (Dougray Scott). In the aftermath of Lenore\u2019s death, the distraught and beleaguered Mills finds out the trouble that he is embroiled in so convincingly. As a result of his former lover\u2019s slaughtering Bryan Mills is reeling with outrage. Yes, folks, it appears that Mills is on the run and must prove his innocence and bring to the forefront the murderers that butchered Lenore. Mills has on his mind the need to protect his exposed college-aged daughter Kim from potential harm as well.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, the LAPD lead investigator in Franck Doltzer (Oscar winner Forest Whitaker, \u2018The King Of Scotland\u2019) must track down the defiant Mills and make some sense out of the Lenore Mills St. John slaying.  Mills proves to be elusive and crafty as usual while leaving behind his trademark trashing of battered bodies and bouncing bullets in the chaotic southern California streets.\r\n\r\nSeemingly, the catchy novelty act of a hulking middle-aged Neeson exploding at the seams in action-oriented fashion resonated with glorious forethought. After all, \u2018Taken\u2019 single-handily resurrected Neeson\u2019s box office cred and made him a cinematic hipster to the young folks and his aged contemporaries alike.  However, the third time is not the charm in revisiting the gun-toting \u2018grandpa\u2019. Sadly, \u2018Taken 3\u2032 is mindlessly played out as Neeson\u2019s Mills or the handlers behind this hollow hedonistic actioner have dipped their toes in an empty well of ideas to conclude this three-part crime caper.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s face facts\u2026we all were \u2018Taken\u2019 in by this pseudo punchy action yarn that no longer generates the destructive heat it once punctuated with carefree confidence.\r\n\r\nTaken 3 (2015)\r\n\r\n29th Century Fox\r\n\r\n1 hr.  49 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Liam Neeson, Forest Whitaker, Famke Jannssen, Maggie Grace and Dougray Scott\r\n\r\nDirected by: Olivier Megaton\r\n\r\nRated: PG-13\r\n\r\nGenre: Action and Adventure/Crime thriller/Mystery and Suspense\r\n\r\nCritic\u2019s rating: ** stars (out of four stars)",

      "synopsis": "A couple of Russian thugs come into a man's home and quietly take him away from his wife. The man is brought before a Russian mob boss, Oleg Malankov (Sam Spruell), who demands that the man opens the safe in the room they're standing in. The safe is opened, but it's empty. Malankov calls his employer and tells him there is nothing in the safe, but he will leave him something else. Malankov shoots the man dead. Meanwhile, Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) buys a giant panda bear for his daughter Kim's (Maggie Grace) birthday. At home, Kim holds up a pregnancy test and looks at it worriedly. Bryan shows up with the panda, followed moments later by Kim's boyfriend Jamie (Jonny Weston). Kim comments that Bryan is predictable, while Jamie says Kim is as well, since she follows the same routine and goes to the convenience store to get the exact same orange smoothie drink from the exact same position. Bryan departs and takes the panda with him, even though Kim admits to feeling a bit bad about not wanting it. After he leaves, Bryan talks to his ex-wife Lenore (Famke Janssen) on the phone about Kim. He invites her over to dinner but she declines. Lennie surprises Bryan by showing up at his place while he's making dinner. She tells him that she's not very happy at home with her husband Stuart (Dougray Scott). She makes a pass at Bryan by kissing him. However, he knows this would be inappropriate and he politely turns down Lennie's advances. During a game of golf with his friends, Bryan gets a call from Kim and she invites him to meet with her at a diner. She prepares to tell him about her pregnancy when they see a bratty child making a fuss at another table. Kim gets nervous and tells Bryan she wants his advice on whether or not she should get a puppy. Bryan is visited by Stuart, who thinks that in order for his marriage with Lennie to work, Bryan needs to be out of the picture and that he should stop seeing her socially. Bryan assures Stuart that they're only friends and that there is nothing going on between them. Bryan gets a text from Lennie asking him to meet her at his apartment for some bagels. Bryan gets the bagels and returns to find a knife on the floor. He goes in the bedroom and sees Lenore lying dead on the bed with her throat slashes. As Bryan recoils in horror, two policemen burst in with guns pointed at Bryan. They prepare to handcuff him when Bryan ends up cuffing both of them. He jumps out the window as he hears more cops coming. They chase him through the streets until he runs into a garage and escapes through a hatch door into the river and out to the basin. Bryan calls Kim from a payphone while she is at Lennie's home looking for a sweater. He breaks the news to Kim about her mother's murder and that he is now being framed. He tells her to stay safe and that he will protect her. Kim steps back in shock and sits down to cry. Hot on Bryan's trail is Inspector Franck Dotzler (Forest Whitaker). He and his men investigate the crime scene and also visit Stuart and Lennie's home. Stuart returns immediately from a business trip. He is brought in to identify Lennie's body at the morgue. He breaks down and tells Dotzler about Bryan's past. Bryan sneaks into the morgue and finds Lennie's body. He solemnly touches her face and collects a hair sample. The cops inspect the parking garage where Lennie left her car. Bryan gets a scan on the car's GPS and sees that Lennie went to the gas station prior to her death. He goes to the gas station and sneaks into the security room to play a video. He sees footage of Lennie being snatched by a masked man and thrown into a van. One of the men has a star-like tattoo on his hand. Two detectives stop at the same gas station and learn that Bryan was there. They find him in the security room and arrest him. Bryan goes in calmly. The detectives inform Dotzler of their arrest of Bryan, but, since Dotzler has just followed up on Bryan's past, he knows that Bryan is setting them up. In the backseat of the police cruiser, Bryan carefully uncuffs himself and knocks out one cop while forcing the other to keep driving. The detectives chase Bryan as he takes control of the cruiser. This leads them through a garage where the cruiser ends up falling down an elevator shaft. The car explodes, but Bryan escapes. Dotzler talks to Bryan on the phone and tells him to stand down since everyone is going to be looking for him. Bryan responds, \"Good luck.\" Bryan visits his friend Sam (Leland Orser), to whom he gave the sample to and also informs him of what happened to Lenore. Sam stands by Bryan and is willing to help him. He tells Sam he wants to go to the funeral. Lenore's funeral takes place, with everyone going to console Kim and Stuart. Sam goes over to Kim and tells her to follow her \"predictable schedule.\" He motions to the button on his lapel, which is a hidden camera. Kim knows her dad is watching and she smiles. Kim leaves Stuart's home when she sees that he kept too many guards around. One detective follows Kim as she goes to the convenience store to get her smoothie drink. She finds the one she wants and finds a note on it that says \"Drink me now\". She drinks it all in one standing. She then goes to school and feels nauseous during class. She goes to the bathroom and is pulled into a stall by Bryan. They embrace and he gives her a serum to counter what he put in the drink to make her nauseous. Kim comes clean about the pregnancy. With little time, Bryan tells Kim he'll find the real culprits right before the detectives burst in. Bryan is already gone by then. While driving away, Bryan is pursued by some Russian thugs. They run him off the road, causing his car to explode. One goon comments on going to get drunk. Bryan gets a man to let him drive his car to follow the goons to the liquor store. Bryan beats the thugs all around the store until they are all knocked out, save for one last man - the man with the tattoo on his hand. Bryan takes him down and orders him to tell him who sent him. The man says he would rather die than tell, so he grabs Bryan's gun, puts it in his mouth, and pulls the trigger. Bryan locates Stuart, who retreated to a beach house. He knows Stuart sent the thugs, and Bryan takes Stuart to another area and waterboards him for information. Stuart was involved in a bad business deal with Oleg Malankov, and Lennie unfortunately became a victim of his when Stuart failed to return the man his money. He was merely counting on Bryan to find out about the situation and to utilize his killing skills to make the problem disappear. Stuart also tells Bryan that Malankov is a trained killer that joined the army and Special Forces, and that he is just as good at killing as Bryan. Together, with Kim, Sam, and other friends of Bryan's, they have Stuart set up a meeting with Malankov. Malankov arranges for them to meet at a building downtown. Bryan gets his opening to run through the building, beating up and killing all of Malankov's goons before finding the man himself in his apartment. The two fight each other, with Malankov nearly shooting Bryan, until Bryan takes the gun from him and shoots him twice. Bryan approaches Malankov to deliver the final shot, until Malankov says they were played by the same man - Stuart. Bryan leaves Malankov to die slowly. In Sam's van, Kim sees some texts from Lenore's phone that mention going to a specific location. She texts Bryan and then tries to contact him on his earpiece. Stuart knows what's happening, so he grabs Kim and shoots Sam in the neck. Stuart flees with Kim. The cops find the van with Sam unconscious but alive. Bryan realizes Kim is in trouble and he hijacks a car to go after her and Stuart. He tracks her location and sees she's headed for the airport. The cops track Bryan and follow him. At the airport, Stuart gets his private plane ready to take off with him and Kim. The pilots begin to steer the plane off the tarmac when Bryan drives over quickly and plows through the wheels, taking the plane down. Stuart emerges from the plane with Kim at gunpoint. She manages to escape him, leaving him to Bryan. Bryan puts together just how Stuart tried to get away with Lenore's murder while beating the man senseless. Before Bryan can kill Stuart, they hear the police sirens getting closer. Stuart says Bryan can't kill him now, and when Bryan tries to prove him wrong, he looks over to Kim, who shakes her head and urges him not to. Bryan figures that Stuart will probably get a good lawyer and be out of jail in a few years, and that's when Bryan will get him. He knocks Stuart out and leaves him to get arrested. Bryan meets with Dotzler in his office. Dotzler says he knew Bryan was innocent because he found the bagels in his apartment, and they were still warm. By that logic, he couldn't have bought bagels and then committed murder. They part ways, and Dotlzer closes Bryan's files. Bryan joins Kim and Jamie on the pier. He supports the two of them as they expect their child. Kim says that if it's a girl, they will name her after Lenore. Bryan agrees with that choice.",

         "To set the record straight, no one gets taken in 'Taken 3', a condition that its principal star Liam Neeson laid down before he agreed to return for this third and presumably final instalment. That is perfectly fine with us; after all, how many times can ex- Special Forces operative Bryan Mills find himself having to deploy his very particular set of skills after a member of his family is taken away from him? Indeed, that is not the issue we had with this utterly disappointing third outing, which totally squanders what audience goodwill the first movie had accumulated and its immediate predecessor had not yet depleted. Produced by French-based EuropaCorp, the Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen-scripted 'Taken' was one of the most notable action films in recent memory when it was released back in 2008. Key to its success was Neeson, whose viciously efficient qualities as the former CIA badass were excellent complement to the actor's natural gravitas and air of gentleman nobility. The inevitable sequel that followed four years later was a letdown to say the least; not only did it slavishly repeat the original's formula, it toned down the former's no-holds-barred brutality to make it more accessible to a younger audience, and in the process losing the former's gritty, visceral, and even transgressive edge. Unfortunately, fans of the original hoping that the series would go out on a bang will be sorely disappointed to know that 'Taken 3' is cast in the same mould as the sequel. There are plenty of gunshots but no sight of blood. There is hand-to-hand combat that plays out more like a playground brawl between teenagers. Even a torture scene that sees Neeson waterboard fellow co-star Dougray Scott is extremely tame in comparison with a similar and brutally memorable one in the first movie, that if one recalls involved the use of electric clamps that Neeson stabbed into his nemesis' thighs. Not that we relish the portrayal of extreme violence, but 'Taken 3' seem to know not the difference between being restrained and being dull. But the deadened violence isn't quite the movie's most critical flaw; that belongs unquestionably to its director Olivier Megaton. A Besson regular since 'Transporter 3', Megaton took over the reins from Pierre Morel on 'Taken 2' but has apparently learnt nothing from his previous directorial duties. If there was already a worrying ineptness to his ability to craft a proper action sequence in 'Taken 2', then this follow-up shows Megaton at his most incompetent. Clearly influenced by Paul Greengrass' frenetic shooting of the 'Bourne' movies, Megaton insists on flailing hand-held camera-work, frantic over-editing and claustrophobic close-ups to ruin every single action sequence in the entire f**king movie (and yes, it is indeed that frustrating to watch). A freeway car chase is reduced to a flurry of close-ups and rapid edits that bear no continuity or coherence. A confrontation in a liquor store between Neeson and some of the Russian mobsters who took his ex-wife's life is shot in such close-ups it is impossible to make out who is doing what. And worst of all, there is no climax to speak of � not when a shootout between Neeson and another group of Russian mobsters protecting their boss Oleg Malankov (Sam Spruell) is so poorly staged it makes not a single iota of sense, or when a race between a Porsche driven by Neeson and a private plane ends in an collision that takes out the plane's front wheel but leaves no one hurt. It is even more infuriating to think that Megaton manages to f**k up every single sequence when there aren't that many to begin with. Eschewing the simple set-up of the previous two films, Besson and Kamen have instead opted here for a more plot-driven narrative, setting Neeson up against Forest Whitaker's LAPD Detective Franck Dotzler even while the former hunts down his wife's killers. That certainly recalls the dynamic between Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones in 'The Fugitive', but 'Taken 3' is nowhere as smart and Whitaker nowhere near as keen as Jones' ever was. Though Besson and Kamen's script opts for double-crosses, hidden agendas and whodunits to keep their audience's attention, it is quite clear right at the very start just who has been pulling the strings, a mystery that once solved makes the rest of the proceedings unnecessarily protracted. Not that it actually matters � while Neeson went about methodically tracking down his kidnapped family in the first and second movies, he rarely exhibits the same kind of discipline clearing his name here. Too much time is spent on emotionally hollow character relationships in the first act, i.e. between Bryan and his young adult daughter Kim (Maggie Grace), or between Bryan and his ex-wife Lenore (Famke Janssen), or between Bryan and Lenore's current husband Stuart (Scott), while the second act is equally wasted on Bryan's strenuous efforts to contact Kim who is placed under the close watch of the LAPD. By the time Bryan actually gets down to investigating, almost everyone involved looks more keen on getting it over and done � none more so than Neeson, who looks tired and completely uninterested from scene to scene. Perhaps Neeson is all too aware that the 'Taken' franchise has completely sputtered out; indeed, 'Taken 3' plays almost like a parody of the original movie, which was to action fans a sheer unbridled delight for its realistic stuntwork and hand-to-hand combat. Both these elements are sorely and sadly missing from a movie that can't even get its priorities right, no thanks to the utter shocking ineptitude of its director. Like we said, no one in the movie gets taken, but little did we know that the title was meant to be a joke on its audience, who are literally taken for a ride here. Spare yourself the agony, frustration and disappointment, and just NOT get on in the first place.",
         "3 stars might be a little harsh seeing as I did enjoy this film, but I enjoyed it for all the wrong reasons. Seemed like a movie made by idiots for idiots. Anyone who is mildly intelligent will find it laughable. Where do I start, the way this film was shot was poor at best, no scene lasted longer the 3 minutes to try and achieve the same relentless pace we enjoyed from the first Taken movie. This was even worse during any action sequence where there would be about 20 different shots in a space of 30 seconds showing pretty much the same event from pointless angles. The dialogue, so cheesy, they put in every cliché line from any action movie you can think of, one dimensional characters sounding like idiots. There was a moment in this film where Mills plugs in a USB into a LAPD computer and the computers voices says \"You are currently accessing the LAPD hidden files\" just in case people in the cinema missed this. This movie treats its audience like they are slow, and I feel you actually have to be to enjoy it for what it is. Some of the actions sequences were so unrealistic even a 9 your boy would find it a push to believe let alone us adults. Poor way to end a dying trilogy. Hopefully it will now stay dead.",
         "You'd have to be an idiot to trust the opinion of someone who can't review a movie without waffling for 20 minutes. Listen to me; you won't be sorry. This is not a good movie. Taken was pretty good; Taken 2...not so much. This one is just bad; It's just an old guy running around, shooting at stuff. None of the clever stuff from the other 2 movies is here. Nothing that made Taken good is in here. Nothing that made Taken 2 at least recognizable as a Taken movie is here. If you ignore me and watch it anyway, I will look for you, I will find you...you know the rest. Actually, if you'd sat through this movie, you'd probably welcome the sweet relief. I meant to end this review right after \"This movie is bad\", but IMDb apparently likes people to waffle, and there is a 10 line minimum.",
         "Whoever edited and filmed this, should visit a doctor ASAP. The editing is atrocious, you can't see anything during the action scenes. Moves and hits are usually lost and you can't see who is hitting who, where, how. If you think Taken 2 was bad, this movie takes the spot at clearly trying to do the worst to suck badly. The movie is also slow and it's less focused on action, if compared to the previous ones. By the way, if nobody is taken, then why is it called Taken? Is it because my money was TAKEN by a crappy movie? Bad guys appear in the first 5 minutes and then come back only after the 1 hour mark. That means we got almost 1 hour of pure nonsense. Our hero destroys at least 20 cars, obviously killing innocent people. Nothing happens to him, he's called a hero, he is free to walk away, Such cool guy that Brian Mills!!! This movie is a turd and you should avoid. Ah, it doesn't even have a real conclusion. If Taken 4 gets made ( you know it'll get made ), we know his grandchild is gonna be Taken. I'm serious, he now has a freaking grandchild to take care.",
         "Taken 3 is a step down from Taken 2, itself a lesser film than the original. But that is to be expected and forgiven. The title could be considered an unimaginative misnomer, but it makes marketing sense. Aside from the part of Stuart (husband to Famke Janssen's Lenore), the casting is consistent. The addition of Forest Whitaker as a smart cop is for me something of a saving grace since Taken 3 offers up absurdities without question. On reflection, however, the plot has enough coherence to do the trilogy justice. Moreover, it is a joy to see Liam Neeson in this role again. The director Olivier Megaton has an irksome penchant for frenetic, up-close, disorienting action sequences whereby shots are rarely longer than two seconds. He was a little better in this regard for Taken 2, which had the benefit of superior choreography. Another personal point of contention is the casting of Sam Spruell as the top Russian villain. He has not an imposing physical constitution and quite frankly brings to mind Jim Carrey, who sported the same haircut in the Dumb and Dumber movies. Not at all what I want in a villain. I generally enjoy the films I see, and this one�notwithstanding the negatives�is no exception. However, I would not recommend it for people who are more stern in matters of taste.",
         "One of the worst movie editing I've ever seen in my life for an action movie. That killed the movie for me. I think they should just withdraw Taken 2 and Taken 3 and admit that they should have stopped at the first one. This movie was so boring, and when you expected to see some action scenes, you were getting yourself in the paranoid mind of a director who wanted to experiment on the poor audience. My eyes still hurt from the crappy editing of this movie. Guys please stop here, enough, no more Taken sequels. With each one of them you're killing the hype that the first one created.",
         "In Los Angeles, Lenore St. John (Famke Janssen) is murdered with sliced throat in the apartment of her ex-husband Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) and he is accused by the police of murdering her. Detective Franck Dotzler (Forest Whitaker) pursues Bryan while he investigate who might be the killer and protects his daughter Kim (Maggie Grace). Bryan discovers that the Russian gangster Oleg Malankov (Sam Spruell) is the responsible of Lenore's death and together with his team of friends and Lenore's husband Stuart St. John (Dougray Scott), he hunts him down. But why Lenore was killed? \"Taken 3\" is a movie with awful camera, edition and direction and senseless plot. The edition is annoying with several cuts, but the plot is ridiculous. When Bryan is arrested at the gas station, no police officer is interested to see the surveillance camera footage. Why should he drug his daughter instead of putting a note in the yogurt scheduling a meeting with her in the toilet? How did he escape from the explosion in the elevator? Oleg's building is surrounded by security system, but a van parks in the parking area and no guard comes to check. Stuart spends lots of time in the van and it is not strange for the security guards. Why Stuart need to flee abducting Kim? Did Bryan's friend die in the van? Bryan causes several accidents on the highway certainly with injured people; destroys a parking building and cars; destroys an airplane; but in the end everything is OK. My vote is four. Title (Brazil): \"Perseguição Implacável 3\" (\"Implacable Search 3\")",
         "Wow...after reading some of the reviews, anyone would think they were reviewing an Academy Award nominated film. Whatever happened to watching a movie for fun and escapism and having a good time, because this film is certainly all that. I took my 15 yr old daughter along as well and she loved it, as did I. Yes nobody was taken but who gives a toss. What else would you suggest the movie be called that is part of the same franchise and has the same character? Seriously some of these reviewers need to get the plum out of their mouth and stick with watching other types of movies more suited to writing 25 paragraphs of hate. They clearly have no interest in the action genre. Go and see it and enjoy it for what it is...a great action movie with a pretty good story and don't go with the idea that it's going to win any Academy Awards.",
         "Oh, sure, there are a ton of sequels that both \"take\" down a series, but also \"take\" it too far. Taken 3 is the A Good Day to Die Hard of the series and by God, I hope both movies end the two franchises. I recently gave Taken 2 another chance after not liking it the first time it was released. Wow. If anyone thought that movie was bad, just watch the third chapter I initially was hoping would be the Last Crusade of the series. False. And I actually like Taken 2 the second time a whole lot more than the first viewing. This absolutely atrocious sequel that has nothing to do with the series, let alone anything to do with \"TAKING,\" is basically a sometimes action script that was altered to piggyback on the successful series. Yes. Just like Troll 2 and just about as bad. After an incredibly stale opening that, again, feels nothing like a \"Taken\" movie, it continues with basically, the same dumb opening of Alien 3. What follows is an amazingly predictable movie where a wrongfully accused 62-year-old actor acts like someone as athletic as someone a third of his age and can escape explosions as easily as Batman dodging a nuclear explosion in under 5 seconds. It's no wonder Liam Neeson starred in The A-Team movie � he never has a scratch on him after unbelievably surviving multiple car wrecks that would easily kill 999 out of 1,000 people. What this movie should've done was to fire Liam, hire Jason Statham, rename this as Transporter 4 and acknowledge the silliness like that series did. The decision is clear: Watch 2008's Taken and repeatedly. No need to see #2 or #3. Dear God, please let there be no fourth Taken. I can't possibly \"take\" this anymore. * * * Final thoughts: Lesson learned � to clear your name from a crime you didn't commit, kill as many people in cold blood while leaving more than enough evidence behind � not to mention, admitting to the police that you murdered someone � and then you can live happily ever after. For shits and giggles, run a car into a plane taking off that's holding the very person you're trying to protect. Don't worry, it'll survive the explosion, as, um, most planes do.",
         "Retired special ops chap Bryan Mills seems to attract the sort of trouble which his special set of skills is ideally placed to deal with. And so here we go again.... If you take this on its own merits, it is a tolerable action thriller, albeit peppered with annoyances � thick-headed police, action sequences filmed with extreme close-ups edited extremely badly, ex-wife's current husband recast from Xander Berkeley (first film) to Dougray Scott here (which is tantamount to painting \"villain\" on his forehead), and � like episode 2 � an absence of the grim mercilessness in Liam Neeson's Bryan Mills, which was the thing which made the original so riveting. So if you loved the first one and were unimpressed by the second one, best not bother with this one. Oh, and it all takes place in LA � not very European at all."
