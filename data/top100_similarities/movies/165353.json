            "content": "**In the old west, it's always about the revenge!**\r\n\r\nBelieve it or not, this is the western version of 'John Wick'. Same storyline except it takes place in the desert of the old west. A man who had enough killing native Americans, is now abandoned everything and heading towards Mexico for a fresh start. But on a way in a small town, he gets into a trouble. After surviving the assault, he goes back to hunt them all and like most of the western film, the end is predictable.\r\n\r\nThis is not a bad flick, but it was not fresh enough, either its story or the gun fights. With a bunch of decent actors, a decently made film. The characters were limited, the atmosphere was like deserted. So the overall narration was focused on a few characters in its entire 100 minute run. I felt sorry for Travolta, they did not get anything out of him, he just had a presence and nothing else. In other hand Ethan was okay, but his role was designed as an average man in the old west, not a powerful one as we expect in this type of film.\r\n\r\nThe title says it all, but it was not that ruthless as compared to the most of the similar western films I have seen. Mostly it will bring a disappointment for its viewers, but definitely a few would enjoy it for its simpleness. For me, it was an average, but thought it could have been better, particularly in the gun battle. So it's nothing more than just once watchable with a low expectation.\r\n\r\n_6/10_",

            "content": "The Denton Rapscallion.\r\n\r\nIn a Valley of Violence is written and directed by Ti West. It stars Ethan Hawke, Taissa Farmiga, James Ransome, Karen Gillan and John Travolta. Music is by Jeff Grace and cinematography by Eric Robbins.\r\n\r\nEthan Hawke plays Paul, an ex soldier accompanied only by his dog, Abbie, who is drifting across the desert towards Mexico. Stopping off in the dying town of Denton, Paul finds trouble that will have consequences for himself and town alike.\r\n\r\nTi West is more well known for his horror ventures, where although divisive in that genre sphere, he can be proud of his success rate. Here he tackles the Western, and true to form, he homages past genre masters whilst unmistakably putting his own stamp on things. Opening with credits straight out of Spaghetti Western land, and introducing us to a musical score that will accompany the story that is wonderfully feverish, West is in no hurry for blood and bone shenanigans. He always favours the slow burn and so it proves here.\r\n\r\nThere's nothing remotely new here, it's a standard tale of a gunman - one damaged by his war efforts - who through circumstance is forced to abandon his hope of a quiet life. He's a loner man of few words, thus giving viewers a classic Western character staple, an anti-hero to root for and for us to yearn for him to find peace. When the violence comes, it's sharp and bloody, but often there is humour as well, deftly inserted into proceedings, whilst the canine is skillful and a key character to all and sundry.\r\n\r\nPerfs are more than adequate. Hawke sifts seamlessly into being a believable drifter type of complexity, Ransome is annoyingly brattish, but that's actually job well done, and Travolta - sporting a wooden leg - gets better once (and if) you buy into him in this setting. Gillan isn't given much to do, but lands some decent emotive punches, but it's Farmiga who stands out as Mary-Anne. She's utterly infectious and thankfully she gets a well written part, that of a young woman trying to hold her own in the most trying of township circumstance.\r\n\r\nThe purpose built town of Denton looks just that!, but this is off- set a touch by the nice location landscapes (Santa Fe, New Mexico), and with the story working from solid genre foundations then this is a pleasure - without pulling up any trees - for fans of such. 7/10",

         "If you are a fan of classic Westerns, you'll find yourself glued to the screen enjoying every minute of this film. Disclosure: I am 62 years old as I write this, so I've seen 'em all. And watching this one, I couldn't help feel like it was 1967, or thereabouts, what with the steady camera-work, the superb cinematography capturing all the dusty glory of New Mexico, U.S.A. And the soundtrack! Not some canned muzak, not some minimalist guitar scratchings, but a full-blown beauty of a musical composition that took me right back to the Spaghetti classics. Now, this won't win an Oscar, but dang if it didn't make my Friday night popcorn and beer movie night. \"In A Valley of Violence\" is a total winner. p.s....the dog is an unbelievably good actor.",
         "In a Valley of Violence follows a travelling cowboy who, after stopping by a small town, unintentionally starts conflict among the more powerful members there. Let's start with the obvious part: Ethan Hawke. He's fantastic, as per usual. I don't think I've ever not been impressed by this guy, and that trend continues here. John Travolta pulls off a solid performance as well, playing one of the most interesting characters in the movie. And James Ransone does the same, pulling off a good ol' western hothead. Personally I don't think that Taissa Farmiga was very fit for this role, but she did her best and thankfully fails to take anything of significance away from the movie. The writing is good as well. The movie builds the characters and conflict for a while before anything of real significance happens, and it makes it all the more effective. It excels at building tension, making the last 40 minutes of this movie just that much better. Speaking of the last 40 minutes, they're awesome. After an hour of solid build up, we are treated with some great western action. It's tense and exciting, yet not over-the-top. It's just right. Overall I really enjoyed In a Valley of Violence. The acting, writing, and action are all great, and in the end I would definitely recommend it.",
         "(The title of this review in honor of the 1995 Sam Raimi flick \"The Quick and the Dead,\" yet another director who decided to take the Italian Western genre out for a spin, wind her up, and see what she can do.) Now it is Ti West's turn at bat, a director known for \"fringe\" pictures but, to be fair, this type of film probably qualifies as fringe too. Although a great many directors (including, believe it or not, the great Tarantino and even Eastwood himself) have taken on the challenge of this genre, the truth is that Sergio Leone -- the man who invented the category -- is the only director in history to have fully mastered it. (Have seen the Man With No Name trilogy a half-dozen times so far, and I am not done yet.) Which does not mean -- as the other reviewers have already noted -- that the attempt, even if it falls short a mite, cannot be fun. And this movie definitely qualifies as fun. Hawke is a great choice, at the same time skittish, taciturn, and yet also strangely dangerous. Travolta will always be Travolta. He has been playing the same role since Kotter, and audiences never get bored. The most fun is watching Taissa Farmiga chew up the furniture. Clearly the young lady wants to show the world that she has her sister's acting chops, so she does not merely enter a scene, she attacks it and wrestles it to the ground. In different circumstances, this strange brew might have missed the mark. But it didn't. Clearly West's main goal was to entertain. And that is exactly what he did.",
         "Paul is a man that is trying to leave everything and go to Mexico but on his way he encounters a drunk priest and passes through town Denton and manages to draw trouble to himself. Plot is very well developed allowing you to see that Paul is running away from something and has lost touch with world. After being challenged by Gilly and beating him up we are aware of his strength and capability. Then after being forced to leave town, he was followed by Gilly and his men. Killing his dog and trying to kill him obviously left his in agony and thirst for blood, he decides to go back in town. On way to town encounters priest one more time but he was so drunk that he didn't manage to shoot him so once more he got beat up by Paul. When he returned to town it was a cold blooded shoot out for every men except Gilly, he hang him and beat him eventually leading to Mary-Anne shooting him. Marry-Anne character is also incredible as she is young and wants to be taken care of but falling in love with Paul from the first moment she saw him. On the other hand Clyde, Gilly's father is a marshal that leads town that wanted to peace out with Paul and bring some reason to all and in doing so got shoot. Only bad part was when you are being shown flashbacks from Paul's past that was kind of poorly done and felt wrong. Ethan Hawke as Paul is absolutely amazing with his acting as well as Travolta with some long monologues and great dialogue. Others didn't quite fit and some gave not so good performances. Movie also uses a weird sense for humour it was absurd at times but sometimes gets it. Directing of the movie was fine there were some pretty good scenes with a lot of tension and script is at times amazing and sometimes fails to achieve it's true potential. Same goes for dialogues some were great and there were times when it was hard to listen them mostly because they were silly. Musical score was pretty good and well balanced. 2.5/4",
         "I read some reviews here criticizing this movie as too much of a satire, so I went in with a cautious mind. I surely didn't want a straight-up comedy or a movie that has too much commentary about its genre. I'm happy to say that \"In a Valley of Violence\" is played very straight, it's a traditional loner western with a revenge plot. There is nothing quite new here, and you'll see plenty of clichés played out. Which suggests that Ti West wanted to pay homage to traditional, small-scaled westerns. So if you want something profound or fresh to challenge your intellect, you'd want to look elsewhere. But there is something to this film. Most of the characters, despite not having much depth, are fun to follow. They have that certain spark to them, most of them are over the top and very on-the-nose. It doesn't reach Tarantino-levels in the way these characters are portrayed, but the fact that this comparison even came to my mind is telling. You don't get that invested in the characters, but you start to enjoy them nonetheless - which is good, because the movie is carried by this weird little group of people. The scale is small, and there are only a few people on the screen, so it's that much more important. Ti West's other movie \"The Innkeepers\" had the same element to it, and he just might be a pretty good director concerning characters, making them even remotely interesting when the premise or material doesn't help. Actors are fine. My favorite was Taissa Farmiga, who was a sweet blabbermouth. Even John Travolta did fine, and Tommy Nohilly was good too. James Ransone was absolutely hamming it up at times, which was a nice contrast to Ethan Hawke who played it straight. Ethan Hawke doesn't have much of a range here, and he's not supposed to either, but he always delivers just by his mere presence. He's one of those actors I just enjoy watching, no matter the movie, and this one is no exception. Karen Gillan was certainly having fun with her role, as most people did. Perhaps that's it, the charm this movie had: people were having fun and some of it translated to the screen. Otherwise the movie would have been very dry. Oh yeah, and the dog helped too. There's something to be said about cinematography in Ti West's films (although I've only seen three). There is something intimate and warm to it. Nothing feels pretentious or grand, but at the same time not too familiar either. They're easy on the eye in a lovely way. I hope Ti West makes more films, I'm starting to get interested. \"In a Valley of Violence\" isn't deep. It's probably a love letter to simple westerns, and isn't trying to do anything what it can't achieve. For this movie that particular approach works well. It's a simple story about simple characters with some weird charm to it. It's not very engaging, but I found it very enjoyable nonetheless. There is nothing cynical about this movie, even though we've seen this story a thousand times, and it warmed my heart. If you like simple, confined movies and you're willing to adjust your expectations, this might be worth the shot for you too.",
         "\"A town run by sinners.\" Priest (Burn Gorman) Yep, Denton, Texas, is all that and more. It resides In A Valley of Violence, the titular warning to all of us that beside the dust, nothing is going to be pretty. But don't be so gloomy, for this oater is a genre hooter, a tongue-in-cheek satire of the Western generously seasoned with absurdity and dark comedy. From the serious take of Clint Eastwood (think The Good, the Bad and the Ugly; Unforgiven; or whatever) to Quentin Tarantino (think Pulp Fiction and The Hateful Eight), this Valley is temporarily governed by an ambivalent Marshal (John Travolta) and a stoic drifter, Paul (Ethan Hawke). They are bound to clash as the Marshal tries to protect his lame-brained but hostile son, Gilly (James Ransone), from Paul's vengeance. Not so much because Gilly and the resident thugs employed by the Marshal are robbers or even lazy but because they have murdered Paul's ever-so- cute dog Abby (Jumpy). Because that mutt is more adorable than The Artist's Uggie, we shift our sympathy immediately to him and forsake the humans. Talking about shifting realities, the town is set in Texas but filmed in New Mexico, whose landscape thankfully looks nothing like Texas's. Writer/director Ti West, best known for horror films but just as much at home with this genre, has an especially good eye for the contradictions in the Marshal, who is a saint next to Gene Hackman's menacing Sheriff in The Quick and the Dead. But then, our hero Paul has his own contradictions, best to be enjoyed while watching the film, for character development is not West's primary goal. No, he is interested in spoofing the Western while he crafts a blood and guts mini thriller. Along the way we can enjoy Jeff Grace's Morricone-like spaghetti Western music and titles and credits worth of the playful Tarantino and James Bond franchise. He does this all to produce an enjoyable black comedy whose absurdity is in check while its comedy wins the day.",
         "In a valley of violence is a pretty low key western starring Ethan Hawke as an unlikely hero out to avenge the death of his beloved dog. This part of the plot sounds similar to John Wick but that's where the similarities end. Hawke is a drifter who ends up in a run down town controlled by the Marshall played by John Travolta. He has an altercation with the marshals son who is the town bully and is advised to leave town. Even though he does so he is still attacked and left for dead by the Marshall's son and his cronies who kill his only friend and companion Abby the dog. And from there the story becomes one of revenge. From the opening credits and the music score it becomes clear that the director is a fan of the old spaghetti westerns. The story is pretty basic although what separates this movie from the old spaghetti westerns is that the hero at first tries to avoid confrontations. He just wants to be left alone. Even when he is pursued by a young girl running a hotel in the town. He is in fact not a brave hero but a mass murdering army deserter who left his wife and daughter to enlist in the army and never went back. The Marshall who is portrayed as the main villain also tries to prevent bloodshed till the very end and never actually kills anyone. Even the other villains in the movie are not typical gun wielding psychopaths and in fact most of the people shooting guns end up missing their targets most of the time. There is also some comedic dialogue between the characters as well as great scenes of the dog interacting with Hawke's character. Overall this is a fun western movie that does not go for all out gunfights or bloodshed and yet there is still enough fighting in it so it does not get bogged down in dialogue. Ultimately the whole plot is basic and there is no real reason for what occurs other than the fact that someone was at a wrong place in the wrong time. A nice homage to the more dramatic westerns of the 60s and 70s.",
         "Considering this is basically what Ti West cooked up following a double viewing of John Wick and any given Sergio Corbucci flick, it's... really f***** good! Damn I'll just go ahead and say it: I was more entertained by this than John Wick (some of that I simply chalk up to Hawke being a more emotional and curious presence than Reeves, personal preference, and beyond the premise and some key moments it's not exactly the same as that). This is no masterpiece or anything, and I don't necessarily think it was trying to be. West clearly loves this genre, and wants to do his own twist on it, which carries some especially graphic violence (if you had trouble with movies like The Thing, don't watch this), and some strong supporting work from Karen Gillan and John Travolta (the guy who plays Travolta's son, the real main bad-guy, is one note but the actor plays him for all his worth). This kind of well-produced, surprisingly and wildly funny straight-faced homage western (especially near the super intense and, as the title says, violent climax, that threw me for a loop, such as everything with the one guy who protests being called by his nickname by John Travolta and demands to be called 'Lawrence') is something that pleases me. If it's ever on TV I'll stop and watch it. 7.5/10",
         "At least \"In a Valley of Violence\" is not as agonizingly predictable as the director's previous waste of time. I am someone who believes that a movie without one single moment you couldn't imagine after reading a one sentence, or even one word, description of the plot, is a movie you have no reason to watch. How is it that you know the name Ti West? A guy whose movies are as formulaic as these should be directing episodes of Big Bang Theory. But he does do them well, and gives his superior actors room to breathe. The problem is that he \"writes\" these movies himself \u2013 if you can call stringing a bunch of clichés together \"writing\". This is a movie that is so predictable that you don't notice the genre clichés that would have rubbed you wrong in a better movie, i.e.. the main character being the typical hard-bitten and reluctant hero type who doesn't say much, who never intended to draw steel but ended up being forced to. And how about the town being basically just two rows of houses with a \"main street\" running down the middle? Is there a \"saloon\" with rooms to rent upstairs? How about a plucky young heroine who dreams of escape and thinks the hero might be her ticket out? He doesn't take her at first. Of course. No, it was the smaller details that rubbed me wrong. For example: before killing his first victim, why does the typically terse hero suddenly become insanely verbose, rabbiting on like someone who has truly lost control of himself? What was the point of the speech where he outlines exactly what he's doing as if it wasn't already completely obvious, not only to the audience, but also the victim? And when the bad guy has the plucky heroine up against the wall with a gun to her throat, and he begins threatening her, what does she do next? Her response is engraved in stone, alongside the \"all towns in Westerns are just two rows of houses with a street down the middle\" rule, in a tablet enshrined in the Screenwriters' Guild bathroom. When the camera focused on the heroine's determined eyes in the climax, I cringed. This is West relying not only on cliché, but on the trend of the day: girl power. Having read this far, you might wonder why I didn't give the film a lower rating. The answer is that for all the predictability, \"In a Valley of Violence\" has actors who you can't help watching and rooting for, especially Taissa Farmiga, one of the best young actors in the world, who gives this tired material more energy than it deserves.",
         "I like Hawke in this role. He does a good job. In fact the whole cast does a good job. This movie however is just written on napkin. It's like a class for writing where the teacher asks what are the main elements of western and then you tie a thin red string through that. I do not understand why big names are in this movie at all. I thought perhaps maybe there was a national competition and that fresh out of school kids won and that the actors joined up for charity's sake. There is however some humor in this movie. They sort of managed to make traditional western dialogue a bit cheeky. I managed to get through it, but I was questioning why the whole time. 3:10 to Yuma or True Grit are great movies. This does not make the cut.",
         "While this movie isn't as bad as it tried to be, it's still not great. The plot is slow moving and predictable. I know it was supposed to be made, based very loosely, on Clint Eastwood's spaghetti westerns but it's not even close to that level. Besides, Eastwood never told anyone his name in the movies, you just saw the tombstone. From the time Gilly starts harassing him in the bar, you know exactly what is going to happen. You can predict scene after scene and it brings nothing special to the screen. Ethan tries hard to look the part with his eyes and his gravel voice is decent but as for the other non-speaking action from Travolta to Ransone, it's severely lacking. Travolta could have been a little more convincing if he had tried but this looked like a half-ass attempt at acting in his first western. I don't know what they were thinking with the flashback scenes and it was confusing. He says he left his wife and child but you see a dead woman and child in a flashback. He says he's a killer but obviously he's not in the sense of the old westerns. The flashbacks were so poorly approached that I had to fast forward the movie through them because of the way they were filmed, looking like someone was holding a bad flashlight, it was hard to follow along and try to see what the director was trying to convey. Finally, the cliff scene is so unbelievable it's unfathomable. They throw a man off a cliff and he survives, walking fine, no problems, etc. He obviously hit rock and fell through some brush so you'd think he would at least have a few scrapes and bruises but there isn't anything there to indicate he had been thrown down a cliff. I don't mind the wasted time watching the movie once but I won't watch it again.",
         "This film looked promising until about halfway through, when it descended into mediocrity. The dialogue is poorly written, characters clichéd and action scenes predictable. If Tarantino had made it, it would at least have had good dialogue, but without that it is just a chore to watch. Ethan Hawke plays a mystery man travelling with his dog through Texas to Mexico for some reason. Along the way he meets an array of unsavoury characters who insist on popping up again and again. You can predict their appearance well ahead of their arrival on screen every time. The dog is cute but performs so many cute tricks I wondered aloud if this was actually a kid's film. Nope, rated R. Shame really, since kids might not have seen all the various clichés 1000 times already and find this film more entertaining than I did. If originality and creativity are not your thing, you might enjoy this film. Otherwise, proceed with lowered expectations.",
         "I find it so frustrating to read review after review hailing these fringe movies and leading the movie goers astray. I've no financial interest in any of the movies I review, I tell it like it is for the typical movie goer with hope that my honest appraisal is what you are seeking. Now to this movie.....Ti West wrote & directed this movie, so what! Who's he? My 11 year old grandson could of written as good a script as this want-a-be spaghetti western. If for any reason you are going to watch this movie because Ti West is involved just forget it, if this is an example of his movie making, maybe he should try another profession because good film making is NOT his thing. Well what about the acting you ask? Terrible comes to mind, pathetic also fits in nicely. Whatever possessed John Travolta & Ethan Hawke to tie their wagon to this is beyond me. Both of those guys were better before, obviously they've either fallen on hard times and good roles don't come their way anymore or else they are broke and sold their acting soul for the almighty dollar. The entire cast over acts, maybe it's the writing, I think it's that deadly combination of terrible acting and even worst writing. I love western movies, I'm always looking for good ones to watch. While the story was corny, the acting horrid, the dialog was stupid, and the out-come predictable, the movie was watchable. I did not fast forward any part of this one, I sat through it all right to the bitter end. I think the reason why I was able to endure this movie is only because I do like western movies and this one kind of fits the bill. When you are deciding if you should watch this movie or not, I'm hopeful my review at least sets the table for you. Unless you are a die-hard western fan, I'd say take a serious pass on this want-to-be movie.",
         "This is a waste of good talent. Don't shoot my Dog. Seriously? Hollywood green lit this one dimensional terrible script. Nothing happens except the main characters dog gets shot and killed. BFD. Lets seek revenge for my dog. hahaha And nothing else really happens besides that main event. Pointless script. Maybe the director loves Dogs...or just had a limited budget and no funds to write a 2nd and 3rd act and only could afford to use his buddy's stunt dog. Great acting by the dog. Heck this movie might turn into a cult comedy classic as it is so darn stupid. I give it a 3 because at least the camera work is decent.. great music, but what a waste on such a terrible script. hard to imagine why on earth Hawke and Travolta signed up maybe for a trip to New Mexico. Crazy what has happened to Hollywood low budget films. At least Corman did not pretend to take himself serious like this Direct to Video film. 3",
         "This movie is terrible. The dialogue is completely incongruous with the 'characters '. Completely predictable, lacking any suspense or interest. The only redeeming feature except to laugh at is some decent music. I can't believe Ethan Hawke and John Travolta made this movie. It is almost as bad as Battlefield Earth.",
         "Greetings from Lithuania. \"In a Valley of Violence\" (2016) made with by ~ 8 actors and on a budget ~20 times smaller then \"The Magnificent Seven\" (2016) which i saw recently, is like ~4 times more involving and better then \"The Magnificent\". And basically they both have very similar premises, but boy oh boy what do more compelling writing and directing can make for a final result - film itself. Its not that \"In a Valley of Violence\" is a perfect film, its not, but loved its ~45 min. highly and after i understood where everything is moving to and i didn't get any surprises from that point, i still was involved into this simple and many times already seen story. This is what good movie making is all about. Overall, \"In a Valley of Violence\" isn't original, nor it is highly superbly made, but it gives to you exactly what it promises - a good old fashion western with some blood and etc. Its far from great, but it is a pretty good one.",
         "What can you expect from a director who churns out horror flick main movies titled The House of the Devil and who is trying to make a western? You got it right: a horrible western. It is that bad. People who make horror flicks are generally, with few exceptions, not that right in the head. You can see the signs of weirdness all across this flick. Bad acting, bad story, ridiculous motivation of the characters. All fine for a 21-st century cheap scare but westerns cannot be done this way. Simply it won't go. Who uses the curse language of millennials' in the 19th century? Who cares if the director wants to be original? You just don't do this to westerns. People had very different values and demeanor back then. Even the criminals carried a sense of nobility due to the mores and the hard life they had to endure. The nervous wrecks of people in Ti West's rendition of a western were absolutely comical. What made me really laugh was that the main character, who seemed to be normal to a certain point in time, very typical tough soldier-cowboy type, and was actually a maniacal animal lover. Complete idiot. Why John Travolta and Ethan Hawk decided to take part in this caricature remains a mystery to me. Maybe short on cash. Bad movie, a horror to the western genre. Ti West should not have gone western.",
         "What a lousy B movie. The screenplay could never be worse. The scenario and the plot both failed miserably. The dialog also felt wooden and unnatural. The characters in it all looked funny and out of place. There's nothing you could help making this movie even worth paying more attention. Two young women wearing nicely custom made dresses in a middle of nowhere deserted town, running a hotel without any help? The whole on-going of the story simply felt hollow and awkward to watch, panned out to nowhere. The gunfight in the street looked even more funny than you'd have usually seen. A cartoon-like preacher is totally unnecessary. A run-down dead town with population under 20 still got a grocery store, a bar, a hotel, and the males were all white trash thugs reigned by a crippled Marshall...blah, blah and blah. I have to tell you guys that this movie still worth watching. The only reason is that GREAT DOG. It's a SHE if you buy those guys in the movie called it. Her acting was so great and would even make a not-a-dog-loving guy like me fall in love with her. The dog's I.Q. obviously is higher than 60% of the human population on this planet. What a great dog!!!! Other than the dog, there's nothing worth watching in this movie. This dog was the only shinning and bright spot in it.",
         "I saw an early showing of this film many months bock, and can promise Everyone... if you like Westerns, even just a little... You Will enjoy this film as well. I walked into the theater not even knowing what to expect (as it is with most early previews of films), just having a basic idea that its going to be a western, based somewhat on revenge. I almost decided not to go too... but damn, I am glad I did. It moves at a decent pace, had really good characters, and even months later I still think of random scenes from it. There has been an increase in westerns lately, most being pretty good, and this one is no exception.﻿ I decided to write a review about it now because I honestly want people to go see this film and help it be a success. All the actors in it do an outstanding job, and the story keeps you entertained the whole time. Remember, I saw a early cut too... so it may have even been improved on by now, though even if it hasn't it wouldn't matter, its a great film regardless.",
         "This is one of the worse movies I have ever had the misfortune of seeing. Poor dialogue, poor acting, poor cinematography - it fails on all accounts. Imagine a high school play performed by amateurs with stilted, ungainly dialogue - that is better than this movie. I like Travolta and Hawke. They are both fine actors but this piece of crap makes them look bad. Whoever wrote the screenplay should be flogged. Even if you could fast forward the movie at 3-4 times speed it would still drag. I watched it to the end hoping for some glimpse of competency, some chance of redemption and was disappointed. If I paid to see this I would demand my money back. This is not worth watching even if you are bored and nothing else is playing. Stay away, stay far away.",
         "I liked this film, I thought the timing worked well, the build up of tension worked well in most scenes . The acting is decent, not sure why someone on here would say otherwise, my favourite character was the girl, Mary Anne,I liked her humour and compassion for Ethan Hawke. I also thought the overall humour worked well. I admit I'm an Ethan Hawke fan,but I don't like everything he's made.I'm not usually a western fan either,but somehow this pulled it off for me. I found myself wanting to watch it to the end. I was surprised to see Karen Gillan in this role, she usually does science fiction. So overall I think you could do a lot worse than watching this on a Saturday night, I enjoyed it,and i'm fussy !",
         "Ti West knows how to make stuff look good. \"The House of the Devil\" proved that, and just as that is a full on throwback to 80s slashers this is a throwback to old westerns. But it shares a lot of the same problems as it too. The script isn't very good. The acting is.. pretty bad.. to say the least in a couple of cases, no names mentioned. I do not understand why Toby Huss isn't given bigger roles though, he's an excellent actor and in this just like the American remake of Martyrs last year he only gets a few lines and no real character. Toby Huss is too good for this! The music is great! Kudos to the composer! The cinematography is where I thought Ti West could do something special, the great wide scope of old westerns are beautiful and with his \"copy/paste\"-style of film making it should be great, but this feels more like a modern thriller. The story in general is generic, pacing is way too slow, and there's a weird dream sequence lit with, what feels like, a flash light mounted to a hand held camera... That's not western at all. It would look bad in any movie but especially a western. No, save your money on this good people! Watch \"Das finstere Tal\"(aka Dark Valley), one best western this side of the millennium!",
         "In a Valley of Violence stars Ethan Hawke as a wandering deserter, Paul, who happens upon the town of Denton. Run by a tough but fair Marshall, and his psychotic son and cronies, the town has seen better days. Paul is just looking to pick up some supplies for his journey to Mexico, but runs afoul of the Marshall's son. He tries his best not to become involved, but soon finds himself gunning for revenge in a town that needs saving. This was a well made Western heavily stylized after many classic Spaghetti Westerns. It had many campy elements, and presented a lower budget sheen that really nails the Spaghetti Western feel. The acting was competently done, with some moments feeling cheesy and slightly comical, and others offering some heart. The direction was solid, with scenes, close ups, vistas and so on handled with care. The story itself was predictable, but far from bland. The relationship between Paul and his dog, Abbey, was especially well done. All in all, this was a fun and campy Western very much paying homage to the Spaghetti Westerns of the '60's and '70's. It is worthy of a watch for those interested in Western films, and certainly for fans of the more campy Spaghetti films.",
         "I liked the post Spaghetti Clint Eastwood westerns of the late 1960's and early 1970's. This movie deconstructs those stories and presents you with real characters. This movie fleshes out real people from those movies as I would expect to meet them: the Preacher was from 2 Mules For Sister Sara was nasty and mean while the man with no name reluctantly gives a name. Ethan Hawkes character is not just a loner, but also lonely with a haunting past. The gang of men who try to kill him as in the movie Hang 'Em High are fleshed out as readily manipulated men with a mean guy who is the son of the Marshall. The Ethan Hawkes character comes back for vengeance is not the man who wants to paint the town red like High Plains drifter, but a man who wants to kill only those who killed his dog, a true companion that has personality and charm you care for. John Travolta's Marshall is perceptive and brave, the antithesis of the sheriff in Joe Kidd. Yet it's Taissa Farmiga's character Mary-Anne that steals the scenes she is in with a strong female character (not a version of a woman playing a man's role) that is distinctive from what I have seen in a movie. There was humor and intelligence with a restraint of no guns being fired until the 3rd act. This is not a great movie (few are) but it took me into an interesting relatable world (where many movies fail). It deserves a wide viewing and not the current low rating.",
         "This film tells the story of a lone man who travels around with his dog in the cowboy country. The lone man stumbles upon a town where the son of the marshal picks a fight with him, leading to a series of bloody revenges. \"In a Valley of Violence\" has a very simple and linear plot. The lone man is aggravated, there is revenge then more counter-revenge. The simplicity of the plot means that the pace is quite slow. I find the first half rather uneventful and lacks excitement. The second half picks up and is much better. I like Ethan Hawke's calm character, standing up to the son of the marshal, who is the local bully. The local bully evokes disgust as he is very unlikable. I am not usually a fan of Western films, but \"In a Valley of Violence\" is alright to watch."
