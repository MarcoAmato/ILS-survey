Hollywood is full of the bastards!\r\nC) Hire one of the like... 3 actors who can actually do the job outside of these two options.\r\nKate McKinnon is not one of those 3 actors.\r\n\r\n...Oh and also _Rough Night_ was not very good.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:★½: - Boring/disappointing.

So I watched it not expecting anything special out of it. And I did not get any. But... it was okayish. Moreover, Scarlett Johansson was the main reason I wanted to watch it. You can't always do superhero, action films. This is something offbeat. Often need to take this path, no to fail miserably, but to relax from the mainstream. So this was enjoyable, but not by all.\r\n\r\nIt is like the female version of 'Hangover'. Five friends go to Miami for one of theirs bachelorette party. It's supposed to be fun without any rules, but a disaster strikes in the early and makes them to cover all the evidence. The night turns their worst nightmare ever. How they manage to come out of it are the remaining film that revealed with a twist at the end.\r\n\r\nThe reception was as expected, but it was not that bad if you are seeking only a timepass. It ended like there could be a sequel, but now it seems very unlikely. One of the issues with the film is it was so traditional narrative. With so many jokes repeated from other flicks. The majority won't approve that. As far as I think it is watch and forget kind of film. An average film. Disliking it does not change what it is!\r\n\r\n_6/10_",

      "synopsis": "The film opens during a college Halloween party in 2006. Best friends Jess (Scarlett Johansson) and Alice (Jillian Bell) are playing beer pong while their friends Blair (Zoe Kravitz) and Frankie (Ilana Glazer) cheer them on. Jess and Alice have one cup left to hit, and Alice is nervous. Jess encourages her friend to win, and Alice shoots the ball from her mouth into the cup. Everyone cheers. Alice carries Jess on her back until Jess hits her head on the doorway and falls. Afterwards, the four ladies go to Jess and Alice's room to talk about Jess going to study abroad the following semester. They vow to stay friends forever. Then one of their schoolmates drunkenly walks into the room and starts peeing on the floor. Ten years later. Jess is living in Washington DC and currently running for a state senator position. Her campaign managers think she comes off kind of uptight in her ads and suggest that she loosen up. Jess is also engaged to a guy named Peter (Paul W. Downs). Alice, who is now a teacher and living somewhere else, keeps trying to get in touch with Jess for an upcoming bachelorette party they have planned. Jess just wants to spend some alone time with Peter, but he tells her it's okay to take Alice's calls. Peter drives Jess to the airport to meet with Alice so they can head to Miami for the party. Alice is excited so they can be \"swimming in dicks.\" When they get to Miami, they meet up with Blair (now a New York City lawyer going through a custody battle with her ex-husband for their three-year-old son) and Frankie (now a jobless activist), both of whom still have a bit of a thing going on since their brief romantic relationship in college. The ladies get together, and Alice pulls out a bottle of champagne. Frankie pops it open, but the loud noise freaks everyone in the airport out. The ladies arrive at their beach house that they rented for the weekend. They meet their neighbors, Pietro (Ty Burrell) and Lea (Demi Moore), both of whom are very sexually active swingers and are particularly attracted to Blair. That night, the ladies go out to dinner. Jess wants to call it an early night but her friends are devoted to giving her the time of her life. Jess invites her Australian friend Pippa (Kate McKinnon) to join them, making Alice clearly jealous. Frankie gets up to go to the bathroom and comes back with some cocaine, getting her friends to join her for some bumps. The friends continue their night on the town by heading to a nightclub. Alice gets wasted and starts puking. Then the ladies enter a talent competition doing a performance from when they were in college, but it gets ruined when Alice goes for a trust fall and nobody catches her. While dancing, Blair suggests to the others that they get Jess a stripper. The five friends get back home to the beach house and all of them continue doing drugs (smoking pot and snorting cocaine). The stripper, Jay (Scott Cooper), shows up. After using the bathroom, he begins to striptease for Jess. She's enjoying it until he calls her a slut. Alice then wants in on the action, so she jumps on Jay, accidentally knocking him over and causing him to hit his head on the edge of the fireplace. His head starts bleeding and the ladies freak out. Despite their efforts to help him, Jay is dead. Everyone panics since the house is made of glass and people can see them. The pizza man shows up, so Pippa answers the door to cover things up while the others try moving the body. Meanwhile, Peter is hanging out with his buddies for a wine-tasting session when he decides to call Jess. Jess is too nervous to talk and she blabs that something went wrong with a stripper/prostitute (Frankie says she got him off Craigslist). When Peter asks if she still wants to get married, Jess freaks out again when Frankie takes her phone and smashes it. Peter is left thinking Jess is cheating on him. At the behest of his friends, he is inspired to drive all the way down to Miami and win her back. He makes a stop at a convenience store for adult diapers and energy drinks. The ladies continue trying to hide the body. Frankie and Blair leave briefly to purchase a cell burner phone, leaving the other three with a dog running up to the house in front of Jay's body. Pippa tries to send the dog away before his owner appears, and she gets her left wrist bitten. They try moving the body to the garage, but the door malfunctions and the cab bringing Frankie and Blair back almost catches them. The friends realize they have no choice but to hide the body in the closet on a sex swing. Blair calls her Uncle Jack (Peter Francis James) to ask for advice. Jack says that they all could be charged for involuntary manslaughter, but with lack of evidence, they wouldn't have a case. Then he mentions that they shouldn't touch the body, but Pippa admits they already moved him. Jack says this could mean up to 15 years in prison, but then he tells the ladies if there's no body, then there's no case. The ladies contemplate chopping up the body, but they can't go through with it. They decide to take a jet ski to go out and dump Jay's corpse into the ocean. Before they can do it, Pietro and Lea come outside under the assumption that the ladies are going skinny-dipping. Pippa has to pretend to make out with Jay to avoid suspicion. The couple leaves, so the ladies say some final words for Jay before Pippa rides the jet ski far enough to dump the body. She then rides it back to the shore so fast that she flies off it and lands on her neck, but she's fine. However, Alice sees that the couple has a security camera that has possibly recorded them dumping the body. They all look at Blair for the next part of their plan. Blair reluctantly talks Pietro and Lea into sex outside by the beach so that they can have it filmed by the security cameras. After a very passionate session (off-camera), Blair asks for the tape, but the couple says that the cameras don't work since they don't pay for the service. Blair is pissed at her friends for making her go through with that, but they are just glad they are safe. They proceed to clean up all the blood in the living room. Meanwhile, Peter continues his road trip up to Miami in his diaper and hopped up on energy drinks and expired Russian speed pills. He gets pulled over by a cop for speeding, but he lets him go with a ticket. Peter then stops to get gas but his card is declined. He puts together money by encountering two separate weird guys after washing their cars. The first guy offers Peter meth and asks for a blowjob, but Peter refuses. The second guy wants to blow Peter and asks for meth, so Peter introduces the two guys and gets his gas money. At the beach house, Alice wants to do a \"Human Friendtipede\" photo outside. When they look at the picture, they see that Jay's body has washed up on the shore. They put Jay back on the sex swing, and they all hear a loud knocking at the door from someone claiming to be a cop. Frankie answers the door while the others hide. The cop, Scotty (Colton Haynes), enters and tells Frankie to get up against the wall. Scotty starts to frisk her, and Frankie headbutts him, knocking him out cold. The ladies try to pick Scotty up, but they rip off his uniform, meaning HE was the real stripper, but now they don't know who Jay was. The ladies bring Scotty upstairs to rest. Everyone is tense and still freaking out, leading to a big argument. Frankie and Blair go at it while Pippa calls Alice out for her behavior toward her all evening. Blair then lets it slip that Jess had a bridal shower that Alice wasn't invited to. Jess then admits to Alice that she is always making Jess spend time with her and making her feel guilty for not doing so, and that the bachelorette party was mostly for Alice to prove that her life doesn't suck. Alice is hurt, and Jess goes upstairs to calm herself down. Moments later, another knock is heard at the door. Two guys, Frazier (Dean Winters) and Ruiz (Enrique Murciano), claim to be detectives and ask for Jay. Alice answers the door and admits that Jay is dead. They show the guys Jay's body in the closet. Frazier says this was self-defense, so the ladies are off the hook. They cheer the fact that they are safe. Frazier then asks the ladies about diamonds that Jay stole and is hiding. Pippa then sees on the TV that police are looking for Jay, Frazier, and Ruiz, who are all diamond thieves. Although Pippa tries to alert the other ladies, the guys hear the news report and hold the ladies hostage, plus Scotty when he wakes up and starts screaming. Jess finds a card from Alice that says how much their friendship means to Alice because Jess was her first true friend when they were in school. Jess then hears the commotion downstairs. Frazier goes up and gets sprayed in the face with hairspray. Jess gets his gun and forces him to handcuff himself to the sink while she goes to save her friends. She aims her gun at Ruiz, who has everyone tied up together. Before she can pull the trigger, Ruiz moves and Jess has it aimed at Alice. She stops herself quickly and instead leaps off the balcony to tackle Ruiz. While she fights him, the others grab Ruiz's gun, and Alice shoots him in the leg before Jess bludgeons him with a statue. Jess goes to help her friends, but Frazier uncuffed himself since the keys were attached to the cuffs. He prepares to kill them until Peter drives through the front of the house, slamming into Frazier and killing him. Jess goes over to Peter, who still thinks Jess was cheating. She clarifies things and says she still wants to get married, and even suggests that they do it immediately. The next day, Jess and Peter are married at a foam party that Alice got tickets to, with Pippa officiating. The friends all enjoy the party, with Frankie and Blair getting back together, and Alice going to hook up with Scotty. Jess then gets a call from one of the campaign managers who tells her that the story of her and her friends taking out the diamond thieves is big news, bringing in lots of sponsors and volunteers, inspiring confidence in Jess's election. She is asked to come back to start interviews, but she chooses to stay to enjoy time with Peter and her friends. During the credits, we see that Jess has officially been elected state senator. Pippa goes up to perform a song with painfully obvious lyrics about them killing a guy. After the credits, Jess and Peter take Alice home from the party. Alice goes to make herself some penis pasta, and she discovers the stolen diamonds which were hidden in that pasta box the whole time.",

         "I had a Rough Night seeing this film (Ba-dum, tsh!). It's a comedy but all of the jokes and gags I remember from it are ones that are well past their due date. Toilet humor, creepy swinger couple, STD jokes, bad fake accents, and the dumb selfish best friend that ruins the main character's life and acts like a hypocrite just to name a few. There's also much pop culture riddled throughout the film which will likely already date this film within the next couple years or so, such as when the film tries to make a jab at president Donald Trump by having a fictional political candidate who gets praise for posting dick pics to Twitter. Scarlet Johansen is the highlight of this film, which is faint praise considering what I think of her performances in Ghost in the Shell, Lucy, and Sing, and the character's friends are almost entirely intolerable and if this were reality she would be best off without them, but of course this movie has to be about how friends are the most important thing in the world even when they're self-centered alcoholics who literally get off with manslaughter. It's a minimum-effort dark comedy which fails to do both at the same time, which is quite important to do as the two tones literally clash with each other and the movie has to backpedal to try to remind you it's a comedy. YouTube comedy musician Bo Burnham also makes a minor appearance in this film, and he ends up being both more funny and charismatic than the actual male lead in the film despite his limited acting experience. There is very little in terms of plot in this film. It's Weekend at Bernie's with women instead of men. The movie ends with the cliché sort of happily ever after type ending, confirming the characters are all terrible people and having them gloat in being rewarded for it. This feels like a product made by machines and algorithms rather than actual human beings, and just perpetuates the stereotype that women are unfunny.",
         "Some momentary chuckles were the highlight. For goodness sake get an Australian actress next time you want an Aussie accent. Wasn't even close and then she only kept it for about 2 lines. Don't spend money on this",
         "Wow, I don't know how I can even have given it 2 points - everything about this movie sucks; it's badly written, bad acting, totally unfunny and a bunch of characters I couldn't care less about. It's absolute rubbish, totally predictable and you've seen it a million times before - you have been warned, watch at your own peril!",
         "i cant tell you how bad this movie is. it reminded me of a weekend at Bernie's but that was a lot funnier and everything about that seemed to gel where this didn't. if you want to watch a funny movie.. this isn't it. I found the some of the characters to be very annoying and not even funny. I couldn't watch all of it due to it being that bad.",
         "This movie is derivative of several other gross-out movies about bachelor party shenanigans, full of dopey people doing gross, stupid things. Penis jokes, male strippers, guzzling booze, doing drugs, all a a feverish 'isn't this funny?? Isn't it? Isn't it??' by people really too OLD to be acting so stupid.....Hey, spring break is for the stupid YOUNGER crowd. It's all wearying and tiresome, been done to death, and frankly it's just embarrassing. (anyone remember the 'WOOOO! Girls' in the bar, in the TV show 'How I Met Your Mother'? WOOOOO!) Good lord, Grow UP! I thought Scarlet Johansson fancied herself a 'serious' actress. It seems she will take on any random role if she thinks it will make money. Did she really read the script and think, oh this is box office GOLD, it will really advance my career!.. Just being associated with this foolish movie is a really huge step back.",
         "Scarlett must have been doing cocaine for real if she thought this was gonna be a sweet funny movie. Wrong!!! what a piece of stupid crap. I only laughed at how f\"ing stooooopid this was. This movie needs another honest review of crappity crap. Really? over a 5 rating on avg? This is not even worth watching after about the 5th minute.",
         "I don't get people giving this movie 5 stars but admitting it wasn't funny or good. Sure the actors in it are good but we already know they are good. You wouldn't give Rachel Weisz 5 stars for a commercial for tampons no matter how much it seemed like she was on her period. This movie deserves less than a single star - no disrespect for the actors - OK maybe a little disrespect because while I know it is expensive to heat a pool couldn't you make just as much money doing a commercial in Japan for Super Fantastic Fun Time Energy Drink (you'll say two words in Japanese, smile and give a thumbs up)? Each and every one of you need a better agent as your craft is your band and you diminished it by accepting these roles.",
         "I love TV show Broad City and was looking forward to this because two of the creatives behind that show paired up to give us Rough Night. The generic title (a switch from Move that Body which was much more suitable) should have warned me. Rough Night is forgettable and not really that funny. The movie starts out in 2006 where a group of 4 friends get drunk at Halloween, win a beer pong competition and vow to stay friends forever. Fast forward 10 years and the group is reuniting for Jess's (Scarlett Johansson, bland, bland, bland, comedy is NOT her forte) bachelorette weekend at a fancy house in Miami. They party, snort coke, are joined with Jess's Australian friend Pippa (Kate McKinnon in a role that MUST have been written for Rebel Wilson. Surely?). Her friends decide to get Jess a stripper and here is when things go wrong: high on coke they accidentally end up killing the stripper and things quickly spiral out of control as they first try to do the responsible thing of calling the police and then move on to hiding the body. There was minor protests before the film being released about the movie making a punchline of killing sex workers but the film could have overcome this and he gruesome premise if not for a few things. First of all the women lack friendship chemistry. I don't believe any of these women were ever friends even if a big part of it is that they are supposed to have drifted apart. Second the casting is all awful. Scarlett is not a comedy actress and neither is Zoe Kravitz and it shows. Without being backed up by her hilariously crafted Broad City alter ego Ilana Glazer comes across as simply annoying. Kate McKinnon and Jillian Bell are probably the best with their characters but neither one is given much to do. McKinnon just leans hard into her accent and Bell is saddled with a \"loser desperate friend who can't take a hint\". The third thing is that the movie never quite finds it's tone. It struggles between \"woke\" dialogue for characters who are actually just mean and instead of simply leaning into the fact that these women are awful and allowing them to get even more absurdly awful it's way too protective of the characters and keeps trying to redeem them by making them \"nice\" people. It's both incredibly boring and keeps the movie from really flying. Still, Rough Night isn't a total write off. There are enough funny lines and a subplot (involving Jess's fiancé who the movie allows to get into REALLY ridiculous shenanigans) to be watchable. Just wish that the script would have let the ladies turn loose too.",
         "This movie was one of the worst I have seen for a while. Bad taste, weak humour, distasteful characters and a waste of my life. I'm just grateful that I was sitting down. I was staggered at the times other movie watchers actually laughed. Not a great deal of intelligence is obviously required to enjoy this load of rubbish.",
         "Not really good at all, Sometimes really stupid. The acting was pretty darn good, but would not watch again or recommend. It was hard watching the whole movie. Movie was just irritating. Scarlet Johansen should choose better scripts. A lady with talent, way above what this movie offers.",
         "I would give it 0 out of 10 if I could. Not only is the trope of killing a sex worker for a comedy movie completely tired out, disgusting, and dehumanizing, but this movie does nothing new. Same boring old comedy tropes, and relies entirely too much on slapstick comedy and penis/racism/sex jokes. I would avoid seeing this unless for some reason you enjoy these things.",
         "Bachelorette parties, a sacred ritual to help a young woman transition from single life into the world of marriage. Of course, like most things, modern traditions have adulterated with new traditions and rituals that leads for a rather \"exciting\" night. So why not make another movie about it. Tonight, my friend and I hit the theater to cover the latest comedy to \"grace\" the big screen entitled Rough Night! What does this obviously titled film have in store for us? As always, please read on to find out and help determine whether or not it is worth your money to hit the theater. So what do you get? For once the trailers were pretty spot on with their portrayal of this movie. Rough night is a very raunchy, simplistic, and over the top comedy that has little sustenance outside of the attempt at humor. It's ridiculousness at times is clever, but these moments are few and far between, buried under the comedy rubble that fills this movie. Aggressive innuendos come rushing out of the woodwork, many delivered in the overdramatic manner that somehow seems to be popular and entertaining to many. The all-star cast assembled to for this film are okay, dropping their dynamic acting range for superficial roles filled with cursing and satire. Lazy writing also doesn't help sell the comedy factor, primary thanks to the consistent cursing, shouting of the male genitalia, overzealous drug use, and cringe worthy catchphrases. Kate Mickinnon is able to salvage some parts of the film with her usual tricks, working the Australian accent with her pizazz and spot-on timing. Story wise, nothing special here. Rough Night's plot is about 80% revealed in the trailers and there is little surprise left for you in the audience. Some of the more adult moments will be the eye widening magic you are seeking, but again these are often awkward uncomfortable, or unnecessary. Still the movie's tale had some surprising character development and a nice twist thrown into the mix to help keep things dynamic. The morals hit close to home on some level, but again are robbed by another bout of stupidity. I know, you aren't there for the character developments and rugged plot, but other comedies have learned to balance things and that is where this movie fails. In the end though here are my likes and dislikes: LIKES: \u0095 Kate McKinnon \u0095 Good, upbeat soundtrack \u0095 Short Run Time \u0095 More dynamic storyline DISLIKES: \u0095 Incredibly stupid \u0095 Excessive cursing \u0095 Aggressive humor \u0095 Trailers Ruined most of the movie \u0095 Inappropriate at many times \u0095 Shallow story \u0095 Annoying characters \u0095 Dropped plots \u0095 Overacting \u0095 Limited target audience THE VERDICT: It's nice to see a movie fit the expectations set by the advertising, but it's sad that this is a form of entertainment. Rough night fails to find balance and resorts to cheap parlor tricks known as adult humor. Sure there are clever components (primarily thanks to the boyfriend and Kate), but even they can't save the movie from the monotonous laziness that is to come. kWhy must it be overacted? I don't know, but nevertheless this movie failed on many accounts. Recommended audience members include bachelorettes, girls nights out, or fans of one of the cast. For the rest though, skip this movie until it darkens the library of Netflix. My scores are: Comedy: 5.5 Movie Overall: 3.0",
         "Not sure why people are rating this so high. They try way too hard to make it funny. It was predictable...characters were stereotypes and there were weird long pauses after 'jokes' I guess for the audience to laugh? Which not many did. There was a scene in the trailer that wasn't even in the movie?!! Like what the? I wonder if they spent most of their budget getting Scar J or she owed someone a massive favor!",
         "Let's be honest here...Rough Night is probably the most unoriginal idea to hit theaters this summer. It has the storyline of Peter Berg's 1998 film Very Bad Things with a Weekend at Bernie's twist. Starring Scarlett Johansson, Kate McKinnon and Zoe Kravitz, the film's star power seems to have no shortage but the film's screenplay doesn't know what it wants to be. There are far too few thrills to classify it a thriller and, as far comedy is concerned, it is severely lacking. So we're given this cookie-cutter film that does its job (more or less). The film opens Hangover style, it introduces us to the gang of girls as they make their way to the bachelorette weekend to end all bachelorette weekends. Scarlett Johasson plays the bride to be while her bridesmaids are either overly sexual or prudes. There is not much of an in-between. No character felt real. They all felt like they were written specific to this event and that really didn't bode well with me. In a situational comedy like this, it helps to have a character we can relate to. This film really doesn't have a relateable character, just mere pawns in the film's game. The story itself moves pretty well through it's self proclaimed rough night but doesn't really latch on to you as a viewer. You're pretty much there to watch the ride...nothing else. The cast here is probably the best part of the film. Between the gravitas Johansson brings to the screen and the intrigue of Zoe Kravitz and the off the wall banter from Kate McKinnon, it would be a lie if I said they weren't at least fun to watch. The problem the film has is its dialog. If the film's goal wasn't to promote feminism and a pro-female image, I'd say it is passable. But the film portrays women either as sex-crazed drunkards or uptight prudes and coming off of Wonder Woman, this film seems like a slap in the face. Maybe it is poor timing or maybe it is true, only time will tell. Overall, the film isn't horrible. It features good performances from Kate McKinnon and Scarlett Johansson and makes the best of its boderline terrible script. It sustains its 101 minute runtime and fills them with countless penis jokes (Jillian Bell relies on them annoyingly too much) and features some decent moments of situational comedy that could have landed way better but they still land nonetheless. Either way, it is a passable film but not one that I'd recommend spending money to see in the theater.",
         "even good actress cannot make a bad movie... such a waste of time, predictable, the level of jokes for 11 years old, US based child, with not really developed brain and functions... I couldn't find one good world about this C-movie with big names. Awful! Its better to have a 90 min nap, really then watching this, 'art'. I don't even understand how such a video/DVD film can be distributed and sold. Its un-watchable and insulting intelligence of semi-developed human being:). Avoid it",
         "a male stripper died and some women tries to hide it by stupid jokes.for them death is a joke (like most of the white dark comedy movies) i think.poor direction and bad story.most of the Hollywood movies releasing in recent times are worse than any other industries.Hollywood should come up with some standard movies like 'manchester by the sea', else it will be a disaster for the industry.",
         "Gawd, who is this movie written for? Is it just an automatic money making \"no-brainer\" (and I mean that literally) to have a female coterie reunite years later for alcohol, partying, clubbing, male stripper all at an exclusive vacation locale? Plot has been done too many times including guys' versions. Fifty years of progress in portraying intelligent resourceful women has been reduced and characterized to loud intoxicated \"b..hes\" trying to outdo each other in acting the stupidest. Oh, more dumbness in added subplot of some stranger dying which expands into a not believable, suppose to be funny, crime clean up mess which itself has been done too many times in film. Demi Moore makes a brief appearance and as in \"Blind\" shows little acting skill. In both films she basically just hangs on some guy and smiles.",
         "Poorly written, poorly directed, and even more poorly acted. The story is so poorly realized they actually have to explain some of the jokes ,Others are just left hanging , so disappointing , i wish i could give zero star, the characters sucked , none of them was likable this movie was one of the worst I have seen for a while.",
         "Well, I liked it. It's not perfect, but I did find it fun even if every joke wasn't laugh-out-loud. I'd consider buying it. The first third before the death is the least funny part. The weakest jokes dominate this segment. Also, the character traits and their paths are all obvious, I admit this. But after it hits the fan, things get crazy. Things get increasingly insane throughout. Watching the characters panic and act weird was entertaining. As always, Kate McKinnon steals the show as the oddest one.",
         "I saw \"Rough Night\", starring Scarlett Johansson-Ghost in the Shell, The Prestige; Jillian Bell-Office Christmas Party, Bridesmaids; Zoe Kravitz- Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, X-Men:First Class and Kate McKinnon-SNL_tv, Office Christmas Party. This is a female version of the Hangover, with a little Weekend at Bernie's thrown in for good measure. The movie opens about 10 years earlier, with Scarlett, Jillian and Zoe in college and best friends. Jump to the present, and Scarlett is engaged to be married and her old friends want to throw her a bachelorette party in Miami. Kate is a newer friend of Scarlett's that joins them in Miami and becomes fast friends with everyone except Jillian, who seems to be just a tad jealous of her relationship with Scarlett. They all party, get drunk, do drugs, and wind up back at their rented beach house for some more fun. A male stripper is called and an accident happens that leaves the man dead. After a little brainstorming, the girls decide to get rid of the body but of course, things get even more complicated-nothing seems to go as planned. There is a funny cameo of some beach neighbors, who turn out to be swingers. As the end credits start, there is a scene and stay till the very end or you will miss an important plot point getting resolved. It's rated \"R\" for language, drug use, bloody images and sexual content- no real nudity but lots of penis shaped objects-and has a running time of 1 hour & 41 minutes. It's not quite as good as the Hangover was but it's good for some laughs and would be a good rental.",
         "I really laughed through the movie and watching it made me feel better. It did not have a very innovative plot, but it was enjoyable. The fact that women were in the center of the movie, doing what ever they wanted was another interesting thing. I recommend watching the movie when you feel like you want to watch a comedy. Overall, It was a very good comedy movie.",
         "This was pretty stupid wasn't as good as the hangover & to me it wasn't all that good...if you seen one you seen them all...super impractical & if you seen 1 you seen them all. Can't believe Scarlett J. Starred in this crap lol There were so many parts that was just super idiotic & not funny....only a couple of parts that were a little funny...super cheesy in general...if there is nothing else to watch sure but I would hate to know I spent money to watch it",
         "It's the movie that make you feel \"hey I'm not to old yet even if I'm 30 or 40 life is funny\" Really I went to the theater and all the crowd laughed so hard. It's all the point of the movie , to be fun and stupid, to show us we can take life easy, also it's about friendship and it's so cute. It's basically for girls to go and watch with you BFFs I came with no mood to the movie cause I had a hard day, and went out from it really cheerful :)",
         "Stop reading right now if you find gross-out comedies repulsive and don't like legitimate, well-known actors doing disgusting things that could ruin you for seeing them in any more serious efforts in the future. I love seeing actors let their hair down and go for it in the spirit of having a good time themselves and (more importantly) making audiences laugh while doing so, and \"Rough Night\" is a very good example of exactly that. Everyone here clearly had a terrific time on set, I have no doubt some of the funniest dialogue was improvised, and that kind of free-spirited energy spills over for the benefit of any willing audience members who are there to go along for the ride and have a good time, too. Yes, the film could've used a quicker editing pace, does flag just a bit a few times, and cutting it to a 90-minute-ish running time would've likely made it an even tighter, funnier, zippier ride. But I mean to emphasize the most important thing: I laughed--a lot, and so did the audience around me. All of the main ensemble are a hoot, and one of the reasons I love this genre of comedy is discovering new talented comedians I didn't know before, usually in smaller supporting roles--here it's Paul W. Downs as a soon-to-be-married \"6\" (out of 10--the script's reasoning for his friends rating him a 6 are hilarious) who decides no one's going to stand him up at the altar. His efforts to fight back are easily one of the best running gags in the film. I'm a huge fan of Kate McKinnon's--sometimes just the way she facially reacts to other actors' lines can have me lost in belly laughs--and she's a standout here, but everyone genuinely pitches in and goes for it--and I love 'em for it! Good comedies are so rare these days, and I run to every one on opening weekend to pay to support them, hoping more will be made. Overall the mainstream multiplex movie fare leaves me wanting these days, and I hope all-out comedies, there for no other reason than to make us laugh and lighten our days, never go away.",
         "If Bridesmaids (2011) was proof that the ladies can play just as rough in delivering truly inspired raunch-com moments, then Rough Night is incontrovertible proof that they can also deliver mediocre fair with the same lack of conviction as their coasting male counterparts. Is it funny; yeah in spurts. Can it be a little cloying; yeah at times. Is it the best version of what it could be? Perhaps that's the wrong question. Rough Night reunites college roommates Jess (Johansson), Alice (Bell) Blair (Kravitz) and Frankie (Glazer) who are planning one last blowout soiree before Jess takes the plunge into married life. They all rendezvous in sunny Miami, and meet up with Jess's friend from Australia Pippa (McKinnon). From there Alice plans a fun night on the town followed by a private party at their rented beach house. Things go terribly wrong however after the girls invite a stripper into the house and wind up with a dead body on their hands. Part of what will end up working for you about Rough Night has a lot to do with you look for in a comedy. At times the film channels the frazzled energy of The Hangover (2009) while at others it's stretching for the \"what are we going to do now\" immediacy of a Guy Ritchie crime comedy. It sometimes sinks in the tepid character dynamics of a late-period Blake Edwards sex comedy while at others times it outright revels in pure absurdity. The center narrative stitch however is farce - trading on the buffoonery of our characters to establish much of the movie's important story elements. This however becomes a crutch as the movie limps away from the halfway point. Once we get a good idea of what's going on, it becomes obvious that there just aren't enough levers for this movie to pull to keep everything going. And instead of relying on broad characters and an increasing array of improbable circumstances (the bread and butter of any good farce), the movie cuts back and forth between, not people but groups that are only tangentially related to the story proper. As a result Rough Night starves itself on its own lack of possibilities. Such groups by the way, include Demi Moore and Ty Burrell who play sexed-up beach neighbors with an eye for Blair. Their inclusion results in one of the film's most problematic moments by far. On the other end we have Paul W. Downs and his groomsmen. The juxtaposition of Jess's gathering and Paul W. Downs's rather demure stag party provides the funniest moments in the entire film. And because Downs's moments start with the unexpected and only grow more bizarre from there, the man threatens to run away with what feels like a compromised movie. Ironic since its supposed to be about the women. Look, if you really want to prime yourself for a good movie going experience, you shouldn't be asking yourself if this is the best movie they could have made with this kind of material. Instead ask yourself if this is the best movie that has been made out of this kind of material. In comparison to Stag (1996) and Very Bad Things (1998), Rough Night is clearly a winning choice. Though personally when it comes to movies about what to do with a dead body, the gold standard will always be Weekend at Bernie's (1989)."
