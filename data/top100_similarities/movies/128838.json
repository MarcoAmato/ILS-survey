            "content": "The feasting of the eyes comes to mind when realizing the polished opulence of writer-director Guillermo del Toro\u2019s Gothic supernatural production Crimson Peak. Undeniably luscious and wonderfully bizarre, Crimson Peak is a psycho-sexual thriller that resonates with the enticing visual senses and registers with the proper amount of off-kilter seduction and twisted charm. For filmmaker del Toro his unconventional narratives have always been peppered in exquisite bounciness regardless of their hit-or-miss effectiveness. In joining past del Toro genre-ridden offerings that range from the revered cult-like stimulation of Pan\u2019s Labyrinth to the misplaced but eye-popping stiffs such as Blade II and Pacific Rim it is safe to declare Crimson Peak as another elegant and gaudy candy-coated canvas of del Toro\u2019s imaginative cinematic vision.\r\n\r\nAesthetically stunning and armed with a sophisticated lining of suspense, Crimson Peak does not necessarily exude any real momentum of toxic scares or memorable chills. Still, it manages to rely on its Gothic-induced romanticism that is enough to accept this splashy and offbeat vehicle on the merits of its unique brand of animated style. Sure, there are displayed predictable paths to tap into Crimson Peak\u2019s erratic pulse and maybe del Toro and fellow co-screenwriter Matthew Robbins could have injected some more convincing bits of subversive edginess to spice up its modest creepiness. Nevertheless, one can appreciate the borrowed Hitchcockian overtones combined with the arresting set designs and peculiar ensemble. This alone invites Crimson Peak as a colorful costume drama layered in concentrated showiness.\r\n\r\nThankfully, the October release of Crimson Peak should echo the spooky spirit of Halloween appropriately and offer some seasonal sizzle for the macabre-embracing moviegoers. The story may not be startling to the point of an innovative revelation but the winning element\u2013at least one of them anyway\u2013is the exceptional art direction and production design that suitably defines del Toro\u2019s mystifying universe of nostalgic ghostly aberrations. Crimson Peak will not be confused with high-minded horror anytime soon but it does effectively promote its lush, Gothic-induced romantic vibes.\r\n\r\nBudding American novelist Edith Cushing (Mia Wasikowska, \u201cAlice in Wonderland\u201d) has one specific belief system to hang her literary hat on and the sentiment is self-explanatory: \u201cGhosts are real!\u201d. This haunting message has plagued Edith since she was a young girl growing up in Buffalo, New York in the early 1900\u2019s. Edith was an only child of privilege and an apple in the eye of her widowed wealthy father in businessman Carter Cushing (Jim Beaver). Naturally the protective parental instincts kick in as Cushing is weary of an opportunist that might wanting to court his eligible daughter Edith.\r\n\r\nEnter the seemingly shifty and broke British aristocrat Sir Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddleston). Sharpe has an agenda and it is quite clear. Apparently Sharpe wants to shop around a potential profit-making mining device and needs financial support and promotion from an influential American contact. Coincidentally, Sharpe starts a relationship with promising writer Edith whose Daddy Dearest happens to be a prominent industrialist. How convenient, huh? The skepticism about Sir Thomas Sharpe starts to mount for the concerned Carter Cushing as he stands by and regrettably witnesses his precious offspring Edith\u2019s affection for the cunning character.\r\n\r\nOf course Sharpe is not the only target that moneybags Cushing needs to worry about as the loving companion to his treasured Edith. Sharpe\u2019s older sister Lady Lucille Sharpe (Jessica Chastain, \u201cThe Martian\u201d) accompanies her sibling on his mission to do whatever he has planned for his personal gain. So now Cushing has double trouble with the mysterious brother-sister Sharpe tandem as they are embedded in the indelible psyche of the artistic Edith. However, the Sharpes have spun their web as they now have turned Edith into a member of their family as both wife and sister-in-law. Thus, a fresh existence begins for Edith Cushing Sharpe on the other side of the pond in Northern England where the Sharpes\u2019 Cumberland-based estate Allerdale Hall is located.\r\n\r\nRealistically, the less-than-stellar Allerdale Hall is not exactly the ideal venue that caters to the so-called prominence of the aristocratic Sharpes. The vast Victorian house is relentlessly drab and does not reflect the impressive homestead that it should be in status and structure. In making matters worse at Allerdale Hall Edith is restricted from stepping into certain parts of the dilapidated dwelling. Plus, Edith is overwhelmed by the recurring appearances of pesky apparitions that roam in and out of the expansive hallways of the isolated, blood-colored domicile. Lastly, the creaky goings-on is not helped a bit by the drastic change in hubby Sir Thomas\u2019s demeanor as Edith feels duped by his on-going indifference. Edith has to feel uneasy and uncertain about what she has gotten involved with concerning the grasp of the mischievous Sharpes and the life-long warnings of afterlife spirits in the decaying manse that she has been taught to take seriously since childhood.\r\n\r\nThe sinister symbolism is adequately atmospheric and the erratic pacing makes for some rather genuine, tense moments. However, Crimson Peak does show some flashes of being a slight boofest melodrama that undermines its titillating convictions. As an eerie romancer Crimson Peak feels a tad uneven. The three-way love triangle pitting Wasikowska\u2019s Edith against both Hiddleston\u2019s Sir Thomas Sharpe and Charlie Hunnan\u2019s Alan McMichael (Edith\u2019s first suitor before Sharpe\u2019s arrival) could have been explored but felt rushed and pushed aside. The whispering presence of shadowy ghostly figures floating about within the decrepit walls of Allerdale Hall makes for some convincing hair-raising hedonism that is compatible with del Toro\u2019s topsy-turvy color-toned exposition.\r\n\r\nOverall, the real scene-stealers behind Crimson Peak\u2019s brightly spry makeup belongs to the film\u2019s handlers responsible for the glossy sheen of this eye-fetching film project. Credit the sumptuous contributions in the aforementioned art design and sets (not to mention the crisp cinematography and fashionable costumes) to propel Crimson Peak\u2019s entertainment value beyond the tepid lapses in manufactured jitters.\r\n\r\nCrimson Peak (2015)\r\n\r\nUniversal Pictures\r\n\r\n1 hr. 59 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Mia Wasikowska, Tom Hiddleston, Jessica Chastain, Jim Beaver, Charlie Hunnan\r\n\r\nDirected and Co-Written by: Guillermo del Toro\r\n\r\nMPAA Rating: R\r\n\r\nGenre: Horror and Romance/Supernatural Thriller\r\n\r\nCritic\u2019s rating ** 1/2 stars (out of 4 stars)",

            "content": "> Ghosts are real, that much she knows.\r\n\r\nSeen all the Del Toro films, but this one was not any good compared to his recent year's class. The film has his signature mark, the gothic style atmosphere, visually spectacular, but the story did not strike as expected. Definitely my blame is on the writing department. Though the actors were so much better in their character exhibition, especially the lead trio.\r\n\r\nThe opening convinced it will going to be a terrifying horror. Seriously? The writer brought ghosts for a concept, but ended penning a fantasy-thriller. In the middle of the narration there was too much drama that dragged the story. And in the third act it turned totally into a killer-thriller. It should have been more frightening, they wanted it to be a faulty human nature kind of twist than supernatural things. Well, they gave what they wanted, not what we the audience looking for.\r\n\r\nI did not completely disliked the movie, I enjoyed it other than its plot. The costumes were very nice, the music well blended with the screenplay, but I was disappointed with the reason given as the motivation for all the trouble faced by character Edith. After all the hype, what it revealed was too little and too sudden with guessable stuffs. You can try it for the visuals alone than anticipating another Del Toro's masterpiece.\r\n\r\n6/10",

      "synopsis": "Set in Cumbria, England, in a crumbling mansion in a largely rural and mountainous region of northern England in the early 20th century, young author Edith Cushing (Mia Wasikowska) falls in love and marries Sir Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddleston) but then discovers that her charming new husband is not who he appears to be. His home harbors ghostly, mysterious entities and secrets, which he and his sister, Lady Lucille Sharpe (Jessica Chastain), fiercely try to hide. At the start of the film (in the year 1887) a young Edith Cushing, the daughter of self-made industrialist, Carter Cushing (Jim Beaver), is introduced. Edith's mother died of black cholera when she was a young girl and Edith has a terrifying encounter with her mother's restless spirit. Wrapping her dark, decaying fingers around young Edith's shoulder as the girl shudders in her bed trying to will away her terror, the ghost whispers a warning: \"Beware of Crimson Peak.\" 14 Years later, when Edith is a young woman living in Buffalo, New York she aspires to write about the ghosts she sees and encounters, though it is implied that her mother's is the clearest and most intimate encounter she has ever had. Instead, she is pressured into writing about romance as it is expected of her gender. Edith writes the story and it fails, though it passes the eye of a visiting aristocrat seeking funding for an invention of his own from Edith's father. The aristocrat is Sir Thomas Sharpe of Allerdale Hall, which is located atop a mine for red clay ultisol that is used in brick-making and rendering for iron ore. Being wary of aristocracy, the New York gentleman, Carter, turns away the Cumbria-born Sharpe with extreme distaste. Thomas turns his attentions to Edith and gains her affection by crediting her as a gifted writer and story-teller who doesn't merely write 'ghost stories', but rather writes stories that happen to have ghosts. Charmed by this notion, Edith begins a romance with Sir Thomas that is watched closely by her childhood friend, Dr. Alan McMichael (Charlie Hunnam). Mysteriously, Cushing is brutally killed, his skull crushed in. In the wake of his untimely death, Edith seeks solace in her romance with Sir Thomas who gently and tenderly seduces her into leaving New York for his own home in England to escape the ghosts of her past. Remembering the horror of being visited by her mother, Edith immediately agrees and sets sail for England. McMichael is wary of this arrangement and makes his own way to England later. Once at Allerdale Hall, a brilliantly clad but dilapidated mansion teetering on the red mire beneath it and crumbling under the snow and rain above, is revealed to be the Sharpe family home. Its unofficial name is Crimson Peak due to the red clay beneath it, though this is not mentioned to Edith at first, so the warning is not heeded. There, Lady Lucille Sharpe, Thomas' older sister who has already seemed cold and distant towards Edith despite her charming brother's demeanor and her apparent warmth for her brother, becomes even more cruel and controlling of Edith even denying her a copy of the keys to the rooms of the house itself. Edith is once again visited by the spirit of her mother who again wraps her fingers around Edith's shoulder and offers the same warning: \"Beware of Crimson Peak.\" Edith becomes inconsolable after visits by other ghosts begin to terrify her, but Lucille firmly insists that she stays. As Edith's inquiries about the house's and the family's histories begin to become more vocal, ghosts begin to appear all the more, beckoning her to the mines below. Despite a warning from her husband, who is awaiting the fortune of the late Carter Cushing, who is revealed to have been killed by Lucille, Edith ventures into the attic where the two siblings were holed up by their abusive mother and to the rendering vats below in the mines where she uncovers the decaying corpse of Sir Thomas's last victim. Thomas and Lucille have been using the inheritance of brides whose families lost their patriarch to fund Thomas's inventive efforts. It is revealed that the siblings conspired both to murder the holder of the fortune if necessary and then the woman herself. It is also revealed that Thomas has an incestuous relationship with his sister who seduced him at a young age and that Lucille also conspired to free them and 'never be apart' by killing their own mother who had discovered the siblings' sexual relationship. Left with the house to tend to, the two clung to their cursed surroundings and began the plots of marriage and slaying out of necessity. Sir Thomas has truly fallen in love with Edith, however, and cannot this time bring himself to do the deed. Insane with jealousy and greed, Lucille loses her calm demeanor and becomes a feral killer. McMichael arrives to take Edith back to New York only to be stabbed and wounded terribly by a knife-wielding Lucille. Realizing that his wife is in mortal danger, Thomas helps Edith escape the house and is killed by Lucille in the process, dying the better man he had always wished to be. Edith becomes enraged that the man she loved was so corrupted by Lucille and herself strikes back with an equally large butcher knife. The two women battle one another intensely with Lucille doing considerable bloody damage, but ultimately being slain by Edith herself. Leaving the corpse of Lucille, Edith returns to the house and rescues McMichael. The two escape to a nearby city while the film reveals the images of the Sharpe siblings' ghosts now residing in the home. Lucille continues to play the piano and seems to have her eyes filled with hate while the once charming Sir Thomas is steeped in sorrow and shame.",

         "I only saw this film because I am a del Toro fan--Pan's Labyrinth is my favorite movie. While Crimson Peak does not come anywhere near the quality of Labyrinth in terms of the script, it still showcases del Toro's unique skill for beauty and suspense. The sets, costumes and general atmosphere are sumptuous in that signature del Toro way. The luxurious train on the heroine's robe that audibly thumps behind her as she sweeps down the staircase? Yes, please. There is a nod to all the images our minds ever conjured while reading fairy tales. The rich colors, the music, the textures all help draw us in to this world and settle us in for the story. The film is not without its flaws. There are a few glaring plot contrivances that had me groaning. There is a superficial quality to the scenes involving Thomas Sharpe's clay mining business. I was impressed with Jessica Chastain's talent for conveying two conflicting emotions at once, all playing out on her face, reminiscent of Gillian Anderson in Bleak House.",
         "Guillermo del Toro is a director and artist whose films fall into two distinct categories: big budget English language blockbusters like \"Hellboy\" and \"Pacific Rim\" and lesser known, low budget Spanish language horror films like \"Devil's Backbone\" and \"Pan's Labyrinth\". His latest film, \"Crimson Peak\" is what happens when these two worlds collide, in other words, a big budget English language horror film. \"Crimson Peak\" is set in the late 19th century, first in New York, then in rural England. Edith Cushing (Mia Wasikowska) is a young budding writer who is intelligent, beautiful, and strong willed, refusing to allow Victorian sensibilities dictate what she can and cannot do, and as a result butts heads with those around her. Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddleston) is an English aristocrat and inventor who is in New York seeking financial backing for his mechanized clay mining business back home. When tragedy strikes, Thomas marries Edith and brings her to his home, Allerdale Hall in Cumberland, where his sister Lucille Sharpe (Jessica Chastain) is waiting. As Edith tries to fit into her new surroundings, she discovers that secrets abound and nothing is as it seems. The visuals in \"Crimson Peak\" are so glorious, they are almost overwhelming. The sets are spectacular visions of beauty and decadence in decay; costumes are intricately detailed and gorgeous; the lighting and over saturated color bring depth and meaning; the ghosts are grotesquely beautiful; and, of course, the del Toro trademarks of insects and clockwork gracefully found their way into the story as well. Because \"Crimson Peak\" is a rather large studio production, it is being marketed to a large audience. I believe this accounts for some of the lackluster reviews I have been reading. If one is not familiar with del Toro's prior Spanish language films, they may not understand his unique cinematic perspective. For some, this will mark the beginning of a journey into del Toro's fantasy world, for others it will be a disappointment. For me, it was almost everything I wanted it to be.",
         "I was getting pretty sick of those jump-scare-there's-something-lurking-in-a-dark-corner style movies like Insidious and the Conjuring. And Guillermo Del Toro must have thought the same thing because Crimson Peak is a gorgeous looking Gothic style movie with awesomely designed sets which have an incredible amount of detail to them. This adds a great dark and brooding atmosphere to the film and alleviates the need for these aforementioned jump scares. The story is well written and has great characters played by Mia Wasikowska, Tom Hiddleston and other well cast actors. Unfortunately it got only moderate critical reviews and was also somewhat ignored by the audience in favor of Goosebumps no less. Damn kids, they ruin everything! wink emoticon But it might get a second life in the video circuit as people might still discover this very enjoyable movie. Big thumbs up for me!",
         "I have just watched this movie and it was a terrible disappointment. I loved other Del Toro's movies, but this ones feels totally empty. The film is a visual feast. Gorgeous locations, wonderfully lit serve as the background for the tale. Fantastic shots and good acting would make you think that this is a good movie. But it is not. The plot is so cheap, that you can tell what is going to happen since the first frame. The evil characters are so cartoonish that you can see their next movements from miles away. The \"good\" character is so bland and pathetic that you never have a real connection with her. In fact, as you can see where the film goes from the beginning, this movie is a total bore. Do not waste your time and watch \"The Devil's Backbone\" instead.",
         "Do we need another Gothic horror from Guillermo del Toro after 'The Devil's Backbone' and 'Pan's Labyrinth'? Depending on your answer to that question, you may find yourself lapping up del Toro's latest or feeling blasé about it. Aside from the fact that there is a romance at its core, 'Crimson Peak' feels very much a mishmash of over-familiar elements from del Toro's previous films and other Victorian-era fiction, including the very well-received Showtime drama series 'Penny Dreadful'. There is a mouldering manse, an aristocratic family hiding a dark and terrible past, and last but not least a young woman who enters both family and house for the first time to discover that all is not well within its crumbling walls. Because del Toro's idea of homage to the Hammer films of the 1950s and 1960s is not by way of revisionism, his Gothic horror/ romance feels less refreshing than conventional \u2013 and that is especially true of its story. Set at the turn of the last century, it tells of the American heiress Edith Cushing (Mia Wasikowska) who aspires to be an author in the vein of Mary Shelley, much to the chagrin of her publisher as well as her self-made industrial magnate of a father (Jim Beaver). Though her father wishes for her to marry the childhood-friend- turned-handsome-optometrist Alan McMichael (Charlie Hunnam), Edith finds herself falling for the British baronet Sir Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddleston). Thomas is visiting with his older sister Lady Lucille (Jessica Chastain) to seek funding from Edith's father for his 'clay harvester', though the latter rebuffs both his invention as well as his Old World status of privilege. Del Toro, who scripted the film with veteran writer Matthew Robbins, takes his time letting Edith and Thomas fall in love with each other, but because the filmmaker is no specialist when it comes to affairs of the heart, the romance is largely stilted and bordering on cheese. It takes no less than an hour before we finally arrive at the titular haunted house, so named because the clay Thomas mines from the ground below the family property is blood-red and taints both the snow as well as the sunken floorboards. But the crimson is just one aspect of the gorgeous production design which we have come to expect no less of from the Spanish maestro; from the architecture to the stone pillars and arches to the moth-lined walls, del Toro's imagination and attention to detail is palpable in every frame. Sans two brief sequences in which Edith's late mother returns as a black wraith with an ominous warning, the rest of the haunting takes place within the creaky, creepy confines of Allerdale Hall. Maybe it is because the recent bumper crop of haunted house movies have steeled our nerves, but horror aficionados are unlikely to find the ghostly inhabitants that del Toro conjures jolting, notwithstanding his attempt to build genuine atmosphere through a mixture of quiet anticipation and sudden sound cues. Del Toro's tendencies towards the fantastical also mean that the apparitions are less terrifying than intriguing, consisting largely of skeletal ghouls drenched in some sticky red substance. Yet a more fundamental issue is the role that these supernatural entities play in the context of the story, which contrary to what you may expect, is much less substantial. Besides rousing Edith from her sleep in the middle of the night to lead her on a tour of the house's dark corridors and dank basement, these ghosts of Thomas' past are no more than sideshows to the central plot that has something to do with the sizeable family fortune Edith has been bequeathed following the sudden death of her father which Thomas and/or Lucille may have something to do with (and you probably already know the answer to that). Though it may seem at first that these spirits are trying to protect Edith, that assumption is pretty much laid to rest by the time Edith is in real peril, with the actual danger being (shall we say) more earthly. That shouldn't come as a surprise to those familiar with del Toro's works. If there is one thing we've learnt, it is that ghosts exist due to attachment to place or emotion, and while frightening in and of themselves, are really not the evil we should be afraid so; instead, what we should be afraid of is the evil which exists in the heart of man, be it greed, lust or envy, each one of which Edith comes to discover within the human companions in the haunted mansion. As admirable a philosophy that may be, it does mean that the story unfolds in largely predictable fashion, which isn't helped by a dearth of any supernatural presence in the third and final act. Indeed, there is no shaking off the feeling that there is something awfully generic about the story as well as the characters. In fact, the same can be said of most of the elements of 'Crimson Peak', which like we said at the start, seems as if it were cobbled from tropes and clichés of the Gothic horror romance genre \u2013 and the fact that del Toro has put them to more effective service in his earlier films doesn't help. The style is quintessential del Toro, lush and sumptuous in both mood and visuals, but there is something hollow about the substance within. Depending on how much you like a retread over familiar territory, you'll either love his latest or find it just a tad underwhelming.",
         "Having been a fan of Guillermo Del Toro for some time now, I had expected 'Crimson Peak' to be his next great masterpiece. Although the film didn't meet my expectations, I can't say that it disappointed them either. Near the end of the 18th century, aspiring author Edith Cushing (Wasikowska) meets a struggling inventor by the name of Thomas Sharpe (Hiddleston). The two quickly fall in love and move into Sharpe's dilapidating mansion - which is also inhabited by Thomas' sister, Lucille (Chastain). Once there, Edith slowly realizes that not everything is what it seems and decides to dig deeper, in spite of the growing dangers. First, 'Crimson Peak' is not a horror film; it is a 'gothic romance' (with some horror elements thrown into the mix). The genre hasn't been visited upon for decades, yet Del Toro does a fine job of offering his own take on it. The film also contains plenty of blood and gore - so if you don't have a stomach for that kind of stuff, your chances of finishing this film are nil (for there are far more disturbing aspects). The story constantly switches in tone. I get that its a 'gothic romance' (two genres that can't be any further apart from each other), but it can get confusing for some people very quickly. One scene might seem like it was from a romantic period film while the next might seem like something out of a thriller! I think Del Toro and Robbins did a fine job of balancing the pacing, but they could have certainly tweaked a few things and cut the runtime down by an extra ten or fifteen minutes. That being said, the plot is pretty straightforward - up until the last third of the film. Again, there are some disturbing details that both Edith and the audience discover. It took me some time to connect certain things, but I eventually figured out the bigger picture. Nevertheless, the very nature of this film will undoubtedly shock you - and will do it in a way that no other film released this year has. Both Wasikowska and Hiddleston give good performances, but Chastain is the standout. Her role as a cold-hearted, manipulative aristocrat is done with sheer excellence; you can't help but suspect of her something. She allures your attention with her mysterious persona, yet you can't help but hate her for who she truly is. Just like in any other Del Toro film, the visuals in this film are amazing. This time, instead of the visual effects (like in 'Pacific Rim'), the main focus is on the production design and costume design. Every set, prop, and article of clothing not only have their own unique design but are also very telling of a scene's or character's given mood (now that's some good attention to detail). I would honestly be shocked if this film wasn't nominated for Best Prod. Design nor Best Costume (although I also wouldn't be surprised as the Academy usually forgets about films like these). Despite its narrative problems, 'Crimson Peak' is a grand visual experience that needs to be seen on the big screen (notwithstanding the blood and gore). Del Toro's directing has not faltered one bit, and he truly has come up with an original concept that we haven't seen in a very long time. And although I didn't completely fall in love with this film, I will say I'm glad I watched it in theatres. My actual rating for this film is 7.5/10",
         "Del Toro's movie was just like Edith's book in the film. It needed more real romance, not some weird contrived romance that never felt real at all in any facet...and just missing something despite a lot of potential. So much wasted potential. I am very disappointed by this film. I was looking forward to something with Del Toro (as well as Hiddleston) for some time. While I'm not generally a fan of much horror I do tend to like Gothic romance. I feel that this story started out delivering all of that. I love the cinematography, the staging, and the costumes. Everything was gloriously detailed and lovely. I really enjoyed the amount of effort that went into the pictures as they were made. Sadly, the plot starts wonderfully and is even a bit surprising but then it falls flat and doesn't get up again. I'm not sure if parts were just a result of poor editing, or if it was planned to become dull after the trio move to England. The opening was really inviting, there was a lot of promise in the plot. Some of the hints for the future were a little obvious in my opinion but others were less so. I feel like the director must have been trying to insult people that like romance because there was incredibly little. There were a few lines that didn't feel all that romantic and instead felt a little more like bad smut novel lines. Once you get to England and the haunted house things just get weird. Half the time no one is around as Edith wanders about discovering all the murders that the siblings were up to. Edith is almost always left to her own devices while Thomas works on his red clay machine and his sister...plays the piano and I dunno...sharpens her knives? I guess they must have been off practicing the 'incest is best' mentality almost all of the time - to include the middle of the night. Why does she never ask her husband why he is never actually in bed with her? Is this for the same reason none of his marriages have been consummated without any questions? A tradition followed by law to this day. She just assumes all husbands don't want their wives? What? This was the first of many glaring issues. Why is the heroine first depicted as incredibly clever, self-reliant, and capable in the first half of the film? (Before they arrive at the crumbling manor - I now take this to be a symbol for what is about to happen to the movie.) All of these aspects sort of fall apart when she ignores all manner of clues despite previously noticing small details. When she, even though she has the money, just goes along with living in the estate at all when all logic dictates to not...yeah, well there goes a reasonably intelligent main character. Damn, we had one for the first half. Then suddenly he does have sex with her the night they're in town? Why? It was just ill-timed, forced, and awkward, not romantic. I think Del Toro just figured he'd sell the movie more if he added a bizarre Hiddleston sex scene. From the first scene with both siblings I knew they were shagging. It's not like it's a new theme for Del Toro. He's done it before. (Hellboy 2) It was overtly predictable and boring. Which leads me to believe he must have had some pretty unhealthy thoughts about his own sister. Thomas as a character felt worthless. Never was I convinced he actually loved Edith, I think he just really wanted to love her and wanted her as an escape from his abusive sister. I didn't feel bad for anyone. Thomas was a coward, that was pretty obvious and clear from the get go. Edith would have been good if she hadn't suddenly turned into a retard instead of seeking real help. The ending bothered me the most. The order of it was just all over the place. Thomas was bumbling about like the imbecile he is. He doesn't come to really mean much of anything. Edith saves herself and he just wanders in to his sister's lair. He might as well have just stabbed himself in the face and saved everyone else the trouble of his existence. His presence might have meant something if he would have walked in to declare that this wasn't okay and that he was going to let Edith go or that they'd live together or something in his crazy head BEFORE Edith had already saved herself. But since Edith had already seemingly stabbed the bitch in the heart (a lot of that pen went pretty deep) it wasn't really meaningful. That plot arrangement was just as pointless as the character, Thomas. Then crazy sister goes on a merry chase when she's been stabbed heavily near her heart. Cause you know, she wouldn't be bleeding to death or anything...evil people don't bleed, just not totally horrible ones. Then finally Edith doesn't get any real help from Thomas' ghost other than to function as the oldest trick in the book: 'hey look over there!' before she smashes in evil sister's head. Wow really? Worst ending I've seen in a long time. If at least he would have intervened before Edith saved herself then it might have had an ounce of feeling, but this was just poorly put together. So incredibly hollow, I'm sad good acting was wasted on that.",
         "This was highly anticipated film. The director didn't succeeded in fulfilling the expectations of audience and not at all film-critics. Still this picture does not belong to the category of completely useless pictures that you wouldn't enjoy. The art design including costumes, scenery, stylization, camera operating and everything made to satisfy the eye is perfectly done with detail. The topic for it's self must be the house of the Sharp family. The building has its own spirit, which the characters itself unfortunately lack. And characters is the next important thing to talk about. There is quite a top actors basis. Mia Wasikowska representing a young Victorian woman absolutely fits. Tom Hiddleston as the wanted perfect man with dark secrets is a natural choice. And finally the amazing Jessica Chastain showed a perfect performance as the evil sister. She nearly stole the whole spectacle for herself. But still it does not work very well. The main problem is that the relationship between Edith and Thomas is not believable. They lack ''chemistry''. Some converging and strongly intimate scenes are missing. The other problem is Edith Cushing herself. When arriving at the house, she suddenly changes from an intelligent emancipated woman to classic scared horror virgin type who needs a protection and loses a good deal of sympathy. The story itself is predictable, and so does not need to be focused on. Maybe the reason is that Guillermo del Torro planned to shoot this picture a long time ago and he simply lost the connection with the topic and focused on technical stuff. On the other hand, this is an opportunity to see a pure cliché, not meant in a bad way, horror- drama movie with all its attributes and great visual quality. The treatment with sounds for increasing the tension is comparable to The Woman in Black (2012). It does not deserve to be strongly criticized nor praised, but since I'm fan of all three actors and Guillermo del Toro, I must say I enjoyed it quite a lot.",
         "\"Crimson Peak\" has much to recommend it. Its cast is spot on, its costume design and set are beautiful and spooky. The story itself doesn't really go for the cheap thrills that most horror today goes for, and I appreciate that. Mia Wasikowska and Tom Hiddleston have a fantastic chemistry and you readily fall in love with the love story they present you, but the real jewel of the film is Jessica Chastain. As soon as she walks on screen you know something wicked this way comes. Her piercing glare and overall sense of distaste for the other characters really unease's you in the most fun way. You can see little to no sympathy in her face and you cannot wait to see just where she'll go with it. The story starts off as pleasantly as any period piece and you wonder what the ghouls and ghosts are up to, and whether they are in cahoots with Hiddleston and Chastain. Unfortunately by the second half, the movie looses some of its spook and becomes somewhat predictable in plot, but because of this you will be able to watch it over and over again without ever really getting bored. This is because the horror isn't the selling point of the story, the heart of the characters are. And each character has more heart than they could possibly know what to do with. The acting is superb and although this story has been told in one way or another, you still root for a positive outcome. Guillermo del Toro creates yet another masterpiece of film. I fully enjoyed it. 8/10",
         "Crimson Peak is one of the most artistic horror movies I've seen in recent times. The movie's aristocratic splendor won my heart and is one of the main highlights of the movie. All the main characters in this movie are rich and you will realize why once the movie culminates in its climax. And then there are the ghosts. Now I have to admit that I have seen \"better\" ghosts in other horror movies because the ghosts in this movie look out of shape and straight out of a child's horror story book. ( Once again if you watch the movie carefully you might actually be able to infer why the ghosts in this movie look the way they do) BUT I won't deny the fact that the movie has it's spooky moments, some of which are extremely creepy. Moments like these get a horror movie going. So watch Crimson Peak mainly for the following reasons (1) The spooky moments-- Not exactly the moments when you see the ghosts but the prologue to those moments are the ones to cherish. (2) The movie's medieval Gothic architecture and the director's eye for detail that made Crimson Peak look so beautiful-- Yes, this is a ravishingly pretty horror movie. The architecture used in this movie more than makes up for all the ugly ghosts it features. If you are aspiring to be an interior decorator and want a cathedral for a home look no more beyond Crimson Peak. 3) The aristocracy-- Like I mentioned earlier there is no dearth of opulence in this movie. The costumes are amazing and there is this exquisitely glamorous feel to this horror flick. So have a field day in the movie theater as you watch some wealthy people of the Middle Ages tackle vindictive ghosts against an immensely beautiful backdrop.",
         "Crimson is \"of a rich deep red color inclining to purple\". It's a color of passionate love, seduction, violence, danger, anger, and adventure - all of which are contained in Del Toro's latest film, Crimson Peak. Guillermo del Toro is no stranger to adding detailed elements in a film to add depth, subtle or not. In Crimson Peak, his use of color and setting accompany the characters in a dark Gothic tale of love and deceit, with a sprinkle of suspense and gore that take the viewer on an enchanting experience. Rich color tones stylize the film for a gritty and unique ambiance. Edith, the main heroine, lives in a world where everything is dull and dark. But her presence, however, is evident in subdued yellows, greens, and neutral colors as she stands out in the world she resides in. Her pale skin and light hair also attribute to the innocence that she attains. The story itself takes the viewer down a dark path, following the love between two people from two different worlds. Del Toro was smart with the balance of action and build up. For just a brief time did the story feel slow, but it later facets to the build up of later scenes. Although this film wasn't as thrilling as I tend to prefer, it did a beautiful job of telling a dark love story that held hints of violence, making it just as enjoyable. I couldn't help but feel that Del Toro paid homage to some of the classics, such as The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, Nosferatu, and even his own Pans Labyrinth and Mama with his use of transitions, shadows, symbolism, and sound. If you're looking for a film that is romantic with a dredge of somber, makes you uncomfortable yet hopeful, leaves you heartbroken but still enamored - all while being visually breathtaking, then Crimson Peak should be at the top of your list.",
         "Guillermo del Toro is that kind of superstar director that brings audiences to the seats no matter the genre of film. Much like Nolan, Spielberg, and Tarantino, Del Toro draws fans to see the next visual spectacle he brings to the screen. Make no mistake about it, Crimson Peak is an awe to see on the big screen, especially in IMAX. Unfortunately I think the marketing team hurt Del Toro's film this time around. The trailers were centered around this house and the ghosts that supposedly haunted it. While I loved the trailers for what they were, they didn't properly represent the movie as it actually is, which is most definitely a Gothic romance. The film stars Mia Wasikowska, Jessica Chastain, Tom Hiddleston, and Charlie Hunnam. We focus on Edith, played by Wasikowska as she deals with a recent family tragedy without anywhere to go and no one to stay with. Enter Hiddleston and Chastain, playing Thomas and Lucille respectively, who seem to target Edith specifically. As Thomas and Edith grow closer to each other, he brings her to his childhood house, which is conveniently miles away from the next home or any part of civilization. It also happens to have an issue with the red clay that stains the snow around the house and floods underneath during the winter. This gives the whole feel of the movie a bloody undertone. While the film isn't really a horror film, it certainly has frightening elements. Edith is constantly haunted by not only the ghosts of Crimson Peak but her mother's for whom she basing a book around. The strongest aspect of Crimson Peak is the visual spectacle you're given. Whether it's the costume design, special effects, or the sets themselves, this film is gorgeous. So there's no denying that seeing it in theaters is the way to go. The problem is that the film itself isn't all that original, and the characters aren't all that interesting. The first act is rather slow but the climax most definitely makes the film worth seeing. The performances are all great, in particular Wasikowska and Chastain, which in some way make up for the lack of character development. Go see the movie if you want to see a visual spectacle, but not if you want a horror-ghost centered film. +Visually stunning +Performances all around +Climax -Not all that scary -Starts slow 6.8/10",
         "Just for the record, i'm not a fan of horror movies. The only reason i watched Crimson Peak was the director: Guillermo Del Toro. His previous movies showed that he is a genius whose mind is filled with creativity, moreover he is able to turn his visions into reality. He has a great sense to create unique worlds and his ability to balance CGI and practical effects makes these worlds more existing. I was terrified and amazed at the same time. Visually this movie is unexceptional, i wanted to carefully examine every piece of it, but the scary theme didn't \"allow\" me to immerse deep in this visual beauty for too long. The tension was built up well and constant fear of the unknown was in the air all the time. Music was a very good \"wingman\" of the thrill and well-timed sound effects added even more to the overall experience. Many famous trademarks of Del Toro were smuggled into the events successfully. The sets, make ups, costumes looked amazing, but (for me) the most impressing was the creative use of colours. The external and internal design of the house ensured a perfect environment for the creepy atmosphere. This atmosphere was the major element that captivated me from the beginning till the end. That thrill that carried me through the movie is hard to describe. I was under the influence of fear and anxiety, so all elements were in the right place to make your heart beat faster. Tom Hiddleston and Mia Wasikowska were great, but Jessica Chastain was clearly the one who almost stole the whole show. Her character was cold, seductive, mysterious and scary at the same time. I couldn't even decide whether to love or hate her. All in all, Crimson Peak is another masterpiece of Del Toro. I recommend this movie even for those who don't like horror movies, because this is one of the few that offers much more than jump scares and unimaginative stories.",
         "I was looking forward to this movie, and was really disappointed. Here are my reasons for my 5/10 rating. 1. The acting was poor. I think Jessica Chastain was honestly the best one, and Tom Hiddleston was fine, but Mia OH MY. She felt so wooden and she just didn't give good emotion. She just really didn't seem that scared either. It was like \"oh well, I suppose I should get out of this house now.\" Charlie wasn't that great either. I'm wondering if the acting though was due to the next issue. 2. Terrible script/dialogue. Some of it just downright didn't make any sense and it was utterly cringe worthy. It was terrible delivery. Another thing that I definitely cringed at and found strange was at the house when she thought she saw someone. She was calling out for Thomas' sister and then when Thomas came in she said she saw someone. When he asked her if it was his sister, she said \"no it wasn't her.\" She couldn't even see who it was so how would she know if it was her or not? Stupid. 3. Predictable plot. I actually could have gotten past the first two gripes, but the plot pretty much ruined. I pretty much saw everything coming. Out of all of this though, I did find it touching that . In the end, so disappointing! Could have been a great movie but it wasn't. What a wasted use of potential and probably the most disappointing movie this year that I have seen. It is sad to see a movie that could have been great fall to mediocrity.",
         "I'm only guessing but it seems that movie critics are getting 1) younger and 2)less well educated than earlier generations. Certainly the hack writing in the London Evening Standard seems to qualify on both counts and reinforced my theory when she stated categorically that Crimson Peak is not based on a classic novel. Maybe not but it is definitely a rip-off of Edgar Allan Poe's The Fall Of The House Of Usher, albeit del Toro allows the house itself to remain standing but does mimic Poe's classic in featuring a crumbling mansion inhabited by a brother and sister who enjoy an incestuous relationship. Even the period is close - within sixty or seventy years of Poe - so it might have been titled The Serious Tilt Of The House of Usher. Apparently it's had mixed reviews which means more or less than a percentage of critics are happy to swallow del Toro's bulls**t.",
         "Extremely predictable movie. Literally knew what would happen in the first 15 minutes. But thought that was so obvious I'm sure it's something else. But alas no, this movie is by the book. And all the supernatural elements added absolutely nothing to the story except the running time. Every single supernatural element could have been cut from the film and the story would be unaffected. That's just bad writing in my opinion. Mia is so one note. Very boring actress to watch, but I guess Guillermo was going for the Alice character again because really it's a copy paste job here too. One minute the character is portrayed as a feminist and a thinking woman, and the next moment she's a total idiot. 'I pretend to be an independent woman because no one asked me to the ball'. Really? Chastaine is always good. Although she's showing up everywhere these days, she owns her roles so well it's not a problem. She was fun to watch, given what she had to work with. I just feel this film wasted Del Toro's talents. The movie is long, and only a few small times does it feel like it's dragging. Even realizing the weaknesses in the plot, the viewer is not in pain for putting up with it. That is credit to del Toro, who has always been a visual master. And here too he keeps us visually entertained. But that is not enough. This movie is a 6 at best. Just above average. Nothing more.",
         "What a disappointing movie. It starts promising - a few motives, characters, conflicts, sumptuous period detail (if all a little \"clean\" and theatrical if you know what I mean - everyone with perfect teeth and makeup and speaking like a thoughtful scriptwriter). Then gradually you realise that everything that is glaringly obvious and predictable IS actually what is happening - and its a long, painful process watching it play out just as you expect it to. There's nothing to make you go \"ah! That's interesting!\" whatsoever. The ghosts look incredibly CGI and therefore not scary at all, but more to the point they had absolutely no point or function - clearly just shoehorned in (perhaps after the original draft?) as a way to make it \"horror\" and more marketable to the teenage market. Jessica Chastain is always watchable, and the film looks pretty colourful, but that's about it.",
         "Guillermo Del Toro doesn't make terrifying ghost stories, instead creating beautiful masterpieces that unfold in what can only be described as dark fairy tales. From 'Pan's Labyrinth' to 'The Devil's Backbone', Del Toro has a fantasy for Gothic storytelling that is matched by no-one. Crimson Peak is no exception and from its period characters to the derelict household, everything about this film screams from an era of horror that has been iconic ever since. When brother and sister Thomas (Tom Hiddleston) and Lucille Sharpe (Jessica Chastain) arrive on US shores, they come seeking finance in a last ditch attempt for funding of Thomas' revolutionary clay mining machine. Complicating matters further is Thomas' charm with his potential investors daughter, Edith (Mia Wasikowska). Not content with an offer above any other, Thomas pursues Edith until he claims her as his wife. Upon their return to England, Edith, now Mrs Sharpe, learns of the namesake she inherits and the curse that comes with it as they arrive in the ghastly Crimson Peak is a masterpiece to behold and is rich with Gothic detail. Del Toro may have hit his commercial peak with 'Pans Labyrinth' but what he has achieved with this movie is an oil painting that is as representative of his own work as it is of his inspiration. It truly is a beauty to watch with every corner of Allerdale Hall gloriously detailed in rich history and colour, something that you wouldn't perhaps associate with a ghostly tale. With a resurgence in Victorian ghost stories in recent cinema, it's no surprise that 'Crimson\u0085' doesn't quite pack the punch it should in terms of scares and storytelling but then again, the modern classics of 'Frankenstein' and 'Dracula' that made big budget horror a box office smash, this ghost story pits itself firmly in that category of films. The trio of leading stars are sensational and their ranks in Hollywood royalty are well earned here. Wasikowska delivers a familiar turn as the frail victim and Hiddleston's charm is on show in droves but it is Chastain whose dark cynicism casts a shadow over any sign of happiness in this tale. There's something unnerving every time she appears on screen that only adds to the drama unfolding between the web of on screen relationships. Everything from the ghastly apparitions to the lead cast prove that horror can be as enchanting as it is haunting and for fans of Guillermo Del Toro's growing repertoire of films, will know what to expect from the start. Yet despite the predictable nature, it doesn't make the journey any less enjoyable. Each of the pacing hallways hosts a haunt that is creative to look at and further detail is hidden in the walls as the attention to detail mean a companion book is a must. Throughout the layers of this mansion lie secrets to behold and the bittersweet tale once again, that Del Toro is the author of the grandest of fairy tales.",
         "Not ever having seen a Gothic Horror film I went into this completely unaware of what I was letting myself in for. It's well directed, with rich, saturated colours and amazing sets. That's what takes this from being a one rated to two. The story is preposterous, the characters terrible, the usual annoying Brits-are-the-baddies casting. There is a big slice of graphic violence, claims that ghosts are real, incomprehensible behaviour from otherwise level-headed characters and an over-long running time. The film started to drag from the half hour mark and never really got going properly. There are a few jump moments, most of which are broadcast long before they arrive. All in all a tedious, bizarre film that wasted two hours of my life and £8.50 of my money.",
         "Imagine a completely humourless instalment of A Series of Unfortunate Events in which a young Count Olaf seduces Violet's dim-witted older cousin and takes her to live in his haunted red paint factory. Throw in some incest and a lot of graphic violence. Or skip seeing the movie and go straight to stabbing yourself in the eye with a fork. The plot is one long cliché - lonely young woman moons over handsome mysterious stranger, moves to isolated house where terrible secrets of the past emerge to the accompaniment of loud noises, scary music and special effects. Much blood is spilled before the heroine and her rescuer emerge slightly the worse for wear but still alive. The setting was depressing rather than eerily atmospheric. The acting was stilted and drab, the Edwardian era costuming shiningly synthetic. The special effects seemed designed primarily to showcase the amount of money and effort put into them.",
         "The plot telegraphed everything so you know what is going to happen way before it does happen. The character development seems interesting, for about twenty minutes... The supernatural parts are brief and rather pointless. The decor and costuming come off as of only mild interest and the house itself... more pathetic than anything else. The acting was stiff and rather lame. The villains come off as incompetent, not particularly menacing. There is a small element of steam punk to it that feels thrown in for no particular reason. The landscape around the house was not spooky at all, but rather dry and sterile. Del Toro seems to think throwing in a bunch of insects adds something. It does add something, which is to make you wish you were watching a Peter Greenaway movie for real, instead. A Stephen King TV mini series would beat this by a country mile. Save your money.",
         "I'm sorry to say this, but this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Nothing about it makes sense. The plot is silly, the script seems hacked together, the acting is wooden. It's not scary, it's not romantic. The FX look nice, but aren't used effectively. Same for the sets. I guess the clothes are nice. The whole movie comes across as the plot for a puzzle style video game. It was successful in giving my wife and I something talk about all night, though we had not much nice to say about it. It's really hard to pin point what went wrong when really nothing in the film works. I guess it's biggest flaw is that it's incredibly dull. I have no idea how a supernatural love story could be so dull. Before I get carried away, I must make sure I mention the one highlight. The dog. There is a papillon featured in the movie. A wonderful breed. A terrible choice for a horror movie. The dog wound up being more charismatic than the human actors. And, being such a peppy dog, it really made light of situations that I'm sure we're intended to be suspenseful.",
         "This movie is terrible. It seems like it was made for the sole purpose of being as weird and as twisted as possible. \"You know what's dark? A guy who marries women and kills them for their money.\" \"You know what's even darker? A guy who does all that because he's in an incestuous relationship with his older sister.\" You get the feeling early on that there's something strange between the brother and sister, and in the back of your mind, you're thinking, \"I really hope this doesn't end up being one of those weird brother-sister things.\" And then it does. The most original twist in the movie is that you're supposed to believe that the sister has killed not only three of the brother's wives, but also one wife's child--it turns out that the child is actually the sister's and died from being malformed and sick. Regarding the horror, this movie is not remotely scary. The visuals of the ghosts cease to be scary when the first one appears. There is so much CGI put into them that it looks overdone and super fake. Ghosts need to be done with a light touch because familiarity with monsters takes away their scariness. As for the acting, it wasn't bad but the only one worth mentioning is Jessica Chastain, who plays Lucille Sharpe. She's really good as the creepy, twisted, and perverted older sister. And as for the writing, I never believed that the characters Edith and Thomas were in love because the courtship part of the story seemed rushed. And the awkward and dry sex scene did nothing to convince me. Oh, and normal people can't bleed as much as these characters did without dying. So, is there anything good about the movie? There a few small things: 1. Wardrobe: The filmmakers wanted Edith to stand out, not only from the villains, but also from the side characters. Edith was usually seen in bright colors and has blond hair; everyone else was in dark colors and black. 2. Literary References: During the film, there are three references made to some of the best novelists of the 19th century: Jane Austin, Mary Shelley, and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Which is strange, because writing seems to take center stage early on, and is then swept aside completely in the second act. 3. Paranormal Theory: Early in the film, the character Dr. Alan McMichael (Charlie Hunnam) discusses how he believes that ghosts are tied to certain places because of stone or mineral deposits in the earth. This is an actual theory in the modern ghost hunting community, but I'm not sure if they were aware of this fact in the Victorian period. In conclusion, I cannot recommend this film to anyone. It is daytime TV tripe. Don't go see it.",
         "Excellent cinematography and costume, I was surprised this movie costs only 55m$ dollar. The whole movie is creepy but not many jump scares. However, for a romantic drama, this is scary enough. The cast is amazing, Tom H, Mia W, Jessica C all did remarkably good job. The sex scene is a little bit funny, silly to be more exact. The first part of the movie is too cheesy, but it gets more complicated and intense over time. Overall, this movie is OK. It's engrossing and interesting, I highly recommend it.",
         "There nothing wrong with the acting. There nothing wrong with the cinematography. There nothing wrong with the effects. There is everything wrong about the concept. Please don't tell me I do not understand del Toro. I understand good story telling and this is not good story telling. This could have made a good Hammer Horror revival if it didn't take itself so seriously. There is no tension and no surprises. The only horrific thing about this movie was that it got made, with a big budget behind it.! Its not the worst move I've seen but its in the top 5. I dread to think what might knock it out of the top 5! It deserves a 1 but I've given it a 2 because of a great line at the end. If it had more of those laughs it could muster being a cult movie , but quite frankly its not original enough. Crimson Peak should be renamed Crimson Weak."
