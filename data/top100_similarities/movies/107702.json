      "synopsis": "In the 1980s, a rivalry developed between two boxing champions, Henry Razor Sharpe ( Sylvester Stallone) and Billy the Kid McDonnen ( Robert De Niro). Both fought each other in only two matches, Kid winning the first match and Razor winning the second match. Before the third and tie-breaking match could occur, Razor finds out that Kid slept with his girlfriend Sally Rose ( Kim Basinger) and got her pregnant; in retaliation, he announces his retirement, to Kid's fury. Thirty years later, Razor is working in a shipyard and Kid has opened a restaurant; Kid retains a celebrity status and dreams of facing Razor one more time, but Razor has moved on and leads a simple, secluded life. One day, boxing promoter Dante Slate, Jr. ( Kevin Hart) comes to Razor with a proposition: for fifteen thousand dollars, he will do motion-capture for a boxing video game. Razor's best friend and former trainer Louis Lightning Conlon ( Alan Arkin) is in a nursing home, so Razor reluctantly takes the job to cover the nursing home bills. At the studio, Razor runs into Kid, who was also going to do motion-capture for the game; Kid provokes Razor into a fight, and the two destroy the motion-capture studio brawling with each other. Razor and Kid end up in jail, and neither of them gets paid for their video game work. However, the footage of their fight becomes an Internet sensation, and this gives Dante an idea: Grudgement Day, a final tie-breaker between Razor and Kid. Razor flatly refuses to fight Kid again, but when he discovers that he has been laid off by his shipyard (nothing personal, he was one of many) he has no choice but to accept Dante's offer. Dante launches a press conference, but as few people show interest or turn up he decides to promote the match through using lots of product placements, endorsements and public appearances by Razor and Kid at special events (particularly a mixed martial arts tournament and a skydiving event). This strategy works, mostly because most people enjoy watching the two boxers squabble and almost always fight with each other at those events. Besides this, the two boxers have to undergo training regimes that their aged bodies can barely handle. In the middle of all this, Sally Rose comes back into the lives of Razor and Kid. BJ, a football coach and Kid's son with Sally, meets Kid despite her warning him that Kid only cares about himself. At first the two don't get along, with Kid being dismissive of his son and BJ not taking it kindly; however the two slowly improve on their relationship, with BJ providing some training tips. Kid finds his trainer doesn't think he has a chance at winning, and fires him and takes BJ on as his own personal trainer; and BJ himself gets closer to Kid, even introducing him to his own son Trey ( Camden Gray), with whom Kid immediately hits it off. Meanwhile, Sally meets Razor and wishes to get back with him. Razor is unsure about reconnecting with Sally after what she did with Kid, but Lightning (reinstated as Razor's personal trainer) tells him he should accept part of the blame for Sally straying as in his youth he had been too much of a workaholic to really spend time with her. Razor meets Sally and apologizes for walking away from her, and the two reconcile. Sally herself confesses that she had only slept with Kid to get back at Razor because she had seen him with another woman; she later learnt that nothing had happened, but by then it was too late. Meanwhile, BJ entrusts Trey to Kid for dinner and a movie, but instead Kid heads to his bar and leaves Trey there while he goes to have sex with a woman in his car. Hours later, a bored Trey gets into the same car, and when he sees Kid and the woman he freaks out and starts the car moving; fortunately Kid manages to stop the car and prevent an accident, but ends up getting arrested. BJ bails Kid out, but is furious with him for having neglected his son and put his life at risk and refuses to train Kid any further. When Razor and Sally drive home, they get into a car accident. They suffer no major injuries, but a worried Lightning confirms what he had suspected: Razor is blind in one eye. Lightning and Sally keep it a secret, but convince him to withdraw from the match for his own health and safety. Upon hearing that Razor has backed out, Kid angrily tracks down Razors house and rails at him for chickening out on him again, eventually simply begging him to go through with the match as this one shot at glory is the only worthwhile thing he has in life. After long deliberation, Razor decides to fight. He meets with BJ (no issues there) and Sally, and explains that Kid made him walk away from her and boxing, his two greatest loves in life; he got her back, but he wants to box one last time. Kid meets BJ and apologizes for what happened with Trey; he presents him with a scrapbook containing pictures and articles of BJ, showing that he really did take an interest in him. BJ accepts the apology, and returns to training Kid. The time for the fight arrives, and Razor and Kid brutalize each other as the rounds go on, neither giving the other any quarter. Kid is able to secure an advantage by punching Razors blind eye, but Razor refuses to concede. Around the time of the final round, Razors face is a mess. A fearful Sally tells the truth to BJ, who passes it on to Kid and urges him to concede the match: the fight and victory Kid dreamed of mean nothing as hes fixed to win, and the best way for him to go out is as a sportsman, respectfully and gracefully. Kid refuses to relent and pummels Razor, but after knocking down Razor he has a change of heart and helps up Razor. Razor turns the fight to his favour and knocks down Kid, but also helps him up. The film ends with the two still standing at the end of the match, both having reconciled their differences (but both still dislike each other). Razor wins the tie-breaker on points, and becomes a hero who got back the girl and prize of his dreams, while Kid has let go of his own dreams in favour of a family to rely on.",

         "Like so many other people my first thought after seeing the trailer was: \"WHY are they doing it? This will be pathetic!\". Our family still went to see this movie on the opening day - and me, my wife, and the kids aged 10 and 14 all had a lot of fun watching it. Yes, it had some cheesy lines and less than perfect moments but I would never call it pathetic. I liked it so much that I registered on IMDb to write my first review. The movie actually answers the \"why\" question - and somehow this answer is the best way to describe how the film makes you feel. Yes, De Niro and Stallone fully realize that they are way past their prime and will never make anything comparable to \"Raging Bull\" or original \"Rocky\". They just do not make the drama out of it, do not take themselves too seriously and do not see the roles that made them famous as some sacred ground that can't be touched. They just want to have some fun while they are alive - and may be help others have fun as well. Not a bad way to feel about getting older!",
         "I went in hoping that I would be at least mildly entertained. Wow, was I wrong. This movie is solid entertainment with a soul. Yes there are some solid principles to live by in this movie... and some to ignore. The acting was superb. I expected Stallone and DeNiro to be somewhat burnt out. But, they portrayed vivid characters. Stallone's motivation as a character was largely a mystery until about halfway into the movie. Definitely a mirror of life today. And, it had a decent ending that was digestible. I respected their life work before. But, this movie is likely to make you a fan... or at least of the story. I did not mention the other actors. But they are all stars in this worthy story, filled with laughs, mystery, and drama. What's not to like?",
         "Sylvester Stallone must really love boxing. After returning to the Rocky films this past decade, he once again enters the ring in Grudge Match. But the smart thing here is that he's kind of poking fun at himself. Instead of trying to play a younger boxer which wouldn't be realistic anymore at his age, he plays a retired boxer who really is old this time around. The story focuses on a rivalry between two boxers who fought each other a couple of times 30 years ago, winning one fight apiece. Naturally, that situation calls for a \"rubber match\" to decide the true winner. But it never happened. Hostility remains between the two guys 3 decades later though. Stallone plays Henry \"Razor\" Sharp and Robert De Niro plays Billy \"The Kid\" McDonnen. When the two both arrive on set for a computer-simulated video game that will use their likenesses, they engage in a physical altercation which soon goes viral for all the world to see. This prompts a desire to see the two of them in the ring together once again. Kevin Hart plays the loud-mouth promoter who puts the fight on. He plays the same type of character he always plays, but still very funny nonetheless. The same goes for a funny Alan Arkin as Stallone's trainer who also plays the same type of character that he always does. So there's nothing truly unique about the movie, but it doesn't take itself too seriously and that's kind of a good thing. It focuses on the funny for the most part, but also adds some depth to the characters when it shows the struggles they're having in their personal lives. That's part of the reason they agree to do the fight... along with a genuine grudge the two still have between each other after all these years. Some of the jokes can be lame at times, but there are some good zingers here and there when seeing the two old guys poke fun at each other. And the fight at the end of the film is done well and worth waiting for.",
         "I saw Grudge Match in an early screening and I (as most of the audience) had so much fun. This is a light hearted, nostalgic film with lots of great jokes and a fantastic cast. Kevin Hart delivers, he fits just perfectly in his role. Alan Arkin steals the show in this one. He is so damn funny with his great one liners and his impressively cool acting. It is also great to see the beautiful Kim Basinger on the big screen again. De Niro and Stallone look 20 years younger than their real age when fighting in the ring, well choreographed fight scenes by the way. The physics of both Stallone and De Niro is just impressive. Most 30 year old would be more than happy to have a body like these two old-timers. There are some Rocky references in the film, and they are classy ones. I find this to be the perfect film for the Christmas Days to have a great time at the movies. It certainly is not made to please the critics, it is made to entertain the audience and create a warm, nostalgic atmosphere. And without any doubt, the film delivers! Can't wait to see it with some friends on Christmas Day...",
         "Now I am biased in two ways while writing this review. First, Stallone is my favourite actor and second, I just saw the movie so I am still within the movie magic that's making me give it 10/10. However, I doubt the next 24hrs will change anything, Grudge Match is perfect! Judge it by any standard or any angle you want, the comedy delivers, the plot is engaging and consistent, the actors are top-notch and believable in their roles and the score is spot on. The trailer only gives you a third of what you can expect and take out from this film. The movie itself is such an enjoyable experience you will not see the time go by. While there is no suspense, at no point can you criticize the movie for being predictable. The story is so well done, it will carry you through the entire 113 minutes. The very first 5mins did it for me. No non-sense, straight to the point and on your way to entertainment. Absolute jewel :D Stallone is 67 years old, and he is still the best.",
         "Grudge Match is an entirely satisfying popcorn flick that is good for just about any kind of movie-goer. The laughs are thoughtful, consistent, and sometimes enormous. There are some genuinely side-splitting moments here. And it's not just laughs; the story is sincere and emotionally driven, with excellent acting across the board to bolster it. There are essentially two story lines here in parallel to each other that occasionally intertwine so the plot stays interesting, granting the movie a little more to offer than your usual comedy. The movie had heart and if you let it, Grudge Match will win you over. I don't want to go too much into detail because I really encourage viewers to go in and check it out for themselves. Bring your low expectations if that's what you have because it certainly doesn't hurt. I just can''t believe this movie is doing so poorly in the box office, because it was in the very least a solid film with everything executed right. Go see it, and if you like it then see it again because Grudge Match deserves a much better reputation than it's getting.",
         "Grudge Match is the story of two well-aged retired boxers, who happen to hate each other for varying reasons, who get talked into fighting the rematch that was supposed to happen 30 years prior. I don't think I'm alone in saying that there were some seriously low expectations going into this one, but I must say, there are MANY redeeming qualities about this movie that made it a great watch. The first thing that stands out to me is probably the first thing on everyone's mind - Sylvester Stallone and Robert De Niro combine to be about 320 years old. Why do we want to watch them fight??? Well, the movie is completely aware of your question, and answers you with this: Because it's FUN. The movie never shies away from how old they are, and plays on it for MANY fun moments. (On Stallone's end, they make more than a couple indirect references to the Rocky movies, with great effect.) The next thing that stands out? SOLID ACTING. The cast as a whole could have easily phoned this one in, relying on name-power so sell some tickets, but everyone seemed to be all-in with their characters, and give us scene after scene of good comedic interactions. Kevin Hart gives us some great moments, Stallone and DeNiro shine when sharing scenes, Alan Arkin is a pleasure to watch, Kim Basinger is still a fox, and - I'm just going to put this out there - Jon Bernthal is a future star, and he absolutely nails his role. (And the guest appearance of the UFC's Chael Sonnen was some sweet icing on the cake...the camera loves that guy...lol) It's not all perfect - it runs a bit too long (nearly 2 hours), and it does get pretty cheesy towards the end - but Grudge Match is a fun ride overall. If you're a boxing fan, boxing-movie fan, comedy fan, or a fan of anyone in this movie, don't miss it. Grudge Match scores a 3.5 out of 5 on the BDBOS. STAY THROUGH THE CREDITS!!! There's a couple of bonus scenes you'll want to catch. ...I've got the strangest craving for some butterscotch jellybeans...lol",
         "I think people started hating this movie because people like hating. I love the performances by all the leads in this film. I love the writing, the directing, and the editing. This is not a slap-dash, make-a-quick-buck film. Unfortunately, there is one short scene, almost an insert, for what appears to be nothing more than product placement. I suspect this was added by a producer simply for the product placement opportunity. It doesn't work, has a couple of laughs, but completely yanked me out of what was a well paced movie. It took several minutes to get back into the flow and made the ending come off cheesier than it would have if they had kept me in the story. This movie will stand the test of time. I don't know why everything has to be the BEST anymore. Why can't something just be good and entertaining? This is not the best movie of the year, but it is a wonderful film with a heart. And it's FUNNY. There is a lot of variety in the humor-- some of it on the nose or slapsticky, some of it witty or even urbane. I saw the morning show on a Monday. Lightly attended, but everyone was laughing and smiling as they left. I hope there's a director's cut where that one short mistake scene is deleted (should have been saved for deleted scenes or over end credits). That correction would likely not appease critics who had their complaints about Rocky and Raging Bull ready weeks before the release, but it would help. This is a fantastic ensemble piece that is funny (very much in a Bridesmaids' kinda of way as weird as that sounds). Don't let the haters keep you from a delightful film.",
         "The movie is about Henry \"Sharp\" Razor (Sylvester Stallone) and Billy \"The Kid\" McDonnen (Robert De Niro), two boxers who were arch enemies in their prime, then Razor announcement his retirement from boxing which makes McDonnen enrage. 30 years later, the thought of a rematch is asked by the son of the two's previous promoter's son Dante Slate, Jr. (Kevin Hart). McDonnen is all for it, but Razor is not due to his own personal reason (which is said in the film). At the end though the two boxers duke it out but both go home a winner. Personally I thought the movie was amazingly entertaining. Like I said before, it is basically a Rocky Balboa film, as I said as the movie was coming out,\"It may have originally been Rocky 7.\" However the film is a comedy and it has a good amount of laughs within it. If you are a fan of sports films, boxing fan, Kevin Hart, or Sylvester Stallone fan go watch the movie. My biggest grip with the film is the amount of language. I understand that these types of characters would speak this much, and the fact that the movie is PG-13, but there really is an amount of times you can say $H!% and getting annoying/ tired some. I don't know its probably a personal thing. Overall the movie is a great watch, and I will definitely add this to my Rocky collection (even though it isn't a Rocky movie).",
         "I found this movie outstanding. I do love Rocky and Raging Bull, but this was a movie about not letting go of things that hold you back. Like grudges. This is a movie about what is important in life, like family. This is a movie about what it means to win with honor, and to stand on your feet and be a man about it. I think a lot of people were expecting this to be Raging Bull 2, or the next Rocky installment, but that's not what it's about at all. It uses those two characters to convey a different message that is important for all. I highly recommend it. On top of it all, Kevin Hart provides a great amount of humor (because he is hilarious), and Stallone and DeNiro are veteran actors who are not past their prime at all. This movie is well-cast, well-acted, and original."
