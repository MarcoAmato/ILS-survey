      "synopsis": "A young couple Aki and Kazuo are snatched off the street while having their first date as a romantic couple after a few years working in the same office, and wake up shackled in a basement, which has all its walls covered with plastic. With no further explanation, a sadistic madman degrades, tortures and mutilates them. Initially, he punctures Kazuo's belly with a screwdriver and slices his tongue, then rapes both, one at a time, forcing the other to watch. Sometimes he stops the torture to provide medical assistance and cure the couple's wounds, so they can continue alive for a long period of time. This way he cuts off all their fingers, makes collars with them, pops out Kazuo's right eye, removes the girl's nipples and cuts off her right arm. As the torture progresses, it is revealed he is simply doing it for sexual stimulation, and tells the couple he wants the two to survive. He finally castrates Kazuo, claiming he has found all the sexual relief he needs, so no longer needs the couple's \"services\". Then the couple is moved to a room which resembles a modern and clean hospital room, where the kidnapper takes care of the couple's wounds. While it is never explicitly mentioned on the movie, it becomes gradually apparent that the man has professional medical training, refined manners, taste for classical music and good wines and dressed with expensive clothes when he is not in surgeon dress torturing the couple. At some point he even mentions he is a wealthy man, which suggests he may be a reputable surgeon, not merely a violent sadist, looking for an extreme and different way to obtain satisfaction on his lonely life; however, the couple also notes the doctor has a particular rotting smell always present behind his clean and elegant appearance. After several days healing, the \"doctor\" simply tells the couple they will be free to go, he will turn himself to authorities and, as apology for all the suffering he inflicted to the couple, he will give them all his fortune which seems to be very large, as compensation. After all the horror, in a moment alone in the hospital room, Aki and Kazuo promises to support each other once they leave the place and become a formal couple. It is unclear if the madman changed his mind, or if playing with the couple's hopes to survive and being released soon was part of his mischievous plan from the beginning, but immediately after communicating to them they will be released, the next scene takes back the couple to the scary basement. After being drugged, they are shackled again, exactly as they were the first time. The \"doctor\" announces they must participate in one final test of love strength. He pulls out an extreme of Kazuo's intestines and attaches them to a hook. If Kazuo is able to cross the room to the other side (pulling off his entire intestines out of his body in the process), take a scissors and cut Aki's ropes to release her, both will be finally free. However, Kazuo fails due to blood loss and falls to the ground, agonizing (it is also revealed that the ropes restraining Aki have a metal wire running through them, rendering them impossible to cut with scissors; the task was therefore impossible). Aki begins to insult the doctor, telling him he is just the son of a whore that nobody cares about, and insists despite his refined manners and expensive clothes, he has an unusual and unbearable skunk odor, no matter how hard the tries to cover the stench. Angered, the doctor cuts off Aki's head in response and as her head falls down, it lands on the man's neck and bites him with her final breath. Kazuo on the floor, not dead yet, stabs him in the foot with the scissors as a supreme last action. The couple then dies facing each other. In the epilogue of the film, the madman is revealed to have survived what happened to him in the basement, although he cannot walk properly. He is in a quiet forest where he respectfully buries the couple next to each other in a traditional Japanese way, leaving the scissors on their tombs as a symbol. The next scene shows him back in the same car he used to kidnap the couple, covering himself with lots of perfume to hide his skunk stench while a girl is walking by, and the screen cuts to black as he goes after his next victim...

         "Just watched and only because it is banned and therefore had to seek it out and say a big ' f#@k ' u to any board who try to stop me from watching a film unless of course it involves snuff, real animal killings or kids. Anyways, the film was quite well shot and the acting for what it was - was good. All and all the production values are great. I wouldn't say gore wise this over-tops anything else that is out there especially from Japan (thinks Ichi the killer) but it is as full on as it can go. what turned me of was that the movie is very mean spirited and has no other feature than to show the torture and brutality inflicted on our two victims. The story is very basic even for a slasher with very minimal exposition. Two people are kidnapped and tortured in full on ways - that's it I didn't learn anything here nor did i come away entertained so one has to ask why was it made - who was the director thinking this would please audience wise. The film is at the very edge as far as a film can show and if that is the sole purpose then congrats to the film makers but this isn't my type of film and i doubt it would be a repeated view for many sane people out there. This is a one time watch if that and only if you are curious about it. With no real contexts, all you are left with is graphic torture after another and if that is all that entertains you when you watch a film..well....i am frankly a bit scared of you. I don't mind the occasional torture scene liking films such as Hostel, Texas Chainsaw, Inside, High Tension, Martyrs, Frontiers and the Saw franchise but for all there faults they all give you some story, breathing room between the torture scenes, production, some meaning and actually entertain. If being locked in the same room for and hour and 15 minutes while you watch the most extreme close ups of sadistic torture without anything else to it thrills you then maybe this movie is for you. I am trying to stress i am not opposed to gore, i am personally just opposed to gore alone with no other meaning besides thrilling those sickos that like this stuff and revolting everyone else - simply to revolt. That's not film-making to me. For me, there is no redeeming factors to this movie besides some production value and the debate it will create around censorship and going to far in film. Regardless of the film just being mean spirit, the film is actually just a bad film. If your curious due to it being a banned film in 2009 (i can't believe a film is banned in this day and age) or just like a bit of gore than seek it out and have a look but i don't think this is a film that many will sincerely enjoy and watch again. The only merit here may be to other film makers regarding the production value and Japanese horror theater but to the casual viewer there is nothing here for you - but it doesn't mean you shouldn't be able to watch it.",
         "When a film is deemed so heinous by the BBFC that a certificate is refused outright, fans of extreme cinema are naturally intrigued; I know that when I'm told I can't see a movie because it might possibly damage my fragile little mind, I'm all the more keen to view it, curious to see if my sensibilities (and stomach) can withstand the challenge. Fortunately, these days, where there's a will, there's usually a way, which means I am now able to fill you in on the details about this sick flick from Japan which has gotten so many censors' knickers in a twist. In a nutshell, Grotesque is director Kôji Shiraishi's reply to horror film-makers in the West, who in recent years have been claiming 'torture porn' as their own concept, when in fact, the genre was practically invented by the Japanese (can anyone say Nikkatsu? Or hows about Guinea Pig?). By ramping up the violence in his film to never-before-seen levels of nastiness, Shiraishi is basically flipping the bird to all the Eli Roth's of the world and screaming 'Follow that, if you dare!!!' The story, for want of a better word, sees a young couple, Aki and Kazuo (Tsugumi Nagasawa and Hiroaki Kawatsure), abducted by a lunatic (brilliantly played by stony-faced Shigeo Ôsako) who sexually abuses and physically tortures people in order to get his jollies: apparently, this sicko can only be sexually satisfied by observing his victims' will to survive. For starters, the psycho pushes a large nail to the back of Aki's throat (through a hole in his ball-gag!) and inserts another into his abdomen; then both Aki and Kazuo are stripped and sexually stimulated to... ahem... completion (cue lots of sticky bodily fluids). This doesn't seem to do the trick for their captor, so out comes the chainsaw, and off come the fingers (which are used to make a pretty pair of necklaces). Kazuo also gets her nipples and an arm removed as punishment for screaming out. Aki is then asked if he would die to save Kazuo and replies that he would; this results in our loony breaking out some more tools and saying the one thing no man ever wants to hear: \"first I will hammer some nails into your nuts.\" Ouch!!! A spot of nut hammering and a little penis pruning later, and it's mission accomplished for the maniac, who is so thrilled by Aki's willing sacrifice that he spares his life, nurses the pair back to health and promises to set them free. Oooh! The little liar: he has no intention of letting them go, having devised a further challenge for Aki�one which he hopes will result in an even more satisfying climax. Whilst Grotesque is admittedly little more than an excuse to show 73 minutes of amazingly harsh and realistic scenes of sadistic torture (at least until the surprisingly comical OTT finalé, which is like something straight out of a Peter Jackson style splatter-fest), it achieves its purpose with aplomb, providing a relentlessly gruelling experience for those of us who like to test our limits; you may have seen equally repellent scenes in other films, but its unlikely that you'll have seen as many in a single film.",
         "I'm a big fan of Horror and especially import Horror movies, But this wasn't my thing at all. The new wave snuff films (or rebirth of 70's uber violent films) are just not my taste... this movie is a prime example of these pointless torture movies, While in context the aspect of torture in a horror film i.e. Saw, Hellraiser, Texas chainsaw (the original) etc... works great because it's bad people getting their come up-pence or just a cautionary of the cruelty of man but this film is just a fictionalized snuff film with no story what so ever. Watching people getting brutally killed (particularly those who were just there) for the bulk of the movie then.... \"the end\" after some silly f/x does nothing for me except feeling a little dirty for watching this piece of trash. If you a fan of Devils rejects, Vacancy and the like check it out but if you are like me a little and like at least a little mental stimulation with your gore fix skip this one.",
         "For years I have watched some of the most graphic, intense, and disturbing movies that I can find. This isn't because I'm some twisted weirdo or anything, but because I'm an all-encompassing cinephile that can and has given 10 star ratings to movies from Beauty And The Beast to Antichrist. To truly love all that film has to offer, you have to understand all that film has to offer. When you watch extreme cinema, you have to know that the violence and imagery is, if used correctly, serving a purpose, which is usually to heighten your senses of pity, disgust, sympathy, repulsion, etc. Also, it's best if the film has some sort of purpose: Salo is a metaphor for how the upper-class treats and exploits those that they deem below them, Hostel is a satire on the image of the ugly American that has been experienced by other countries, and I could keep going. This brings me to this film, Grotesque. Without ruining the film (it does that on its own), I will say that there is only the slightest bit of back-story (which is lazily done and seems it might have been an afterthought), and no attempt at putting any of this within context. Bottom line: a guy abducts a couple and brutally tortures them. That's it. No point, no reason, no character development, nothing. Not only that, it's a technically flawed film as well. The cinematography is horrible: hand-held zoom-ins, overdone color filters, and an overall poor job. It doesn't help that the majority of the film is very dark and shot on digital video, so you get that annoying video blur whenever the camera moves. In terms of writing, for the most part there isn't any. When the film finally gets to a point when the characters are saying something other than \"Please stop!\" or \"Why are you doing this?!\", they act in a way that makes absolutely no sense. People that would have gone through what they went would never, ever, show the signs of acceptance or gullibility that they do. They would be hardened or almost catatonic. If that's not enough, the finale radically shifts the tone for seemingly a cheap laugh in a movie that hasn't earned or even tried to get that reaction at any time beforehand. Whenever I see someone review a film with this level of violence and knock it, even if I think it's great, I understand. These type of films are not everyone's cup of tea. When they say it was just pointless violence, however, I usually check out of the movie and assume they did the same with the movie. With Grotesque, I guarantee I never check out of the film. I stuck with it. I assumed there would eventually be a twist or revelation that would give this film a reason to exist. I assumed wrong.",
         "Gurotesuku isn't easy to watch. But today's anesthetized horror generation demand such movies. Flicks like Hostel, Saw and 'insert torture-porn flick of your choice here' have lost their original edge and this has led directors to dream up new and ever more macabre ways to shock and sicken just to stand out from the crowd. The best film I've seen that fits this 'genre' over the last few years is 'Martyrs', and while I wouldn't credit Gurotesuku as being at quite the same level it does seem to achieve something, given appropriate interpretation and invention, that many viewers seem to have missed. On the face of it this just seems to be an opportunity to torture and maim an innocent couple with very little motivation for engaging the viewer in a story or character development, but as a psychological study of the human mind it is a potentially terrifying hour and a half that, if viewed in the right way, deserves far more credit than it will inevitably get. The story summarises as thus: a couple venture out on their first date and after getting on fairly well (though it's obvious that the guy has far more affection for the girl) they are knocked-out by an unknown assailant and wake up chained to surgical-style beds where they undergo some extremely horrific torture for what turns out to be quite a legitimate reason (psychologically speaking) by the aforementioned perpetrator. The general point is that the assailant has never known love, and therefore decides to torture those who dare to experience it by finding out how far they are willing to go to protect the subject of their emotions. What follows, and in particular the 'hospital' scene, is a traumatic roller-coaster of 'would you, wouldn't you' dilemmas that could surely leave anyone who watches the movie asking how far THEY would actually go to protect a loved one. I highlight the hospital scene because it seems quite clear that the aggressor is frustrated at the fact that love could perhaps indeed lead someone to volunteer unthinkable pain onto themselves in order to protect another. And in such a situation, dangling a carrot of hope in front of them, only to whip it away again, would surely be a fitting way to break one's spirit. The fact that this transgression, and the general tone of the movie, will be missed by many is testament to the fact that American cinema has prepared viewers for a far more linear and character-based analysis than this and engaging the masses in this way will obviously; ultimately lead to a very niche-market appeal. Despite an annoyingly redundant scene at the end of the film, those who claim to appreciate this category of disturbing cinema, and who are willing (or daring enough) to immerse themselves in the sickening extremities of human nature will be disturbed, horrified and unsettled by Gurotesuku, and considering these three adjectives are arguably the most sought-after by hardcore horror aficionados, it's difficult to argue that it doesn't succeed.",
         "Grotesque (2009) *** (out of 4) Extremely graphic, depraved and vile film from Japan about teenagers Kazuo (Hiroaki Kawatsure) and Aki (Tsugumi Nagasawa) who are on their first date when they're kidnapped by a sadistic surgeon (Shigeo Osako) who takes them back to his house, ties them up and begins to torture them. As a life-long horror fan it seems every few one, two or three new movies cause a stir but when you finally get around to watching them it's clear that it was all hype and they're usually disappointing. Over the past few weeks I had heard a lot of GROTESQUE and I must say that director Koji Shiraishi has made a very brutal film that lives up to everything that has been said about it. The movie is a vile piece of trash but there's no question that it's well-made and certainly effective. I guess you could say that this is Japan's answer to American series like SAW and HOSTEL but those films don't have anything on this. The torture scenes, as you'd expect, are extremely graphic in detail so I'd say that 98% of people out there aren't going to be able to stomach them. I'm a pretty jaded horror fan and I've seen some incredibly brutal films but this here would certainly rank right near the top. The sexual violence in the film includes an incredibly humiliating situation where the girl is raped in a way that I won't ruin here but it's certainly one of the most unpleasant things you're going to see. The torture devices include a chainsaw, eye gouging and a couple scenes to the male anatomy that is going to have male viewers turning their heads like children. At just 75-minutes the film really doesn't waste any time building up a story or trying the stretch out the characters. In all honesty this is a good thing because a film like this doesn't need any boring backstory and in fact the worst thing about the movie is the one flashback introduction to the two teens. The performances by the three actors are extremely good and very believable. Both victims really make you feel the pain they're going through and Osako is so cold and chilling that he's certainly a character you'll never get out of your mind. GROTESQUE is thankfully going to appeal to very few people and it's hard to recommend except to those who want to see how far you can be pushed with violence and torture. It's hard to stomach but it's effective.",
         "Could Kôji Shiraishi be a new Takashi Miike? He's already made 4 film this year, and appears to attract controversy for the type of extreme 'splatter' movies he makes. Most notorious at the moment is this little slice of horror entitled 'Grotesque'. The BBFC have already banned it, but that doesn't really mean anything anymore does it? Does it? Or does it?? What Kôji Shiraishi appears to be doing here is attempting to outdo Eli Roth's dreadful 'Hostel' movies. A sort of 'who can make the grisliest horror movie' trip. Well, he certainly succeeds in terms of outright horror, and includes scenes that American film-makers won't go near... specifically a scene which includes sexual assault. Note that, as I write, this movie is not available outside of Japan, and the DVD has no subtitles, so It's possible I've missed some intricate subtleties of the plot. Oh no, wait! There isn't one HAH HAHAHAHA! Ahem. So, what's the rumpus? A serial killer kidnaps a young couple and ties them up and tortures them. That's the story, well, more of a basis for torture to be honest. The film includes scenes of Nihon nipple-sucking (and nipple cutting), chainsaw choppiness (or rather choppenis), testicle-nailing, vicious stabbings and gut-spilling goading. The effects are okay ,sometimes laughable, and the ending is hilarious. Tongue firmly in cheek, Mr Shiraishi? It's a pity I didn't understand the dialogue, the girl (AV actress Nagasawa Tsugumi) has a final speech which is obviously crucial, and could go some way to justifying the violence. Or could it? Anyway, it's bad, but not that bad.The horror isn't very cringe-worthy, (where as some of the effects are), and it certainly doesn't justify being banned. For what it's worth (duration is 1hour 13mins), I believe someone should give it a decent DVD release in the future (in Holland, definitely). If you're a fan of horror, you should see it. It you work for the BBFC, you should sleep with it. Well worth a watch.",
         "This horror movie is not a movie for the faint hearted ones. You probably do not want to watch this one if you have eaten something. If you like hard core horror, definitely watch this one. The best one I've seen in a long time. It tries to reach the border on how far one will go to save a life, and then crosses it. It is about torture, mentally and physically. All to satisfy a deranged men to get his kick. The film is made in such a way that you feel sorry for the people involved, and it feels like you are the one who is suffering it all. Nearing the end of the movie you get an idea why this is all happening, though the reason does not satisfy me. Next to this one, SAW is child splay. The movie lives up to its name. Don't wake up screaming the next morning...",
         "I wanted to see \"Grotesque\" because BBFC banned this Japanese torture extravaganza in UK.BBFC director David Cooke described the film as containing \"unacceptable content\" and being \"little more than an unrelenting and escalating scenario of humiliation,brutality and sadism\". He said that cuts were \"not a viable option\".The film's director and screenwriter Koji Shiraishi responded that he was \"delighted and flattered by this most expected reaction from the faraway country,since the film is an honest conscientious work,made sure to upset the so-called moralists\".A young couple Aki and Kazuo are kidnapped by sadistic madman and sadistically tortured and mutilated in his basement.For example our torturer cuts off all their fingers with a chainsaw,makes collars with them,pops out Kazuo's right eye,cuts off girl's nipples with scissors,cuts off her right arm and castrates Kazuo.He is doing all this cruelty galore for sexual kicks.He is actually trying to measure the strength of his victims love.The finale of \"Grotesque\" is extremely gory and silly at the same time.Still I sort of enjoyed this modern piece of depraved filth.8 out of 10.",
         "Well, its now been banned in the UK as of a few days ago. And as with the legendary British Board Of Film Censors onslaught on horror movies in 1984, this will of course make it a much more sought after movie now than if they'd left it well alone. Its 2009 today, and most folks with minor internet savvy will quite easily be able to obtain a perfect copy for a fee (or for free) as opposed to the under-the-counter, grainy bootlegs of years long past. So Englands banning of any movie these days has little effect on those that really want to see it anyway. Now on to the movie itself... For anyone to say they \"enjoyed\" this film Id have to ask them a few questions about their mindset. Don't get me wrong, I definitely don't think it should have been given a UK ban, but its really not something you'd want to sit down to with some popcorn and a quiet night in with your partner. For all its hype however, (and I was taken with some apprehension before I watched it), parts of it aren't as bad as you might expect. For example, the eye gouging scene is much less shocking (IMO) than Dalis \"Un Chien Andalou\" which was made 80 years ago in 1929. This is mainly because the camera doesn't actually let you see what happens - just the aftermath (even thats not so bad). Other things like the sexual assault finish off (excuse the pun) with something that a bawdy anime cartoon would be proud of - liquid overkill in the extreme lol. Not to mention, that even though there's graphic violence all over the screen, the victimiser only lifts the female victims top up, not her skirt, and I asked myself could this be because of Japans aversion to pubic hair? Other things just don't make a lot of sense either (no I don't mean the plot) for example: if this kind of torture was dealt out on any human being (I would imagine) they'd either bleed to death long before these sorry pair passed away, or their reactions to the violence would have been much more extreme. And the females end made me laugh out loud - no, really, I mean literally (wait for that one). The main part of the film then fades into both the couples lives ebbing away to the tune of \"Land of Hope and Glory\" - and I couldn't help but have another chuckle at this. So, is it worth seeing? Id probably say yes. But heres how you approach it: Imagine you're a special effects judge, and take the \"movie\" as a collection of special effects you want to review. Then, give your mark for the quality of each scene within. Thats how I saw the film. Not as a story of any value (as it doesn't really have any plot) but as a vehicle for showing what a good effects team can achieve with a few pounds of latex and a bucket of fake blood. And Id certainly like to see a \"Making Of\" documentary to learn how they did some of the scenes within. But in the meantime, Im sure over the last few days (and in more to come), Google will have quite a lot of UK users searching: \"Grotesque\" to see what all the fuss is about. Such is the enquiring human nature when you ban something."
