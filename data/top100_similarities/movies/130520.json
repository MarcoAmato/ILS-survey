         "content": "> A little girl and her unexpected adventure with an unlikely friend.\r\n\r\nIt was a good movie, but just like 'Turbo', it was turned down by the critics and so those who follow them. Besides Disney and Pixar, DreamWorks Animation ain't that bad at all. Technical side of this film comes under same league with the other two top production house, but the story and the character are not strong enough. Comedies were awesome, and so the dialogues, the innovation in narration falls short with the same old cliche in the alien theme. The soundtracks were good though, especially that one used for the promotion, 'feel the light'.\r\n\r\nFor a change, the lead girl character was different and voice rendered by Rihanna. I said it many times that my first ever 3D animation was 'Ants', despite 'Toy Story' was the first feature length. And this film has been the best work of the director to till date since his first flick 'Antz'. As usual like any animated movie, it was targeted for children, but I enjoyed watching it. There won't be a sequel at least for now, but I would love to have one. For a change you can try this to get a break from the fairytales and princess stories.\r\n\r\n6.5/10",

      "synopsis": "The alien race known as the Boov are very good at one thing - running away. On the run from their enemy, the Gorg, the Boov have found a new planet to call home - Earth. Led by Captain Smek (voice of Steve Martin), they commence their friendly invasion of the planet, relocating the humans to other parts of the planet while the Boov inhabit their homes. One of the Boov, Oh (voice of Jim Parsons), is a more excited, free-thinking member of the species. He invites all the other Boov to his apartment for a housewarming party. None of the Boov show up, and Oh is left feeling lonely. Not far from Oh is a teenage girl named Tip (voice of Rihanna). Her mother Lucy (voice of Jennifer Lopez) was separated from her during the invasion, leaving Tip with her pet cat Pig and fueling her hatred for the Boov. One Boov enters Tip's home, leaving her no choice but to make a run for it. She takes her car and decides to take it upon herself to find her mother. Oh runs into the street to find a Boov cop named Kyle (voice of Matt L. Jones), who, like the rest of the Boov, are annoyed with Oh. He invites him to the party, and then decides to send a mass invite to every Boov on Earth. Oh hits \"reply all\", which goes to EVERYBODY in the galaxy, including the Gorg. The Boov panic and declare Oh a fugitive. The little alien just barely manages to escape. He runs into a convenience store to grab stuff, just as Tip and Pig are doing. Tip runs into Oh and shoves him into the fridge, trapping him with a broom. She decides to leave him there, until her car fails to start. Oh offers to fix it, so Tip reluctantly lets him out. He turns it into a hovercar that runs on slushies. Oh hitches a ride with Tip when he promises to help her find her mother, but they have to go to Paris to find the Boov Command Center and locate her through that. Smek summons the smartest Boov to come up with a solution to stop Oh's invitation from reaching the Gorg in less than 30 hours. After a few bad suggestions, one of the smart Boov starts to say they can delete the invitation, until Smek takes credit for that plan. The Boov are shocked to find that they can't log into Oh's email because his password is unique, unlike everyone else's (it's \"password\"). Smek sends Kyle to find Oh and arrest him. Tip and Oh stop at a gas station. Oh tries to reroute the GPS on the car to take him to Antarctica to get away from every Boov in sight. Kyle shows up and tries to arrest Oh, when Tip comes back and knocks some boxes over him. She shoves Oh around when she realizes he tried to ditch her and back out on his promise. She straps him to the passenger's seat and flies the car herself, evading Kyle and making it over the ocean. During the ride, Tip introduces Oh to her favorite music. He begins to feel an involuntary sense to dance. This gets so intense for him that he has to jump into the ocean to cool his core. Tip waits worriedly for hours until Oh reemerges. She chastises him to scaring her. Oh learns that Tip already feels lonely like him without her mom. The two decide to work together and they open up to each other on the rest of the trip. They make it to Paris and locate the Boov Command Center, which is in the now-floating Eiffel Tower. While the smart Boov continue to try and find a way to break into Oh's password, Oh gets in himself and deletes the message seconds before it reaches the Gorg. He then plugs in Tip's brain to help him get an idea of where to find Lucy. They trace her location to Australia, where she is actively looking for her daughter. Tip hugs Oh for this. The other Boov then find the two and try to \"erase\" Oh. Tip messes with the gravity manipulation system and causes the whole Tower base to tilt upside down. She and Oh find the car and head for Australia. When the two wake up, they see other Boov riding by them in fear. A Gorg ship is close behind them. Tip and Oh manage to knock it down, but in the process lose their slushie fuel. Oh figures he can repair the car with some Gorg technology from the fallen Gorg ship. They come across it and see that it's actually a drone. Oh recovers a special chip and uses it to get the car up and running. Tip and Oh make it to Australia and see the Boov evacuating to their mothership. When they land the car, Tip starts to run for her mother, but Oh tries pulling her toward the mothership for safety. Oh claims that Lucy is on the ship, but Tip knows he's lying. She gets angry at him for trying to break the promise again, and she declares that they were never friends. Heartbroken, Oh returns to the ship. The Gorg come close to the Boov ship as they flee in terror. Oh pulls out the Gorg chip and uses it to fly the ship further away from the Gorg. The Boov become astonished at Oh's plan. Smek becomes upset and reminds everyone that he's the captain. Oh defies him and says he's a bad one since everything he told them about humans was a lie. Smek orders he be erased, until Kyle steps in and defends Oh. He grabs Smek's \"shusher\" (a scepter thing with a rock on it) and gives it to Oh, stating that he should be the new captain. Although uncertain at first, Oh knows what he has to do first. Tip goes everywhere she can to find Lucy, but nobody can help her. Defeated, she sits in a corner and cries. Oh returns to her side and helps her track down Lucy. The mother and daughter finally reunite and thank Oh. The Gorg mothership then descends upon the planet. Oh realizes that they want the rock on the shusher, since Smek stole it from them before. Oh runs to the ship to try and get it's attention, locking Tip and Lucy in the car to avoid them getting in trouble. Tip breaks out of the car and shines a light in the Gorg's face to bring his attention to Oh as he holds the rock up. The Gorg halts the ship as it mows down the ground, with Oh in its path. Tip rushes to rescue him, but it appears that Oh gets crushed beneath the machine. It starts to pull back, and Oh is unharmed. Tip and Lucy run to Oh and hug him. The Gorg emerges from the ship, and Oh returns him the rock. The Gorg emerges from its armor to show that it's a harmless starfish-type creature. Inside the rock are the next generation of Gorg, as this Gorg is the last of his kind. He thanks Oh and departs. Oh becomes a hero to both humans and Boov. Oh finally gets to have his party at his apartment, with humans and Boov in attendance. Tip plays her music and gets the rest of the Boov to experience dancing for the first time. We then see that other Boov, including Smek, are partying on the moon, while other ships from other planets head to Earth for Oh's party.",

         "Assalum Alaykum. This is a great animation,adventure and comedy movie. I am not surprised it is number 1 in most countries around the world. Escaping from their enemy the Gorgs, the Boov have found a new planet to call home, Earth. Guided by Captain Smek (Steve Martin), they start their friendly invasion of the planet, relocating the humans to other parts of the planet while the Boov inhabit their homes. In this movie the series of incidents are great from the beginning to the very end and believe me all the scenes are wonderful,the adventure is pleasing and the comedy is totally entertaining. The lovely surprise is that the great singer Rihanna acts in it.",
         "Took my 8-year-old girls. It was cute. They enjoyed it well enough. But on the car ride home, when I asked about their favorite part, the best they could come up with was the cow joke (I won't repeat it). After all the great animated kid's movies of the last 10 years (Nemo, Shrek, Cars, Frozen, etc), this one is completely forgettable. In a month or two, my girls won't even remember it. Can't imagine they'll ever ask to get a DVD or watch it at home. I'm not sorry I took them, nor was it a waste of money. But we are so spoiled by such great animated movies that a mediocre one like this becomes disappointing.",
         "I'm 30 years old, but I still enjoy watching animation films very much. As I heard that there was coming a movie with Jim Parsons & Steve Martin I knew I had to see it - specially when it was a film from Dreamworks. From seeing the trailer I already knew I didn't like the animation style too much, but I didn't let that bother me watching the movie. Sadly, B class style was one of the lesser flaws of the film. Jokes are outdated, movie is full of bubblegum pop music, the characters are far from interesting and you can't really build a connection to them. Also, the plot... oh phew. Way too easy. I mean, in most cases of animation films the plot is more or less predictable - after all, we're talking about western animations. They have a prodigy, who doesn't fit in, misses his/her parents and gets a happy ending. But Home just made my jaws sore from yawning. It wasn't _all_ bad, I'm sure that many kids will enjoy this, but for me this was one of Dreamworks' biggest flops. The only actual fun I had thinking about Jim Parsons and how literally every one of his lines could've been said in The Big Bang Theory.",
         "As a fan of animated films and Jim Parsons, Home felt like something I would enjoy. When the first Rihanna song started playing, I grew skeptical. When the next one started, I got tired of it. There's actually 5 Rihanna songs in the film. 5. Five. Along with Rihanna playing one of the lead roles. And I should mention that her character is not singing these songs. She's just listening and dancing to Rihanna. Sorry, but nope. Home started feeling like a commercial for some Rihanna album or a very long music video. I don't think I will remember this film, but if I do it would be for exactly that, and I would forget the story. However, if you're not like me and don't care about such things, the movie itself is pretty cute.",
         "I had not really high expectations on an animated movie, my son would probably enjoy something like this way more than me I thought. Huge Fail. The movie was from the beginning great and not only for kids. It is a feel-good movie for all ages. It is about family , friendship and that being different or just being yourself is not a bad thing at all. I found the movie throughout entertaining and very often funny. The Boov's are just too funny in particular Steve Martin as the voice of Captain Smek, whose firm leadership of the Boov people is undermined by his ridiculous fascination with human artifacts such as bubble wrap . He reminded me partially on King Julien from the Penguins of Madagascar. But even if you are not touched by the great story you will certainly love the Soundtrack. The whole movie was perfectly set and is for me the best Dreamworks movie since a long time. Take your kids and watch it on the big screen, they will love it! and you too, guaranteed. Verdict: A great story meets perfect cast and nothing can go wrong on this alien/ human road trip movie.",
         "I saw this movie today with the kiddies. I would say it is a really solid movie. It is the story of an unlikely friendship that forms when an outcast alien meets a sassy little girl on a mission to find her mom. I think the story is well thought out and there are many hidden life \"gems\" noted within. The theme of judging others sticks out as well as themes of \"being yourself\" and learning from your mistakes. It is a little predictable but I think all adults feel that way about children's movies. The acting was good and surprisingly Rihanna did very good (I had my doubts about that). The kids loved it and laughed a lot. They also enjoyed the music a lot and that is really what it is all about. I would recommend it for families.",
         "This is not the kind of movie that will stay with you forever. I have seen better animated movies in the past. BUT it's a movie that you will definitely have a good time watching, laughing and laughing again. I loved the way this little alien was depicted, using Jim Parsons' ticks and facial expressions! The concept of the aliens taking different colors based on their mood was just to die for! The story was OK and the time it lasted was sufficient (I always root for longer movies instead of shorter). Overall, it was a cute cute movie in the end! We laughed a lot, and although we are genre-fanatics (being in our 30s watching these movies without kids), I think that the average movie fan will also like it. It was time well-spent on a movie and I sincerely recommend it!",
         "There are several lingering messages that HOME intends to deliver, and the speakers are aimed toward the younger ears: conquer your fears, be yourself, and as the soundtrack says \"Feel the light\" and bring it all back, pertaining to the lost glory waiting to be reclaimed, and the HOME they eventually, should be going back to. It will be difficult to dismiss HOME's charm, specifically the colorful bubbly aliens called Boov, and equally endearing human characters, most of which voiced by popular actors like Jim Parsons, Rihanna and Jennifer Lopez. However, I'll be frank�there's really nothing else so special about the movie. The plot is generic, I mean we've seen these alien-invades-earth, extraterrestrial befriends-human formula, over and over again, and it's kind of tiring already. I almost don't care about the plot anymore. Worse, in HOME, the humour didn't feel natural, either. I had these many moments when I needed to pause and ask myself \"was that supposed to be funny?\" while realizing the confused laughter gathering volume around me inside the theater. I just find everything the writers seemingly thought to be funny, aren't really as funny as they seem to imply. HOME is a colorful movie, I mean literally colorful, and you may find some of the characters lovable, but that's all. In general, HOME is a generic movie with flawed storyline, just another version of what we've already seen from its genre, only forced and unnatural and yields a mostly unpleasant outcome, bereft of contagious humor it utterly needs to overshadow its overly familiar material.If it's any consolation, the movie has beaufiful soundtrack. Anyway, you wouldn't blame the kids for finding this wonderful movie, it's for them after all. And this will serve as a reminder about how they should be and should act like while growing up.",
         "Did Rihanna pay for this movie? I'm pretty sure she must have... This is by far the worst Dreamworks movie I've ever seen. Terrible jokes, laim story... suited most definitely to 5 year olds and that's the only reason I gave it a 2 rather than a 1... From song to song this movie seems like an attempt to brainwash young children into enjoying Rihanna's (or J Lo's) sterile pop songs than to actually enjoy an animated movie, so if you like animation but already ride a bike with your training wheels off, you probably know better ways to spend 90 minutes of your life.... If you like Rihanna and J Lo or just like to watch multicolored cgi movies just for the sake of it, you might like \"Home\". If not, for goodness sake, please avoid watching this...",
         "This was one of those kids movies that moved along at an entertaining pace and kept the adults interested as well. The humor is generally light but consistent and the soundtrack to this film was actually pretty cool too (Rihanna and Jennifer Lopez, providing voices to two of the characters, sing some of the danceable tunes on the soundtrack). Jim Parsons is great as Oh, the misfit alien who just wants to make friends but comes up short in the ranks of his regimented, antisocial species. Steve Martin also lends his voice as the hilarious but clueless leader of Oh's people, who decide Earth looks like a nice place to live, despite the little fact that it already has a native population (us). The forced relocation of the human population to \"happy human towns\" results in Tip (Rihanna) going on a quest to find her lost mom (Lopez) is the gist of this sweetly funny movie and it's worth seeing, kids and adults alike."
