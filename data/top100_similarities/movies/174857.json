         "1 glass of wine in and I decided to give this one a go. Before I go any further I have to admit that I suffer from a fear of underwater drains. Anything man made underwater actually.. drains, lights, windows.. they all give me the heebie jeebie's. I have been this way as long as I can remember and I can no longer swim in pools. Google it, it isn't just me. I'm not sure why this movie is getting so much hate. I totally enjoyed it. For a movie that had to be carried by only 2 actors and had only one setting it was done really well. It was also a very original idea and that is always something that I am looking for. The acting was great and I thought that the characters acted exactly as they should. I read all of the reviews before watching and I don't agree with any of them. This isn't the most awesome thing this year and it isn't the worst. If you are looking for a big budget, action packed movie this isn't for you. If you want a slow burn thriller then give it a go.",
         "First off this movie is more of a dramatic thriller than a tension filled scare fest so if you have ADHD or need something exciting happening every 5 seconds than move on. I feel like people saw the name TOBIN BELL and are expecting a SAW ripoff. Second, I have a sister myself and the way the relationship unravels and develops between them felt honest and truthful. I won't lie I really cried at the cathartic moment between them in the end. If you're claustrophobic or get anxious in tight spaces I could see it dragging a bit but it felt like I was seriously holding my breath for the moments under water. The story just worked for me on so many levels, I love how the Clara character wasn't just some one note evil-villain and you learned a bit about her past. Seems like she lost her own daughter at some point and had her own demons. The performance of the actress really helped me sympathize with her. The two girls were also multi-dimensional, going from bratty to frustrated and then defeated all in one scene. The near suicide had me in tears... I'll be watching this again to pick up all the little moments I missed. Definitely worth a 7 or 8 in my book! NOTE: And in case you do make it to the end, that was a glucagon pen and not insulin which apparently a ton of people missed.",
         "The story is set and shot entirely at a public pool. Two sisters, Joanna and Bree are swimming in the pool when, as it is closing, one sister has to dive back in to retrieve her lost Engagement ring. As she does this, the pool's manager looks, but does not see the girls as the second sister jumps in after the first to help her look for it. At this time, he closes the fiber glass top trapping them in for a long holiday weekend. To make matters worse, there is a sadistic employee who is a parolee and gets caught trying to steal early in the film and gets fired. She is ordered to empty the waste baskets and finish out her day and not come back. The woman does come back hours after closing to discover the trapped girls but won't help. There is a lot of underlying issues between the sisters, as well as the woman who not only will not help them escape, but taunts them as she is clearly scorned and injured herself. I won't divulge anymore but will say I felt I gave this a generous 7 of 10 but feel it was mostly deserved. There is a lot of tension and frustration throughout and scenes that make you want to jump up and scream at the antagonist. Acting is well done and believable in a Simple setting. A definite watch for any fan of light thrillers and time not wasted.",
         "A nice low-budget movie. Two girls get stuck under a pool cover over the holiday weekend and need to get out before they die from starvation. The movie is 81 minutes long, and while this may sound long for such a simple movie with 2 main characters and one setting, it is surprisingly entertaining with a lot of tension and I hardly ever felt the need to fast-forward. Also this is a very original idea for a story that while sounding a little bit ridiculous does catch your attention and make you want to watch. A little bit into the movie a sadistic employee who was arrested in the past enters the place trying to steal things but notices the girls stuck under the cover. The girls try to get the employee to open it but she is more interested in the belongings they left outside the pool. Watching the three interact as the girls try to convince the employee to open the cover will put you through swings of tension, anger, and sadness. And the three main characters don't feel one-dimensional, you will actually care and show emotions towards each one. It's a nice, fun little movie overall. It's a little bit slow at the beginning, there are a couple of flaws (you never know how long the girls stay in there, the water is supposed to get colder as the movie goes on but towards the end they suddenly don't notice it anymore), and the ending makes you wonder why it took so long to use that method to finally get out, but those are the only negatives and they don't harm the entertainment value too much. Would recommend.",
         "A very interesting and original little thriller. I definitely was pulled in by the acting and the tension. Was following the sister's journey and hoping they find a way out. It makes good use of the limited set, the pool and the small gap of air between the surface and the pool cover provide plenty of chilling close-ups of the women's failing faces as they come to grips with their surreal reality. Estranged already, we learn of a bitterness between them stemming from years of opposing paths begun by a tragedy in their youth that haunts them to this day The muted blue tones of the pool help keep some desperation and the dialogue, which is crucial since there is\u2013by extension of the premise\u2013nearly no action, is mostly compelling, though the entire setup edges a little too close to metaphorical.",
         "Two sisters-with issues- get trapped in a swimming pool and are desperate to escape otherwise they will die. The film is a tense, thoughtful drama showing that a brilliantly acted suspense movie is just as good and maybe better than many big budget pictures. This movie is dramatic and intelligent examining through the play morality matters such as revenge, mortality and forgiveness ; it had me engrossed throughout, hence 7 and a half rounded up: 8/10.",
         "I loved this movie. It was one of the most dramatic films I have ever watched. When I first saw the premise \"trapped in a swimming pool\" I thought wow, really how they can fit a 1and a half hour film in a location like that, without even any sharks. I thought it would be another disappointing survival film, but boy, was I wrong. I was pleasantly surprised by this film due to most of the thrillers being shot in the water a disappointment. But this film was chilling to the bone. And it does without any sharks or crocodiles and without almost no gore. The two actresses were brilliant, their acting was top notch. I felt their pain, frustration and agony throughout the whole film. The last scene was absolutely brilliant where the younger sisters uses all her strength to get the grate loose from the drain. The music was top notch to give value to that scene and the strength she used. I can see how some users got irritated by their bickering in the beginning. But think, what would you expect in a situation like this where they have both been through so much and are meeting up after a while. Clearly there were a lot of underlying issues between the sisters that came to surface. But it gradually got to the point where they became very close sisters, and you saw how this experience really bonded them as sisters. It's not like they argued the whole film and came out hating each other. Their relationship was one of the key themes of this movie, and how their relationship transformed was inspiring Now of course this is not your typical big budget action packed shark movie, but I loved this film from beginning to end. It has great message regarding strength, never giving up and the power of sisterhood. And they both made it out alive in the end which was a testament of their strength. The villain is also interesting because she's not your typical villain who has no heart or compassion. She also develops as a character and we can see she's had her own fair of issues as much as the other 2 characters. Overall, a great film, a must see for any survival thrillers. In all the survival thrillers I have watched, I have never seen such will and determination from the characters. It just goes you don't need a shark or a croc to make a movie as great as this. I was very surprised that something as basic as this could be this good.",
         "OK, so most of this film is shot under a pool cover at a public pool. Apparently, the pool guy forgot to check the pool before pressing the button that shuts the cover - trapping the main characters of the film under the cover. The weight of the entire film is placed on the 2 lead actresses who by mistake are now stuck in the pool with the cover closed on a holiday weekend with no way to get out. Sounds like a film that could be good, right? Wrong. I don't see this costing more than $5k to make the entire film. I'm not against low budget films, but it has the feel like it could have been filmed by an amateur. The entire film is claustrophobic, boring and drags on forever. It has the feel like it could have been shot in a couple days using one or two GoPro cameras at any neighbor pool... In any event, 90 minutes later the film offers very little but a predictable ending. Barely watchable...",
         "Like most trapped thrillers it is all about what drama you can get with the barest of bones. In that sense, 12 FEET is solid, well crafted minimalist film making and a heart wrenching movie experience to boot. It is gripping, moving, frustrating, and if you're claustrophobic then it's terrifying too. Oh yeah, and it all takes place inside a swimming pool. Two sisters visit a public pool the eve before a long holiday weekend. One loses her engagement ring in the pool so both swim down for it. Unaware the sisters are still under the water, the manager closes the fiberglass covering, trapping the sisters underneath. The movie limits itself to an astounding extent, but makes the most out of what it has, creating an incredible experience. How much can you really expect from a movie that takes place in a pool with only two people? The story delivers a lot more than you would expect from this scenario. It has all the right elements to make it as enthralling with very little action or vfx. To start off, the director Eskandari does a great job directing his limited space. He miraculously pulls off a lot of great shots and brilliant claustrophobic nuances. He directs with enough skill to keep the movie interesting in its entirety. The story never felt lagged or drawn out and every moment where it would have slowed down it would throw a great twist or shocking character revelation that drew you right back in. While the visual directing gives the film plenty of life, Alexandra Park and NJ No one's stalwart performances really drive the heavy emotions of the film. They deliver top notch performances, that carry the film's narrative and are both truthful and harrowing. I really felt for these two sisters. This isn't a groundbreaking thriller but sometimes it is nice to witness how effective cinema can be with so little. During the finale you will want nothing more than to know the fate of these two sisters, and when you finally do learn it, it is unexpected but satisfying.",
         "Saw a trailer for this last month on YouTube, it's one of those Films which is little known, but somehow a trailer pops up on your recommendations list. But yeah, seen a trailer for this & thought it looked good! Though I'd have to say, my first fear was thinking it was going to be a boring Open Water/Blair Witch type film. Because for an 81 minutes, 2 sisters getting trapped in an Olympic sized swimming pool, under fiber glass cover, doesn't justify the run time. So that's what I thought. But there is \"problems\" thrown in, so it isn't like them films (spoiler alert). After seeing this film, I'd say it was a pretty decent watch. It had some sinister moments in it & had a good twist of a story to it as well. I also found the film to be somewhat like saw in a way with the whole appreciate what you have sort of thing thrown in. There is a little bit of blood & gore here & there, but not a lot. The film is mostly about the relationship of the sisters trapped under the pool cover, how they get out & trying to find a way to escape while the psycho b!tch janitor (who believe it or not has a criminal past which she can't seem to shake) torments the girls in exchange for cash & other valuables. It was better than what I thought it would be, but it isn't entirely amazing, as in a pool, a contained area, there's not a lot of \"problems\" that could occur, in an ocean, definitely, but pool, nah. One of the sisters is diabetic, while the other has a date with her fiancé to be who has left her call after call. So yeah, there's that & a few of the other things that the b!tch janitor done to torment the sisters. So it does have some action in it to justify it's 81 minute run time. I also have to mention that the \"Based off True events\" tagline was mostly true, with evidence provided from the Director/Writer that this incident & others have happen, as well as the concept in itself being off a fear the Director/Writer had with being stuck/trapped in open water! I liked the fact that Tobin Bell played a small role in this, despite him not being the main character, but it would've been an all too big cliché considering he's well known for the Saw Franchise! But a great cameo nonetheless among the little known cast. Overall, it was a decent watch! A unique concept indeed & a great Horror & Thriller!",
         "I thought this movie was intense. I didn't find a second of it to be boring. This is just the kind of thriller I like when it comes to movies and books. I can only hope that the janitor paid in some way for what she did. There was no excuse for her behavior. She could have at least given the girls the medication but she wouldn't even look in the purse. This movie did not waste my time. I don't like when people leave reviews telling you not to waste your time on something, as though all people feel the same way they did about things. I also don't like when people claim good reviews are fake just because they didn't like a movie and somebody else did. Do these people really believe theirs is the only opinion?",
         "A real bundle of joy. Wasn't exactly having the best of days and happened to stumble across this film. I found myself glued to the screen right until the end. It's thought provoking entertaining nerve wrecking and everything a real thriller should have. I would say it's a surprise considering how I ended up watching this film but now I don't think that. I would watch this again and would encourage anybody to watch it. It will leave you asking questions throughout and then not wanting to move until it's over.",
         "A couple of sisters, one of which is extremely tough to like, get trapped in a covered swimming pool over a holiday weekend. While struggling to survive, they talk about all their clichéd issues (abusive father, drug addiction, petty jealousy, etc.). Then this bitch janitor with her own clichéd issues shows up and the whole film goes off the rails. I mean, I was into it for a little while because I'm a sucker for stories like this. That it was rife with clichés wasn't even killing it for me. But I guess they couldn't stretch that out for a feature film runtime so they added the janitor thing. Whatever they were going for with her character, they completely failed at it. She totally tanks the movie and it becomes less about surviving and more about beating this horrible woman the film mistakenly expects us to care about. And they don't even beat her, by the way. I won't say what happens but, if you're like me, you'll be screaming obscenities over the ending.",
         "Two sisters swimming at a public indoor pool get trapped beneath the pool cover. Things get really bad for them fast as the place closes up for holidays. I thought it seemed hokey to be stuck under a cover but a thick fiberglass sheet is a different story. One of the ladies is diabetic which ups the ante. Things get even worse when possible help turns around and extorts them. Similar to Extortion (2017). An emotional roller-coaster for sure as we find out they were abused and they lost their father in a fire. So all these different elements are wearing them down slowly. It is one of those films you find yourself yelling at the screen for them to either do this or don't do that. Which you can either love or hate. If you tune in for Tobin Bell his role is limited to telling people to get out and then he closes the pool cover. More of a fan winking cameo than anything. Overall the flick is pretty good and you might even shed a tear or two.",
         "Wow this was a Great thriller! It was Brutal and Harrowing and the acting from the two lead girls was Great!. This movie had me on the edge of my seat the whole way through!. I was so surprised at how good this movie ended up being! And I must say this is one of the best thrillers I've seen this year!.This movie is like 47 meters down only in a pool instead of the ocean. I really liked Nora-Jane in the movie, she is a good actress and her character was very believable and likable!. Her sister is played by Alexandra Park and her acting is also pretty good and I honestly can't fault her performance at all, both girls were Great! And I was blown away by their acting!. Alexandra Parks character may start off moody and slightly unlikable but she changes as the movie goes on and she becomes a stronger character and a likable one, and I thought the film handled her character transition very well. I put that down to Good Directing and good Acting, I also feel the writing is very solid too.I also loved the emotional intense music that was played near the end of the movie, it made the movie even more gripping!.I also thought the underwater scenes were shot well and I could really feel the Coldness that the girls were feeling and it makes you wonder What would You do to survive in a situation like that?. What makes This film work so well is the fact that they took a simple idea of two girls being trapped under a pool and they turned it into a Brutal and Nerve wrecking emotional thriller!. This is how you do a thriller the right way! By mixing emotion with thrills and when you care about the characters it works wonderfully!. in my opinion This is not just a thriller it's also a Character piece drama because the movie focuses on the relationship between the two sisters and their troubled past and the differences they have with each other and those differences cause them to argue when they get trapped under the pool, but it is later explained they were abused by their dad when they were kids and that was why the Jonna character was so angry and emotional at the start of the film, but I forgave her character and I thought she redeemed herself when she tried to save her sister's life.that's another thing I liked about this film it was like a life lesson as well as a thriller because by the end of the movie The Jonna character loves her sister and tries her hardest to Escape from the pool and save them both.by the end of the film the girl had changed and it was because she realised how important her sister was to her and it took them being in a life threatening situation to realise that and I think that's good writing for a movie. I feel that the movies message is that family always matters and even if you have issues with your family you should always try and work them out.Another good message i thought the film had was don't let your horrible past ruin your future! And that was a great message! And I totally Agree!. The girls were abused by their dad and that's terrible and we find out He got drunk and died one night.but the message I liked was moving on and leaving monsters in the past and I think that's a smart and good message!. The movie made me think as well as entertain me and I like movies that do that, I also like movies with messages and life lessons, and the two good messages in this movie were 1 leave monsters in the past and don't let them effect you emotionally and 2 family is important and even if you have issues with your sister those issues can be sorted out by talking about them. That proved to be right because as the movie goes on the sisters get closer and they try harder and harder to help each other to survive and they realised Working together as well as comforting each other was important. I don't know what else i can say about this movie except watch it! It's a Great Survival Thriller!.",
         "This tense contained thriller directed by Matt Eskandari finds its real depth in character development as well as its simple but diabolical premise. Trapped in an indoor public pool after the cover has been locked in place over a holiday weekend, two estranged sisters desperately cling to each other for survival, at the mercy of an unknown tormentor. Think about it: how long could you survive if you had to float with no food, no rest, and no heat, clad only in a bathing suit? The \"good\" older sister Bree projects a strength and vulnerability that at first leads the viewer to think she will be the key to their survival, but as her condition worsens (she's diabetic) it is black sheep Jonna who has to somehow find it in herself to step up to the plate and fight back against their circumstances, using skills she most likely learned in places her sister has never been. And here is the real star of the film: the performances between the two lead actors as they dissect not only their environment for means of escape but their entire relationship as they face possible death. There are conflicts and confessions, and writers Eskandari and Michael Hultquist skillfully play out not only each beat of suspense but the breaking and making of the precious and perilous bonds only siblings know. Tobin Bell's role is little more than a cameo and it is dispensed of early, so the real villain is Clara, a larcenous attendant fired just before the action begins. She doesn't show up until well into the film, but Diane Farr's haunting, taunting presence is what gives \"12 Feet Deep\" its memorable antagonist. Like Tobin Bell's Jigsaw, Clara is not there just to kill, but to teach a lesson in how precious life and loved ones are. Thanks to excellent underwater cinematography by Byron Werner--the camera roams the pool's confines like the belly of an enormous whale--and a suspenseful score by Todd Haberman, \"12 Feet Deep\" steers clear of clichés and easy outs all the way to its satisfying end.",
         "First of all, I really liked this movie. I was hoping it wouldn't be slow and boring like Open Water, and it was anything but. There was enough dialogue and action to keep me entertained throughout. The two actresses were amazing, and their acting was all very realistic. But just the ending made me so upset, I mean, this janitor lady nearly got you and your sister killed, and wouldn't budge on opening the cover on the pool no matter how much you plead, and you just let her go and forgive her? I would have made sure she paid dearly.",
         "Thought this was a great movie. Had me on the edge of my seat, one of the better lifetime movies. Yes I did shed a tear or two. It did scare me a little. I thought the acting was fantastic. I hope no one ever has to go through this. If you are a lifetime fan you should see this. Each character is dynamic in their own way. Truly shows the strength we all have inside, as well as redemption.",
         "I don't care if the film was based on a true story, there were just too many holes that made the story line implausible. First of all, why would an indoor olympic size swimming pool have an expensive mechanized plexiglas cover? A cover keeps dust dirt leaves and debris out of the pool to keep maintenance to a minimum. A cover also helps retain the temperature of a heated pool, by isolating the pool surface from cold evening air temperatures.Why would EITHER of those reasons apply to AN INDOOR POOL?? I worked briefly at a community rec center with a pool. Shutting down a facility like the one in this movie isn't as simple and turn-key as they show. The person charged with closing the facility would have at least 60 minutes worth of tasks before the place could be shut down and locked up. The movie made it look as though the man in charge walked out the door along with the last person leaving without doing a sweep of the facility AFTER lock down to make sure no stragglers or mischief makers remained hidden behind. Vehicles remaining in the pool parking would be a big red flag. Most community pools I know of are run to take in revenue. They charge admission and sell concessions and make vending machines available at steeply elevated prices. No outside food or drink is allowed in. I can't buy the notion that a heated indoor community pool would be closed for a 3 day weekend. That is when they take in the most revenue. It's almost as though they had this story about some girls who got trapped underneath a mechanical pool cover, but didn't bother to do any homework about how community pools are run. No attempt to patch some of these gaping holes in logic and common sense. In the end, the jailbird woman tries to punch in the code to free the trapped girls, but upon failing, she refuses to call cops because she's afraid she'll go back to the joint. But I guess being charged with murder is a non-issue. Please! I made it to the end, which says it kept me interested. My only reason for not giving it one star. But as the credits rolled, it seemed as though the writers just ran out of ideas about how to close it up. Would never recommend this film to anyone unless they were in an iron lung with absolutely nothing else to do and were bored to the point of suicide.",
         "I'm a sucker for these type of survivor thrillers, and 12 Feet Deep is a pretty good one about two sisters who find themselves trapped under the plexiglas cover of a large public swimming pool after its closed for a holiday weekend. The sisterly duo is effective and well-acted and there's enough tension and suspense to last for the entire 85 minute running time. For what was surely a low budget production, the underwater cinematography and musical score are surprisingly evocative. Worth a look for sure!",
         "Im starting to really doubt IMDb's way of user scoring, I feel like the director of this low budget film got all of his friends to vote highly to get a good start. How this film got a score of 8.3 ( as of 06, 20, 2017) is beyond me. I mean Inception scores 8.6, this film really is not that good. Why? mainly the acting, I mean I will give the director credit for filming something that doesn't look like a college students 1st film, and it is not his fault the girls in the film made such terrible decisions ( this is based on true events) but overall the film is poor. Do not watch this film based on the score it has, I would expect it should score a 5, Im going to give it a 4. Expect the DVD in a bargain bin near you.",
         "This was not a surprise to me, just by the name of the film and its cover page. Honestly, I don't understand why the high score. This is a very banal thriller with absolutely nothing special. The ladies poor childhood does not compensate for the bad acting and superficiality of the story which resembles so many similar movies. I had a very hard time watching it to the end. Maybe it is suitable for teenagers less than 14 years old.",
         "Suspend your disbelief a bit here, but what movie doesn't require it? It is basically 127 Hours or Open Water in a swimming pool. Two sisters visit a public pool the eve before a long holiday weekend. One loses her engagement ring in the pool so both swim down for it. Unaware the sisters are still under the water, Tobin Bell closes the fiberglass covering, trapping the sisters underneath. Unlike most trapped movies, this is differently NOT a horror movie. Or a horror-thriller. In the end, this film is a drama about the demons three women face over the course of 12 hours. If this film has a big issue it's that we aren't given a sense of a ticking clock. We are not made aware what time they get trapped, or how long they have been under the covering as time goes on. Above I said the film takes place over the course of 12 hours, but that is a guess, there is no way of knowing. Other than it's still night when the end comes (I think, there are no windows). What a trapped-thriller NEEDS is a ticking clock. We need to know how long the trapped have been in this situation. We need to know how long it will be before we can expect rescue. The film only states the pool will be closed for the holiday weekend, which basically means long enough for them to die. Not good enough. That small - but major - issue aside, this is a tight thriller. Well-made and slick at every turn. The leads are likable enough and the actresses give them simple human touches that many might overlook. The film's villain is the best part but I won't spoil who that is here. Wish there had been more with the villain. The final scenes leave a bit to be desired as the film opts for the opposite direction of most trapped-thrillers. I'm going to leave that vague, but the film ends with a Pixar whimper, instead of a Blum house bang. And we all know which one of those studio's movies we prefer. So is the ending bad? Not by any means. It's just not what this guy expected. But that's sometimes a welcome change of pace. As a guy that can count out every beat of every movie as I'm watching it, this flick surprised me with its ending. And that's something.",
         "I'm not gonna write an essay here. The plot sounds interesting, but everything else is bad, from scene angles (i don't know the right term), to movie script, all the way to very awkward acting beside first 7 min where's Tobin Bell who's presence just gives chill's and he's good at it. Actually the only reason i watched the movie is because i saw him on the movie trailer, and i was like goood the guy from S.a.w., saw him in few movies and thought this should be OK at least. He was out of the movie after a few scenes. For real the movie is bad, don't know why it has a score of 7.8. People gonna waste their time like me. Sincerely don't bother watching it.",
         "Really the only these people need to do is to learn to look more than 1ft in a direction. This movie is really a metaphor for ww2. I really don't understand because when they first get trapped in the pool they try to get the grate off, but then they totally forgot about for the whole movie."
