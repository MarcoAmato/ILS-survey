         "If the first movie was an awful \"rebel without cause\" movie, what can you do if the main character is no longer a rebel? This is a redemption film and, to be honest, that kind of stuff gives the chance to introduce a lot of dramatic and cry making content. But this film has a problem that shares with the first movie, and it's that when the film tries to be serious is when it absolutely fails. Not the plot, neither the characters or the story itself have the capacity to make the spectator anything more than a laugh (you will find out yourself doing more than one face palm with some of the scenes of this movies). The main character starred by Mario Casas is better in this film than in the first one. He has growed up and his personality is deeper. Mario isn't a superb actor, but he has charisma and he tries his best in order to show different sensations and the result is better than I expected. Continuing with the girls, Clara Lago, a Spanish revelation who can be seen in a lot of movies in this last years has a great chance to show her acting skills with her character, Gin, but, I'm sorry, she doesn't make the cut. She isn't convincing in the most dramatic scenes, and, this is my opinion, she isn't as cute as some people is trying to convince us. Her character isn't believable at all. The other female main character, Babi, starred by Spanish star Maria Valverde is just, OK, average, well done. Maria makes a plain performance, with the automatic pilot enabled, but she's such a star that even without making an effort steals your attention. In conclusion, this film is OK if you are only trying to watch a Barely entertaining film in which you can find a bit of romance, fight, friendship, adventure... but don't expect anything more. I should recommend it to every Spanish teenager girl who love Mario Casas and still dream with the bad-ass guy that can be changed with their love.",
         "It's really a shame that any romantic drama gets put in the \"soap\" corner. You can put the cliché tag on almost everything obviously, but when it is shown with actors playing convincing characters as in this one, you should be able to differentiate. I haven't seen the \"prequel\" either, but the movie still makes sense and is nicely told. And as said, the actors are really good. You should be aware, than different from US movies with a romantic touch (well most of them obviously, not all of them), you do get to see people having sex in this. Not explicit, but there are naked body parts that you will be exposed to. Why? Because it tries to keep it real and not give you just a romantic version of something that does not exist. Can you handle that?",
         "Having not seen the prequel, I am basing my comments strictly on this film (which is as it should be). This was basically a 2 hour perfume ad. We are subjected to many lingering shots of pretty faces, model bodies and high fashion in an assortment of nicely lit night settings. The problem is that someone forgot to add a story. Well, there is a story but it has all the depth of a puddle. The characters are adults all trapped in their early teen minds strongly emoting over a series of nothings. This young person's soap opera has the play-book of clichés--boy pouts over lost love, can new girl win his torn heart or will he return to his old love?, another girl gets pregnant from a fling, a mother discovers her husband is cheating on her, another mother lies dying in a hospital, a motor race to settle scores.......you've seen it all before in better, shorter movies.",
         "Tengo Ganas De ti (I Want You) (2012) This is the Sequel of Tres Metros Sobre el Cielo (Three Steps above Heaven), here you will find a different story because now they grow up and are living separate life , she has BF and hi a new girl, so this is about what happen after your first love. This is better than the first one because is more mature and the performances are more believable, but I have to say I didn't like the new girl too much. When I finished the film I start thinking that this movie is not exactly a love story about a couple, this is the love life of the male main character because here you have the new story of him with the new girl and he been hunting by the memories of his first love. This is definitely better than 3MSC and also very contemporary story. Both movies have a real message at the end. 1- When something is broken it would never be the same. & 2- You need two committed people to make a relationship work.

         "The first time I saw this movie was on TV...then I watched it 5 times again. Then I created subtitles for this movie on my own, just so I could show it to my friends. In short, I love this movie. Probably the best movie I have ever seen. Can I explain myself objectively and make arguments for why? No. This movie just left such an impression on me that I couldn't forget about it and watched it over and over. The drama, the romance, the acting, the flirting, the sadness...I just felt such an roller-coaster of emotions watching this movie and it hooked me from the first 5 minutes. I can't recommend it highly enough.",
         "I would have preferred H having returned either having worked overseas or having completed his studies and then look up a job either with his brother or elsewhere. Moreover his silent love for Babi should have continued wherein Babi's parents finally realize that the boy has changed and make way for him to meet Babi to forget the past and reconcile and continue their loving life to really be Three metres above the heaven.

But if Gin would have told him that Babi had called that night. And if he would have looked for her when he came from Londres or at least kept communication with her, so that she could see him changing, then they would have stayed together. This is just one outcome..."
