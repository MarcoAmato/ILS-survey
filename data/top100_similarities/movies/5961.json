I really enjoyed Jamie Lee Curtis and Ron Silver's charisma and acting, both when they were falling in love and later when they were at each other's throats. Very good soundtrack by Brad Fiedel--surprisingly, I liked it much more than Tangerine Dream's work in Bigelow's earlier Near Dark. If you can forgive the plot holes and just go along for the ride, it's a surprisingly rewarding film.",

         "This is a movie about guns, two-handed combat positions, reloading, spent cartridges, gore, .44 magnums, shooting deaths in slow motion, and all that. If you liked, say, \"Magnum Force,\" you'll love this one. There is one small problem with this slickly made cop thriller, though, and that is that it makes no sense whatever. The implausibility is apparent from the first action scene onward. Jamie Lee Curtis is a rookie cop who stumbles onto a hold up in a supermarket. Curtis, by the way, although she looks just fine in every other regard, is one of those people like Clint Eastwood that caps simply don't sit comfortably on, but never mind. Back to the hold up. The perp has got the few customers lying face down on the floor and shivering with fear. The perp is ordering the checkout man to give him the cash while Curtis, gun drawn, sneaks up behind him. She announces her presence and tells him to \"put the gun down,\" three times, very clearly. She has a bead on him. So what does the perp do? He smirks, says something like, \"I ain't here to argue with you, B****!\" and swings his gun towards her. She turns into a human firing squad and blasts him through the window. His gun clatters unnoticed to the floor and Ron Silver, one of the customers, surreptitiously pockets it and leaves. Well, fellas and girls, the perp's gun is not found at the scene of the shooting. Furthermore, NOBODY, not the shivering customers, not the counterman, has even SEEN the perp's gun. It is automatically assumed by all of her male superiors at the department that she hysterically killed an unarmed man. (Maybe he was soliciting for Friends of the Earth.) And we have the obligatory scene in which the put-upon and misunderstood cop must turn over his or her badge and gun to his or her boss. I won't go on with further examples. These impossibilities are only there to advance the plot, and, trust me, the plot needs advancing. First of all, I don't believe Ron Silver as a gun-loving psychotic. I would believe Ron Silver as a Jewish lawyer, yes, preferably Allan Dershowitz, but not an escapee from the Englewood Cliffs Home for Fetishists. If the guy could bring together all the voices in his head he could form a light opera company. Not that Silver does a bad job. When he pays an unannounced visit to Curtis's parents his eyes seem to glow with a rich hint of lunacy. Curtis isn't bad either, possibly because we already know that she doesn't take herself too seriously as an actress. She is brutally but engagingly self aware. Clancy Brown begins as a nudnik homicide detective who ridicules Curtis but then comes to love her, or at least to like her enough to bed her. Well, I can't help myself. I'm going to mention another impossibility. Curtis is hospitalized and wants desperately to get out. She lures another cop, a beefy one, into her room, clips him on the jaw and cold cocks him. Wait -- that's not the implausibility I'm getting at. She then steals the cop's uniform and it fits her rather nicely. We would all, I think, like to know more about the cop who lost his uniform. For instance, why is he wearing a shirt with bust darts? But let that go too. We follow Curtis as she leaves the hospital without anyone knowing about it. She walks through the city streets. (This is New York we're talking about.) She walks down into the subway and we realize that Silver is following about twenty feet behind her. How did he get there? How could he know she would sneak out of the hospital? In police drag? Never mind. That's not the implausibility I was getting at either. THIS is that implausibility -- she has never looked behind her and yet, in the subway, at the moment Silver raises his gun to shoot her in the back, she whirls about and exchanges shots with him. This amounts to ESP on Curtis's part and I suggest her brain would make a neat addition along with Paul Broca's to La Musee de l'Homme in Paris. The photography is dazzling, in many ways the best part of the film, although too much use is made of neon blue in night shots. Manhattan looks glorious from a helicopter at night, possibly because you can't see any people from there, just glittering skyscrapers. I wish Curtis would not have shot the no-longer dangerous Silver at the end. I mean, the poor guy had already taken three or four bullets in the movie -- par for the course for a crime thriller, true, but still undoubtedly painful. And he's now out of bullets. And furthermore he is as nutty as a fruitcake, babbling on about \"seeing the radiance,\" and \"you were my brilliance,\" and screaming at the voices that torment him. I realize everyone is panting to see this maniac plugged full of mortal holes but, after all, he belongs in a psychiatric hospital not a morgue. Well, who cares? Not Kathryn Bigelow and her co-writer. This is a commercial piece and not designed to do much more than grab you by the lapels and shake you. It does that okay. It would have been nice, though, if the director, having lingered over such testosterone-rich concepts as death by gunshot, had seen fit to linger a bit longer over Jamie Lee Curtis as she rolls nude from her bed after being savaged by Silver. I guess you have to be philosophical about these things.",
         "Jamie Lee Curtis is one of Hollywood's more diverse actresses-- from being heralded the \"Scream Queen\" for such films as HALLOWEEN and THE FOG, to comedic genius in A FISH CALLED WANDA and TRUE LIES. Her portrayal of a rookie cop who becomes the target of an obsessed stalker (Ron Silver) after her first assignment on the force solidifies her acting abilities and film repertoire. Ron Silver plays the Wall-Street-broker-turned-psychopath flawlessly. BLUE STEEL is a cop flick with a twist which, unlike many films in the genre, showcases a lead female's descent through the police force. Amir M. Mokri's encompassing and somber cinematography, Brad Fiedel's ambient and chilling musical score, and Kathryn Bigelow's cool, detached direction, combined with the excellent cast which also includes Louise Fletcher, Clancy Brown, and Elizabeth Peña, makes for a unique, entertaining, and esthetically pleasing film!",
         "Jamie Lee Curtis plays officer Megan Turner, a rookie cop who kills an armed robber her first day on the job. During the commotion, one of the witnesses, Eugene Hunt, a Wall St. gold trader played by Ron Silver, snatches the robber's gun and, faster than you can say \"junk bonds\", turns into a psychopathic serial killer with an obsessive fixation on both the gun and Turner. The total absence of intelligence in this movie makes it painful to watch. Even after Hunt murders her closest friend on her doorstep, Turner continues to spend her evenings at her apartment, never bothering to so much as check the place out for intruders. So it comes as little shock when Hunt is there waiting for her one night. No one else in the movie manages to demonstrate an IQ higher than their age, either: a supermarket clerk, after being threatened by a gun-wielding maniac for five long, tedious minutes, replete with threats to \"blow him away\", later, under police questioning, says that the weapon might have been a knife. The only reason for such staggering stupidity is that it was necessary to force an unwilling script kicking and screaming down an unlikely plot-line. So stay away from this one, folks. It's not even bad enough to be funny.",
         "This cast contributed everything they had to this work, the story line is awesome, and the execution is purely entertaining. So what went wrong? As slick as this stylish detective/thriller is, it lacks an ending which denotes the wit and keen intellect throughout. In other words, the ending was weak enough to throw off this whole work. Jamie Lee Curtis, nor any of her cast mates represents the problem. The problem was in the writing, however, this is still quite compelling, and dramatizes an interesting story, which has the ability to pull you in and build some awesome suspense. All in all, although it fails to deliver satisfactorily in the end, the process getting you there is quite entertaining. It rates a 6.8/10 from... the Fiend :.",
         "This is a bit of an oddity. Usually movies are either really good or really bad all the way through. Rarely do I see a film where there are a ton of good moments, but just as many dumb ones. I mean, this film really tries to take cop movies in a different direction in many ways. Example one: our hero cop is female. Example two: our obligatory psycho is a commodities trader(???). Example three: something I've never seen from a movie wacko: he actually hears voices! So many times the killer is without explanation doing what he's doing. But here, Silver actually has extended scenes where he's hearing someone(?) and possibly trying to fight them. It's never explained. Which is where we get into the negative elements, as Silver's motivation isn't fleshed out. Was he a psycho before the early scene shootout? Why is he a nut? We never know, except that he feels a certain power in killing. Plus, even though I appreciated the attempt, his freaky moments of hearing whomever come off a bit silly. But back on the good side he has some very effective moments with Curtis, which mix psychosis and sexualitly nicely. The NYC locations are also well used thanks to some nice cinematographic touches. Ah, alas, we must go back to the junk side, particularly Curtis' cliched superiors. All the typical \"My ass in a sling! Mayor's ass in a sling! Chief's ass in a sling!\" Or TWO superiors, who in reference to a scene from the beginning, falsely say that Curtis blew the guy's HEAD off. Her shots were grouped in his chest and never at his head. For them to TWICE proclaim otherwise put a big hole in their credibility. Then you have a totally underdeveloped subplot about Curtis father, who is apparently beating her mother. He is rightfully arrested only to be forgiven moments later and back at the house (what is veteran Bosco doing in such a poorly defined roll??). Or how bout when Jamie Lee beds down with a superior...right after the killer has just run off into the night in front of them!!! Tack on an overlong and predictable ending and you have something that started off in the right direction but quickly veered into an NYC pothole.",
         "\"Blue Steel\" is an action-packed cop drama in which a female police officer is stalked by a violent psychopath who terrorises her and also puts the lives of her family and friends in danger. Her ordeal isn't helped by the lack of support that she receives from her employers or the negative way in which most people respond to her choice of career. Megan Turner (Jamie Lee Curtis) is a New York City cop who, on her first night in the job, shoots and kills a gunman who was holding up a supermarket. When the robber's gun falls to the floor, one of the customers, a commodities broker called Eugene Hunt (Ron Silver), picks it up and leaves. Shortly after the incident, Megan is suspended from duty because the absence of a weapon suggests that she may have panicked and killed an unarmed man. Soon, a number of dead bodies are found on the streets of the city and it becomes evident that they are all victims of a serial killer who's shooting people at random with bullets which have Megan's name inscribed on them. At this point, homicide detective Nick Martin (Clancy Brown) arranges for Megan to be reinstated in the hope that she can help him to catch the killer. The manipulative Eugene Hunt arranges to meet Megan and starts courting her and soon she starts to fall for him. His obsession with her was sparked by her actions on the night of the shooting and it takes a little time before Megan realises that he's seriously disturbed and very dangerous. The danger that Megan finds herself in then continues to escalate steadily as every effort she makes to stop his rampage meets with the same lack of success. Megan Turner's character is the main focus of this film and she's shown to be someone who, as a child, was made to feel angry and powerless because she grew up in a home where her mother was regularly beaten by her father. Her chosen career was attractive to her because it enabled her to exercise power over others and prevent herself from becoming a victim like her mother. Megan's anger, however, is ever present and so when she's asked why she chose to become a police officer, she replies in a semi-humorous way \"I like to slam people's heads against walls\". This remark is revealing because it's not the type of comment that any well-adjusted person would make and it highlights just how brittle a personality she is. Jamie Lee Curtis captures her character's mixture of toughness, determination and fear perfectly and Ron Silver makes a very strong impression as the unhinged villain who seems completely unstoppable. \"Blue Steel\" is stylishly made and remains engaging throughout despite the fact that it requires a little too much suspension of disbelief at various junctures in order to enjoy it fully.",
         "******SPOILERS****** \"Blue Steel\" is basically a film about a crazed Wall Street commodities broker Eugene Hunt, Ron Silver, who has a religious experience one night. At a neighborhood grocery store rookie policewomen Magen Turner, Jamie Lee Curtis, blasts away a robber, Tom Sizemore, who tried to shoot her as well as those in the store including Eugene. Ehgene crabs the dead crooks .44 Magnum and takes off with it before the backup team came on the crime scene leaving Magen with no proof that the robber had a gun and leaving her open to disciplinary charges by the NYPD. Back home Eugene treating the .44 as if it were a religious item to be both worshiped and revered. Eugene feels that Magen is the missing part of his religious experience and plans to get to know her to make it all complete. Eugene gets friendly with Magen by getting her a cab and then treating her to dinner at a swanky restaurant. Eugene even takes Magen on a helicopter ride over NYC at night. As Eugene wines and dines Magen he secretly goes out at night shooting people with her missing .44 using bullets with Magen's name scratched on the casings. This gets Magen into even more trouble with the baffled police department thinking that she's somehow responsible for those murders. The crazed Eugene seem untouchable from both the police as well as the courts. No matter how much proof the police have on him his high priced lawyer always gets Eugene off on some technicality. Eugene even gets away with shooting Magen's best friend Tracy Perez, Elizabeth Pena, right in front of her eyes! That cold blooded murder on Eugene's part still wasn't enough to convict much less arrest him for the crime? After offing what seemed like scores of people with the police and the NYC justice department totally helpless to stop him the movie finally ends with a shootout between Magen and the crazed broker in the Wall Street section of Manhattan. The shootout starts in the subway and ended in the streets. Eugene ends up not only getting blasted with a full magazine by Magen but also run over by her. It seems that Magen is the only policeman, or it this case policewomen, on duty in the entire city, was the New York Police Force on a coffee break? This movie is nuts and ridicules just like Eugene but one thing that it isn't is boring. It's a small wonder that anyone involved with this movie ever survived to make another film.",
         "Difficult to know what to make of this one. The cinematography is beautiful, as is Jamie Lee Curtis as New York cop Megan Turner. She has the misfortune to come across a supermarket robber on her first day of active service and ends up killing him. Unfortunately the robber's weapon disappears as it is stolen by Eugene Hunt (Ron Silver) who is a mentally ill trader with a fixation on Turner, who reciprocates his advances! With no weapon and despite witnesses and cctv, she is suspended from her job, giving her time to mess around with Hunt. It's never made clear what she sees in this creep. He's nuts. Clancy Brown plays Nick Mann, fellow detective who teams up with a reinstated Turner to try to find the 44 Magnum killer who always leaves a shell etched with Turner's name at the scene of the killings. The plot is odd but actually quite interesting. Curtis is very watchable, and the director knows it. Overall, a slightly flawed gem, and worth viewing.",
         "Jamie Lee Curtis gives a superb and winning performance as Megan Turner, an eager and gutsy, but neurotic and vulnerable rookie cop who blows away a supermarket hold-up guy (an electrifying cameo by Tom Sizemore) on her first night of active duty. Demented Wall Street broker Eugene Hunt (a terrifyingly intense and wired portrayal by Ron Silver) steals the crook's gun and embarks on a killing spree (he carves Megan's name on the bullets, no less!). Moreover, Hunt also begins dating the initially unsuspecting Turner. Director Kathryn Bigelow, who also co-wrote the sharp and incisive script with Eric Red, relates the compelling narrative at a constant quick pace, expertly builds plenty of gut-ripping tension, gives the film an attractive polished look, and really pulls out all the stirring stops for the rousing climactic shoot-out between Hunt and Turner on the streets of New York City. This film further benefits from fine acting by a bang-up cast: Curtis makes for a very strong and sympathetic, yet troubled and flawed heroine, Silver's cunning and charming psycho likewise sizes up as a memorably crazed and frightening villain, plus there's sound supporting turns by Clancy Brown as tough, cynical homicide detective Nick Mann, Elizabeth Pena as Megan's loyal friend Tracy Perez, Louise Fletcher as Megan's timid, browbeaten mother Shirley, Philip Bosco as Megan's gruff, abusive father Frank, Kevin Dunn as the stern Assistant Chief Stanley Hoyt, and Richard Jenkins as cagey, sarcastic attorney Mel Dawson. Brad Fiedel's shivery, rattling score and Amir M. Mokri's slick, striking cinematography are both excellent and effective. Granted, the story is wildly implausible, but thankfully Curtis' complex and intriguing central characterization of Meg, the hard, gritty tone, the riveting cat and mouse games between Hunt and Turner, and, most of all, Bigelow's stunning sense of pure cinematic style and panache keep the picture on track. A taut, edgy and absorbing little winner.",
         "I agree with the reviewer prior to me. I am actually taking a film class at my college and we brought up the same points the last reviewer did. It wasn't the best coherent film I seen. The fact that the killer \"mysteriously\" knew where the protagonist was all the time and also knew all about her parents and friends was pretty absurd. Not to sound redundant, but I agree that a little more info on the history of the murderer would have helped the audience when it came to perceiving and understanding the movie. In the other side, when it comes to suspense I guess the movie is okay. If you're the type of person that doesn't care about how coherent a plot is and just like to see action, then you will like this film."

         "On her first day on the job, NYPD officer Megan Turner, the lone officer on the scene, shoots and kills the perpetrator of a supermarket hold-up. Since no gun was found on the perpetrator's person or at the scene and none of the witnesses could corroborate Megan's story definitively that the perpetrator was indeed wielding a gun, she is suspended from active duty. She is quickly albeit temporarily reinstated to the position of homicide detective because the spent shell casing from the bullet used in a subsequent murder had her name carved on it. This murder ends up being only the first in a series. Working on the case with fellow homicide detective Nick Mann, Megan initially has no idea who in her life could be the murderer. In short order, the murderer does show himself to her. He is commodities trader Eugene Hunt who she met immediately following her suspension and who she has since dated. He also implies to her that he was in the supermarket at the time of the hold-up and that he fled the scene with the perpetrator's gun. The supermarket shooting caused a psychotic break in him which resulted in among other things his obsession with her. However, beyond his implications only to her of being the murderer, Megan has no hard evidence that would stand up in a court of law that Eugene is indeed the murderer. Megan has to convince her colleagues, especially Nick, that she is telling the truth about Eugene, while stopping him from killing again and equally as important stopping him from his continued psychological torture of her.",
