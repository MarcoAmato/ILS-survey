      "reviews": [
         "I wasn't sure what to expect but was pleasantly surprised for this low budget film. Suspenseful, action packed and good story line, this movie kept me waiting for what was next. The first five minutes got you straight into the film with the murder of a girl thought to be the daughter of Lex Walker. As the plot unfolded, it was easy to see who was behind the murder but the suspense came when you didn't know where his investigation would lead him next. Good mix with the British and American cast. The action was great, clean and not blood thirsty which tied in well with Lex Walkers character as a military man. Only criticism is I would have liked it better without all the 'F' bombs, the movie would have been better without it.",
         "For a film with Jason Patric and James Caan, this movie is very disappointing. The movie started well actually, but as soon as Lex Walker (played by Craig Fairbrass)showed up it went downhill from there. The storyline was terrible. For a movie that looked like it has a lot of action in it, well I nearly went to sleep watching it. The ending was even pretty bad. I mean there was shooting upstairs and yet nobody downstairs heard any shots until two bodies fell into the pool. Schuuster (played by James Caan) was no more than 10 meters from the pool, fired about 12 shots and hit his target once. Definitely give this one a miss.",
         "I like Craig Fairbrass as a lead, he comes across a lot like the ham fisted Liam Neeson in a performance that is very similar to Taken, in the part plaid by Firbanks only, the story does not develop in any way like Taken there is just a similarity in the characters. Beyond that noise there is a decent movie here with action, and some good suspense. Not much beyond a TV movie, though of a decent quality. The story is well written, it takes from a few other stories of this genre, and weaves it's own results. I Enjoyed the character development, and the action was good, always fast, and back to the story with a good flow. I would recommend this one to action movie fans, on the whole it is really not exceptional, but it will fill some time, and you won't feel ripped off at the end. Some language, and a bit of blood, but very tame really for what it could be, and even compared to the way Seagal used to break things back in the 90's.",
         "This could have been a really good film but we struggled to hear the whole film. The English accent of the main character was not brilliant and the West Coast US accent of many of the actors meant it really difficult to hear individual words. We went through all the changes of sound on our system - even turned off the surround sound in case this made a difference, but each the voices were mumbled and muffled. it was a case of guess the words the whole way through. Have to say though, that I have to nominate Craig Fairbrass for a better Jack Reacher than Tom Cruise. I hope Lee Childs etc decide to change the actor for the next film",
         "This movie is not very good. That said, it's not awful and it will hold your interest long enough so that you stick with it to the end -- but I can't put my finger on why. The problems with it are the characters, all one-dimensional stereotypes. We've got the British military giant-of-a-man, the estranged daughter, the detective and the corporate bad guy, as well as a handful of others who don't do anything beyond bulk up the cast list. Take the Brit for example: His accent is convincing until you realise it can't decide if it's London or Northern, switching back and forth between the two often within the same sentence. His character is our lead and so we get behind him in his search for his daughter that seems to consist entirely of one coincidence after another with several scenes that see him beating up people for no good reason. The actor is not very good and has to be carried by his costars. I will say this for the movie: James Caan is great in it. Overall this movie is okay but nothing special. It's just so by the books and lifeless that you shouldn't care but there's something about it that makes you care anyway. This movie is a good way to kill some time on an evening in but that's about it.",
         "You know the story/drill here, it'll be hardly surprising how this will develop. Recently there was another movie called \"Prince\" which had Bruce Willis in it (well sort of), but the real funny thing is that Jason Patric was in that movie too. He had a different role than that he has in this one, but just the fact that he'd be in such similar movies alone is kind of crazy. The action scenes are decent, though nothing to get too excited about. James Caan is great as always, even if his role is pretty paper thin, he makes the most of it. It's very simple as stated before and acting from other is not really something to look forward to exactly. Without Caan I'd given this max a 4/10",
         "I'm going to be struggling to manage the required number of words to review this one. Mainly because I couldn't finish it because it was so below average. I did try though. However, the low budget shots with almost no camera work and incredibly stifled and stereotypical acting was just too much for me, and I had to can it about half way through. I guess if you had absolutely nothing else to watch, nowhere to go and no friends to talk to, then this might just be what you need to fill in a couple of hours. But if this does not describe you then I would steer clear of this shocker and go and do something more constructive - like updating your facebook status.",
         "Sleepy Action Movie with a Few Familiar Faces for Support and a Hulking Tough Guy from across the Pond. The Plot is as Haggard and Confused as the Driving Fights are Buy the Book Boring. James Caan Struggles for Breath, not During a Confrontation but just a Conversation and Jason Patric is Forgettable as are the Two Beauties along for Eye Candy. Craig Fairbrass is the Star Sporting a Large Frame, Military Training, and a Thick Accent that makes things even Less Attainable. Overall, it is Not Worth Much even for the Most Completest of DTV Action Junkies and those who are the most Forgiving of Fisticuffs and Firearms Fans, because this one has a Pacing that just Plods.",
         "Review: This is your basic crime thriller movie about a man trying to find his daughter who has been mistakenly identified as dead. If you've seen Craig Fairbrass movies before, then you know what to expect. He basically goes round kicking ass and the performances aren't anything amazing. It does seem quite low budget, even though James Caan and Jason Patric are in the movie, but you do end up sticking with it because the storyline takes time to unfold. The action does seem real and the storyline isn't totally bad, but it isn't one of those movies that will stick out in your mind. Average! Round-Up: Even since the failure of Speed 2, Jason Patric has fallen off of the radar and he only pops up in movies every now and again. After the promising Lost Boys his career hadn't really taken off due to bad choices and an acting style that isn't that unique. James Caan just seems to take any role that comes along, but he will always be remembered for the Godfather and Misery. Craig Fairbrass will always be type casted because of his big build and his cockney accent. We will never see if he can really act until he does something out of his comfort zone. Budget: $4million Worldwide Gross: N/A I recommend this movie to people who are into there crime/thrillers about a an English man trying to find his daughter in America. 2/10",
         "Seriously seriously seriously this movie is the biggest try hard movie out there, the camera angles really anoyyed me it's not a A-class movie is say it's D-grade movie so terrible I'm saving you guys now don't watch it movie is so stupid. okay so let me get this straight if your still reading this that means your still unsure okay ....fine storyline hmmm well read the storyline for Barbie and the nutcracker it is a much stronger storyline. Actors again there D-grade actors main character is like a try hard Jason statham big time. camera angles irritated me so much it's like there amateur camera man trying to be professionals it was so bad save your time and look for another movie"
