Well, it was not like I never saw such film. In a century of motion picture history, hundreds of similar films were made. This is just another one, but there's nothing wrong with it. People wrongly judged it. The pace of the film was rocket speed. So basically, there's no time for one to keep looking for flaws. If they do, then they're not enjoying the show. They missed out everything, hence end up bashing it. Just like the clowns, aka film critics.\r\n\r\nIt was another kidnap film that Halle Barry in it, that's similar to her previous film 'The Call'. It did not take long to get into the action. A hardworking mother, going through divorce, fighting for her son's custody. While engaging in a phone call, she loses her son in an amusement park. The alert mother quickly jumps into pursuing when he was seen forcefully taken in a stranger's car. The remaining events take place on the road, with car chases, with a twist before the conclusion.\r\n\r\nNicely written screenplay and well performed actors, particularly Halle Berry. I have never seen she had played such an energetic role in the recent time. Whatever the storyline is, it's kind of an inspiring film. How a mother fought for her son. Totally a mother instinct. You can't simply expect like the film 'Taken'. It might not be realistic, but cinematically honest. The same thing happens in the animal world too. Sad that the film released after so many delays. Moreover, how people responded to it. Believe me, it is a nice film and I definitely suggest it to all.\r\n\r\n_8/10_",

         "First off, let me just say that I can rarely be bothered to write reviews on here. The only reason I decided to was due to: 1) lack of reviews, and most importantly 2) the very few reviews that have been posted here are so incomprehensively negative that the only explanation I can come up with was that they had to be shills (which is surprising to me, as most 'shills' on IMDb are only here to artificially increase a film's positive reviews). That being said, I found these these first two negative reviews utterly baffling. Now I'm no expert film critic, but movies are my number one passion in life. As such, I've seen so many that I've literally arrived to the point where I'm thoroughly jaded...so much so that most everything that I've seen usually leaves me both bored and uninterested, or at best, mildly amused. Now that I've had my mini-rant, I'll continue on with my review. As the title of the film implies, the story is as basic as it gets: a mother's son gets kidnapped, and said mother stops at nothing to get him back. From that simple premise (which has been rehashed millions of times), I began watching this with the expectation that I'll be seeing one cliché after another, with gratuitous violence and over-blown CGI and/or cheesy effects mixed in for good measure. I can honestly say that not only were those expectations overturned, but for the first time that I can remember, I was literally sat on the edge of my seat and kept in suspense throughout. That statement may sound generic and trite, but coming from a jaded cinephile, it becomes a huge compliment. I never lost interest for a second, and the sheer intensity and suspense that I felt throughout 'Kidnap' got to the level where I was actively looking to see how many more minutes was left before it ended\u0085not because I was bored and wanted to know how much more tedium I had to suffer, but so that I could tell how much more hell the protagonist (and by extension, I) had to go through before all the nail-biting suspense could finally come to an end. It was a taught cat-and-mouse thriller expertly choreographed, and Halle Berry's acting was sublime! In fact, I was initially so put-off by the film's synopsis, I would have passed this over in an instant had it not been for the fact that Ms Berry was in it! The acting, cinematography and stunt-work were masterfully crafted in such a way so as to get you emotionally invested throughout. I think that is why this film engendered such a visceral reaction whilst watching it. If you cannot relate to nor care about the characters, the film you're watching falls flat, and you consequently lose interest very quickly. Not so with 'Kidnap'. The relatability of Berry's character, plus the superb job she did with this role, puts you right in the car seat next to her. If you are like me, and suffer from the ennui that inevitably comes from having seen almost every movie ever made, and are looking for the proverbial 'white knuckle ride' and adrenaline rush, then I cannot recommend 'Kidnap' strongly enough. In fact, I wouldn't be exaggerating to say that this is on my top 4 list of films I've seen this year thus far! So in a way, I give thanks to the two negative reviewers. Had it not been for them, I wouldn't have even bothered writing this review!",
         "Not really even sure where to start. We'll go through the low points blow by blow. Storyline - there isn't one. The entire plot makes no sense, and is so ridiculous as to have you laughing out loud for most of the movie. Yeah kid gets kidnapped and mother will stop at nothing to get him back. Seen that before. But what you've not seen is the utter drivel they come up with in this movie. Utter garbage dressed up as some kind of action. It's the worst story I've seen in as long as I can remember. I haven't even got to the end yet, and I'm writing this. Acting - woeful beyond belief. Halle Berry would have to have been utterly desperate to get involved with this garbage. Minutes of talking to herself about how she won't let her kid go, all while in the middle of a car chase. Obviously the part is written and there's not much she can do about the story line, but unless she needs the money, she'd just walk away. No idea why she's even involved. Action - appalling. 'High-speed' stunts filmed at about 5km/h, then sped up to seem faster. Non-sensical action scenes that add nothing other than further ridicule to this movie. Cinematography - I can't say I've ever seen anything as laughably appalling as this. During the 'high-speed' chases, we get minutes worth of tyre-going-around footage, interspersed with minutes of yellow lines on the road. We get it - they're driving. Overall this movie is atrocious and simply not worth your time. Unless you want to spend a couple hours yelling at the TV to get her to actually do something towards getting her son back. Abysmal, appalling, ghastly garbage.",
         "I love action movies without aliens and superheroes so I was exited to see this movie where Halle Berry goes all out in her attempts to safe her kid. The base of the story isn't that bad but oh how I hate it when writers can't come up with logical behavior even in high pressure situations. With a little bit more creativity this actually could have been a very decent movie, but they took the easy way and at times it just was annoying how the story developed. So a big disappointment.",
         "I normally wouldn't write a spoiler for a review, but I find it necessary to pick this movie apart piece by piece 'cos the story was a load of Bull. First of all, I'm not sure which pisses me off more, the script writer that left so many holes in the story or the main character which Halle Berry played quite well. Suffice to say, while I find Halle's acting to be believable, I find the personality of the character she played quite confusing and unappealing. I really couldn't help disliking her and her choices from the beginning of the movie till the very end. I thought, \"well, how stupid can she get\" every five minutes. And here is why. 1. Why didn't she slam into the kidnappers' car when she had the chance at the stop light? I would think adrenaline was pumping at that moment the incidence just occurred and some more desperate howbeit reckless attempt would have been made to recover the boy. 2. It took her so long to get on the phone and call the cops while chasing the car that had her son. Really?! And don't tell us she lost her phone. All you need to do to attract the police in all 50 states is to rear end or side swipe a few cars and keep going. They will do the calling for you. She didn't as much as bash any other vehicle during the first half of the \"desperate\" chase. 3. She was driving like my granny. 4. The scene where a cop on a motorcycle attempted to pull her over was just so silly. All she had to was keep going when the cop asked her to pull over till he called it in and had other cops on the chase. well, another scene that made this character seem like an idiot. 5. So she offered up her financial instruments and didn't think to keep the pin as bargaining chip till she was at the point of ensuring an exchange then went ahead to let the kidnapper into her car... Not beside her, behind her. Then drove to a secluded highway. Why on earth would the kidnapper that has your son, your cards, your pin, keep you alive when the only thing keeping you from reporting the cards stolen is being alive? Is this character just daft or these is how people actually react when they are in crisis? 6. She overpowers and throws out a woman twice her size, positioned behind her while she is driving and being strangled at the same time out of a moving mini-van. All the while with door closed. The only script allowed to have that sort of impractical scenario is a James Bond movie. Absolutely unbelievable. The woman also came into her vehicle with no phones on her with which to alert her \"boyfriend\" when she was tossed from the car? 7. She actually stopped a stranger from getting run over by putting her vehicle between said stranger and a car about to run him over at a time she had the option of intercepting the kidnapper about to get away with her son. I believe natural instinct is self preservation before all else except a person has specific training to react otherwise in those circumstances. When i saw this scene, it didn't make her out to be a hero to me, I just felt she must not be trying to save her son. 8. It took her almost an hour into the movie after driving Miss Daisy behind the kidnappers for her to realize she could rear end the car... guess what? Right about the time the car was running empty on gas. *roll my eyes* 9. The kidnappers were painted not as newbies, but repeat offenders who did this for a living. Well, it didn't look like it. If they were pros, they had every opportunity to take the boy across state lines while the mum was taking a \"cruise\" around town. 10. Then there is the question of how the boy made it from the car with the male kidnapper to the house where the kids were being kept. One moment, the boy is in the car with the male kidnapper being chased by the mum in distress, the next moment, the mum is asking \"where is my son?\" and she's fishing for an ID on the kidnapper's lifeless body. #Sheish! 11. Kidnappers' Den. She sees a sawn off shotgun lying on a table and she leaves it. Really?! She's anti-gun? 12. The boat ploy was also dumb. If she could fool the woman, she couldn't fool a dog for a second. The dog would have gone for the water immediately and started barking not after she had fired off a few rounds into an empty boat which un-propelled was able to move away from a powerful flashlight that fast? Errmmm! Really? So I guess the only thing you could consider smart about the main character was the fact that she was able to pick up on the \"neighbour's\" lie? Psssssh! The main character was not properly developed and profiled. First acting conservative and unsure of what to do then later switching to aggressive, alpha personality. Every other thing that occurred in this plot was pure luck and stupidity on the kidnappers part. Well, I didn't see any well calculated attempt at recovering the child. The script is weak and empty. So thumbs down. I lost empathy for her and felt like smacking a head all though the movie maybe to knock a little sense into her. She should be loosing custody after this episode.",
         "I saw this because I like Halley Berry movies and figured that this would be another good movie. I was horribly wrong. The plot has too many holes and makes no sense whatsoever. After many miles of \"chasing\" the kidnappers she finally thinks to ram into them once her van is almost out of gas? Did she think to do this when they were stuck in traffic or while surrounded by cars on the highway? Or maybe when there was a cop following her? Nope, she waits until they are on a deserted road. When the kidnapper comes after her with a shotgun, where does the genius hide? In her mini van with wrap around windows. Good thing the bad guy decides not to shoot out the glass and shoot her. Finally we get near the end of this horrible movie and the woman kidnapper sicks a dog on the Halley Berry and her kid. Somehow after killing the kidnapper the dog mysteriously disappears and never shows up again. Possibly the dog was as board with this movie as the audience and simply gave up to do something better. These are not the only horrible parts of the movie, but the most glaring. It's an hour and half of my life that I wish that I could get back. Do not be fooled by the positive reviews, this is a horrible movie and should be skipped.",
         "Warning Spoilers! This main character is so damn stupid. Beyond any reasonable logic. When she had a chance to kill the man who took her son, she didn't. When it's time for some cool stunt driving scenes, the highway is full of cars. Other times when she is just following the kidnappers car, there isn't a single car on the entire highway or 10 minutes! It's just to aggravating to watch a lead character who makes such stupid decisions just to further the film. The stupidity continues throughout the film. I wish someone would have kidnapped me before I started to watch this film. Avoid it.",
         "I've never yelled at a movie more than this. I literally made an account to tell anyone how bad this film is. No one acts like this if their kid is taken, she doesn't hit the car, she doesn't hit the people that took her kid. She had multiple chances to do so. Whoever wrote this script and directed this movie should never be able to work on a set ever again.",
         "The trailer and the story convinced me so far that I had to buy this DVD. And I didn't regret it because it is a real nail biter that took even my breath away until the end. Halle Berry was perfect in this so emotional mother role. Kidnap is one of the rare movies that is better than all other average or bad movies that came out this year. If you want to spend a suspense evening give this a chance. Together with my wife I give a solid 7/10. If you like this genre of films don't miss Trapped or Panic Room.",
         "How this movie received 6.4 stars is beyond me The trailer looked awesome, as usual they show you the good bits, Halle Berry's acting is really substandard, anyone in there right mind would not have acted in the same way she did. The car chase scenes are very disappointing, the director should have put a little more thought into the acting, car chases and story line. The movie left me feeling really frustrated with majority of her actions, the last time i felt this way was after watching Jeepers Creepers. Lets do all the wrong things for the sake of it to make an entertaining movie 1 star - utter garbage",
         "I think Halle Berry did great in Kidnap. The movie will have you on the edge of your seat and trust me there is never a dull moment. Plus the movie is not predictable so that's a plus! Don't Listen to all the kidnap haters and not watch the movie. I think you should watch the movie and judge for yourself whether it is a good movie or not. People have different opinions and you might actually like the movie. Just Give It A Chance!!!!!",
         "First of all, I saw Kidnap at a sneakpreview in The Netherlands. This means nobody knows which movie title they are going to see and you get a very diverse audience. The thing I noticed while filling out my rating form was that my form was the 9th one with a 1 filled in. Oké, the movie. It's bad most of the movie is a car chase at \"high\" speed :-) The car of the main character even gets overtaken by 2 trucks/lorries. The main character gets about a 1000 different possibilities to stop the car witth her son in it in front of others but never does. Somehow she does find it important to take off her sweater during the chase (if I would do that in that situation I would crash:) But enough about this movie, I want to forget I ever saw it. Be warned, stay away! Ps.. There is a reason why you don't hear allot about Halle Berry anymore.... (bad acting could be one)",
         "This is the worst recreation of a parents actions to a kidnapping. Her thoughtlessness got him kidnapped, there's no reason she faced the way she did. I had my kid at parks and playgrounds, but you can still keep an eye out. Sure kids can wander away, but this wasn't the case, it was all her. Then her bad pursuit got them to get away, there's reviews that stated she didn't stop the kidnapper car cause they showed her a (spoiler) knife!! She was right behind them on a slow moving ramp, she has a van pull in front of them and block them. The knife scene was much later. Don't she know how to use a van. Her frantic actions were understandable but the way she pulled it off was pathetic, the writing was really bad. People without common sense would enjoy this.",
         "This was so bad that I logged into IMDb to learn who was responsible for this rubbish posing as a movie. It was Luis Prieto and I will make very sure that I never bother with anything that he is associated with in the future. Beginning with the ludicrously over-long series of images of babies that bored me and imagine many others, it morphed into rambling and unnecessary nonsense that added nothing to the plot. I suffered through another thirty minutes or so hoping for improvement then turned the movie off in disgust. It lacks coherence, logic, a basic plot, and skill with imagery. BORING INANE BANAL are descriptors that jump to mind.",
         "I really loved this movie... every minute is thrill with a good story! You can relate to the characters. Halle's acting is again breathtaking. I really don't understand why some users have negative comments about this movie. I gave it 10 out of 10, because it does justice to its genre. Thriller movie lovers should definitely see it.",
         "You have to watch this movie if only for the car chase - which seems to take up at least two thirds of the screen time! This is kind of a comeback movie for Halle Berry, who hasn't really done very much in recent years. In \"Kidnap\" she plays Karla - a waitress who's involved in a custody dispute with her ex over their 6 year old son. After finishing work one day, Karla takes young Frankie to an amusement park, and he vanishes. Finally she catches a glimpse of him being forced into a green car - and the chase begins. And it's certainly a wild chase. Yes - wild to the point of unbelievable, but nevertheless a lot of fun to watch. The chase is wild and suspenseful and even frightening at times. It leads up to another pretty suspenseful encounter with the kidnappers at their home. Berry did pretty well with the part. To be honest, she's the only cast member of any real significance, so a bad performance from her would have made this unbearable. But she did well enough with the part. You know right from the start that little Frankie is going to be kidnapped, and there are a couple of points early in the movie that lead you to suspect one or another as responsible for the kidnapping. And, in the end, there's no way to predict the discovery Karla would make at the kidnappers' home. It's a pretty unbelievable film. The writing isn't all that great, but then again in a largely one person cast there's not a lot of dialogue necessary. The car chase and the scenes at the house are enough to keep you watching. I certainly wouldn't call this a great movie - but it's fast paced and entertaining and suspenseful. Well worth watching. (7/10)",
         "What does it take to make a good thriller? Suspense, to feel the tension, to give you the chills. And this movie did that in the right way! Don't get influenced by subjective people who walked of the movie after the first 10 minutes! If you love good flicks that give you goosebumps and mainly love thrillers, this is the perfect movie for you. Watching the trailer I was expecting mediocre movie, but what I got was way above that. It reminded me of another Halle Berry's thriller - The Call from 2013 which was very good too. I can't say it's a perfect film, it has it's flaws. There is only one \"what happened to that\" moment. You know, when some questions aren't answered, but it wasn't that big of a deal at all. Halle Berry's stellar and compelling performance definitely sells the character of a suffering mother trying to safe her kid's life. The other actors did pretty good job too. The film pushes the right buttons to make you feel the suspense in the whole run time. It surely deserves 10/10!",
         "Typical of an American movie where the most important emphasis is put on car chasing and people who have at least, like a cat, SEVEN lives. Come on!......please.... I fail to understand why Hale would accept playing in such a movie. She definitely has the talent to play in a much better and significant movie. Sorry!!!",
         "I don't understand why so many people disliked this movie, I thought it was an edge of your seat, intense film. I loved every minute of it. Sure the premise was not that original, but it was well acted and the scenes were acrion packed. Loved it!",
         "PROS: One thing is for sure, HALLE BERRE knows how to act. Movie after movie she delivers knock out performances. With all the you could point out being wrong she some how makes all the flaws fade away. You could see the true terror on her face, which game me true terror. Her ability to portray a natural fear gave me, the watcher, that same fear. That alone helped make the movie scary. With her feeling fear or anger made me and the film have fear or anger. That build up up intensity was rocket launched when the climax was taking place. The fight, that toughness, that the movie had towards the end really embodied what the whole film should've been. What the trailer showed us could best sum up the climax, which is what a horror trailer should sum up. CONS: Some big red flags are the ending. The ending spoiled every bit of creditability that the movie had established. It offered no climax to the film nor did it make sense. It added unneeded characters, it used unhelpful settings, and it was just super confusing. If you watch this movie you'll know what I mean when I say wtf. The other thing to add on is how unfathomable everything in this movie actually was. I understand car chase movies have to have a little bit of imagination involved, but what happened in the movie is just completely improbable. Time and time again I got mentally removed from the film because I was like no, this couldn't ever happen. That is the same with the finale, which just is so far fetched it is almost not even worth watching, because so much anticipation for a movie to get completely left for dead doesn't even make it worth worth it. www.chorror.com",
         "Here are the reasons why I think this movie is just a 5. 1. The film should've been shorter. 50mins would've been enough. 2. Too many unnecessary lines, it breaks the tension because it is funny/annoying. Like Carla always stating the obvious, or Carla reading out loud or the kidnapper telling where are his shotgun shells. 3. Where are the highway police? Where are the police in general? Are they so inept as to arrest the wrong person in the wrong van? (Ever heard of plate numbers?) 4. Why leave your child if you are just going to take a call? Take him with you. 5. If they were going to kill Carla anyway in the van why not take the knife and stab her? They don't need her since they are going to sell the kids anyway for 100K 6. A GT is a fast car. I'm pretty sure they could have lost her when she took a wrong exit or when they told her to take a different exit. With that said, the action/suspense scenes are great. You can feel the tension, Karla's desperation to get her son back.",
         "This movie is nothing short of amazing. Given the situation I would have done the same thing like a bat out of Hell. Halle Berry gave an emotional and real performance. There are no clichés and you never knew what was happening next. There really isn't much left too say but, EXCELLENT!",
         "Kidnap tells the story of Karla Dyson, who on a summer day the local park together with her son Frankie to blow of some steam and strengthen their mother-son bond. However disaster strikes when Frankie is kidnapped from under everyone's noses. Before all hope is lost Karla is able to catch a glimpse of a man and a women forcing Frankie into their car. The kidnappers quickly make their escape, however what they don't know is that they have chosen the wrong person to mess with as Karla wills top at nothing to recover her lost son. If this small synopsis got you excited please curb your enthusiasm as this pretty much describes the entire movie. Right from the start it is clear that the movie itself is as generic as the title would suggest. The first act is a very obvious attempt at establishing the mother- son bond such that we as an audience actually care about what happens to Frankie. This is executed so poorly however that it almost reaches an adverse effect and kind of makes you wish Frankie gets kidnapped. When this finally does happen the movie turns into a weird action movie that goes on for what feels like an eternity. When the movie finally reaches its conclusion it does so in an incredibly predicting manner and throughout the film there are no interesting twists to the story. Most of the action in the movie comes from a very long chase scene in the middle of the film. This sequence is however not very riveting since it is very obvious Karla will eventually catch up with the kidnappers because otherwise the movie would just end then and there. During these scenes the writers felt it necessary for Karla to spell out what is happening, often she would scream \"They've got my baby\" or \"My son is in that car\". It's about as stupid as it sounds and these are just a few examples. As much as Karla cares about her son as little does she seem to care about others, while chasing her kidnappers she causes many traffic accidents for instance when she is backing up on a highway where people are driving at 100 km/h. She must have caused the death or at the very least severe injury of many innocent people, however everyone seems to forget this when everyone calls her a 'true American hero' after she, spoiler warning, saves her son from the kidnappers. Kidnap is directed by Luis Prieto who makes a lot of weird creative decisions throughout. The chase sequences for instance are intercut with several aerial views of the two cars driving along the highway. These shots often go on for what feels like several minutes in what appears to be an attempt to pad the movies runtime. This was obviously necessary since the movie just barely exceeds Hollywood's' self- imposed 90 minute minimum, however it still manages to outstay it's welcome and bores halfway through. Furthermore Prieto never tries to make the movie visually interesting and hardly puts any focus on the emotional side of things as the only emotion Karla shows is anger, she never seems desperate or afraid. Halle Berry, the actress portraying Karla also hardly appear to put in any effort. Kidnap by far marks her worst performance of those I've seen and if this is representative of her future work then I really hope her role in the new Kingsman movie is limited to only a few scenes. However considering her multiple Golden Globes nominations and even an Academy Award win I really think that his terrible performance has more to do with the source material not giving her anything to really work with. Halle Berry for me is an actress that is best suited in the supporting category while in Kidnap she is on her own monologuing most of the time. Kidnap is by far the worst movie of the year up until now. The acting is terrible, the story is bland and predictable and nothing interesting is happening on the screen. I cannot recommend this movie to anyone, however if you really want to know the story of Karla and Frankie then watch the trailer instead and save yourself 90 costly minutes of your life. My rating: 1/10",
         "Halle's acting was superb, she really carried the intensity of the moment throughout. yes it should've been a little bit shorter but for this kind of movie I was entertained and on the edge of my seat for the most part. Oh and as someone who always forgets to charge my phone It didn't take suspension of belief for me to go along with how much trouble you can get into by not having a dang phone on you. I felt the morale of the film really is that you have to fight for your own, no one will care as much as you do.",
         "Truly shocking for people blindly following the words of critics. This is really a good film. I totally enjoyed it. Well, it was not like I never saw such film. In a century of motion picture history, hundreds of similar films were made. This is just another one, but there's nothing wrong with it. People wrongly judged it. The pace of the film was rocket speed. So basically, there's no time for one to keep looking for flaws. If they do, then they're not enjoying the show. They missed out everything, hence end up bashing it. Just like the clowns, aka film critics. It was another kidnap film that Halle Barry in it, that's similar to her previous film 'The Call'. It did not take long to get into the action. A hardworking mother, going through divorce, fighting for her son's custody. While engaging in a phone call, she loses her son in an amusement park. The alert mother quickly jumps into pursuing when he was seen forcefully taken in a stranger's car. The remaining events take place on the road, with car chases, with a twist before the conclusion. Nicely written screenplay and well performed actors, particularly Halle Berry. I have never seen she had played such an energetic role in the recent time. Whatever the storyline is, it's kind of an inspiring film. How a mother fought for her son. Totally a mother instinct. You can't simply expect like the film 'Taken'. It might not be realistic, but cinematically honest. The same thing happens in the animal world too. Sad that the film released after so many delays. Moreover, how people responded to it. Believe me, it is a nice film and I definitely suggest it to all. 8/10",
         "Halle was very convincing in this role! This movie was perfectly cast, written and directed. It was a thrill ride start to finish. It shows the natural instinctive protection a mother has for her young. I guess her ex-husband wont be demanding sole full custody any more! Bonus: A Caravan is a good van, but would be better if it had OnStar for those times you lose your phone :)"
