      "synopsis": "Jack (Billy Zane) and Jennifer (Kelly Brook) are a well-off married couple. He is a millionaire, and she is young and sexy. They share a private boat with some other friends like Maggie Richards (Isabelle Constantini), the wife of the captain of the ship, Captain Richards (Gary \"Tex\" Brockette). Brazilian young worker Manuel (Juan Pablo Di Pace) works at the ship. As the boat is leaving Manuel is seen striking a woman, presumably his girlfriend. Jack is accustomed to do as he pleases and thinks that his money will grant him every caprice in the world, which doesn't prevent him to feel jealous about his young wife. Jack is much older, and there is a feeling in his head that his wife may be with him because of his money. There is a fight between Manuel and Jack concerning Jennifer. Manuel quits his job on the boat after the conflict with Jack and throws a dish towel on a lit stove. This causes the boat to catch on fire and everyone to evacuate. There are only three survivors: the love triangle of Jack, Manuel and Jennifer in the middle. At first, Manuel and Jennifer think they are alone on the island and are having a hard time surviving without the ability to make fire. They go swimming together and Jennifer discovers that the woman Manuel struck was his girlfriend and he struck her because she claimed to be pregnant. Soon they find Jack in a pool and he has a lighter. Jack is constantly jealous of Manuel and Jennifer. The couple build a hut on the beach, - they consider the island jungle uninhabitable because of the swarms of mosquitoes - and Manuel builds his own hut next to them, but with clear limits between one home and the other. They worry constantly about getting food, the always-prowling sharks on the shore, the sharp reef, the keeping of the fire - Jack has got his own lighter, but they always have fear that it will extinguish. Manuel is younger and stronger. He tries to keep his distance with Jen, but it's difficult, as the island is not that big, although is big enough to have fresh water. Manuel is the main food provider: he climbs palm trees to get coconuts, he dives to fish... Jack seems unable to do those physical things, but it doesn't prevent him to keep from threatening Manuel to finish him off as soon as they leave the island. Manuel says that Jack's money is useless in the island, meanwhile Jack insists that he will boycott Manuel in their future lives post-island. Antagonism between Jack and Manuel escalate. Jack forbids Jen to eat the fish Manuel has caught, as from that moment on he wants to be the \"breadwinner\". Jen talks to Manuel nicely, so he offers her some fish. She doesn't tell Jack, but he finds it out. She defends herself, saying that she has stolen it from Manuel, in spite of which he isn't angry with her. Jack tries to fish even harder. One day, Jen and Manuel get caught in a fight, and they finally end up making love on the beach. Jack realises that, so he attacks Manuel. The Brazilian is stronger and Jen switch sides: she goes to Manuel's hut. Jack creates some goggles with parts of a plastic bottle. That way, he can rescue the sunk boat. Jen and Manuel run to him, but he doesn't want to share his recovery. Manuel and Jennifer plot to steal Jack's boat when he is distracted. Jack is eavesdropping while Jennifer and Manuel are making love in the water and they make up their plan. The next morning, Jack says that he's going to create a sail for the boat, and is going to fish before he leaves. Jen and Manuel run to get away in the boat, while Jack makes believe he's really angry, but sits to see what happens instead. When Manuel and Jen are two kilometres away, they realise that the boat has some missing parts, so water is going to flood it. They have to swim back all the way to the island. When they reach the island, Manuel is so tired that Jack can beat him up. Jack hits Manuel in the back with a spear though Manuel is eventually able to fight off Jack. Jen tries to stop them to no avail. She ends up tied to a pole where Jack threatens to rape her in front of Manuel. Manuel shows up and he and Jack fight which is enough time for Jen to escape. Jen and Manuel escape into the jungle. This separates the two groups even more: they steal each other's fish, they design traps for one another, and they hate each other more and more. Jack realises that there is a trap intending to kill him. At this point, the audience begins to see the images of a Manuel's pregnant girlfriend doing a voodoo ritual: she's setting a curse to Manuel. That's what helps Jack to realise about the trap. He sees Manuel and Jen who have climbed up to the top of a tree. He throws a spear and aims at Manuel. Manuel falls down. He tries to fight, despite Jennifer's attempts to reason with either of them. Manuel is weak from his wounds, his fall to the ground, and in the ensuing fight, Manuel is about to kill Jack while Jen holds him down but the voodoo woman makes Manuel fall over with her spell and he lands on a sharp stick, killing him. Jen hates Jack at this point, but she has to keep on living with him. A year or maybe more has passed since the three castaways reached the island. Jennifer is sleeping on her hut, when two children (Summer Davis & Keera Ann Davis) wake her up. They have gone to her hut in the beach attracted by the weird construction. The parents realise that she is a castaway and leave with her in their small boat. Jen takes the lighter with her. Jack is fishing, and she doesn't mention him to the family who has rescued her. She sees him swimming from the boat but doesn't call back to the captain. She is abandoning her husband for good. At first, on seeing the boat, Jack is overjoyed, but when he sees the boat living without him, the smile goes off his face.",

         "Went to see this tonight with my wife and we were surprised at a couple of things which I think are worth mentioning. The film itself was quite watchable but not terribly chilling. Kelly Brook has certainly come on since her days presenting the Big Breakfast that's for sure. Her acting isn't out of the Meryl Streep school but she managed to carry the role fairly convincingly. Billy Zane was actually excellent as the paranoid and obsessed arrogant husband and Juan Pablo Di Pace was also good as the young Brazilian (or Spanish) love rival. The main problem with the film is the script. It is seriously flawed mainly due to the fact that the whole thing is based on the idea of a voodoo curse which Juan Pablo's ex imposes on him. The whole voodoo thing is totally unnecessary and actually inhibits the film's attempt at desert-island realism. Without it the film would have been much better. A jealous husband and a sexy young Brazilian boat-hand eyeing up his wife is story enough. The small twist at the end is sort of predictable but a nice touch anyway. The film could have done with a few more such twists and thought. Our score of 5/10 is about as much as we could muster on a wet Monday evening. The locations and cinematography were exotic and the sexy scenes were, well sexy. Kelly is a lovely looking girl and my wife said Juan Pablo isn't bad either!",
         "How pointless, hideous characters and boring film. Saved by brief sex scenes, mad witch, gorgeous desert island and Brooks body. The plot is tenuous, the characters are shallow and unlikeable. Having said that I did manage to watch it all, mainly because I was totally transfixed by the jiggling and kind of hoping that her character would come good in the end. The film was well shot, well directed but perhaps the casting let it down in some ways. Disappointing. Really summed the review up in the first line but this website dictates that you need to write 10 lines minimum. It would be better to spend the time watching another film.",
         "A holiday on a boat, a married couple, an angry waiter and a shipwreck is the reason to this films beginning. I like boobs. No question about that. But when the main character allies with whoever happens to have the most fish at the moment, mostly by having sex with them and playing the role of the constant victim, my anger just rises to a whole new level. Take two guys (a husband and another man), put a pure bombshell woman in the middle of them, ad a deserted island, subtract all her moral issues, ad a whole bunch of moral issues to the men and mix it in a big bowl of arguments, fish and a zippo lighter and you will come up with a piece of junk movie like this. The acting is, I would say, good. There are some bloopers but not many as far as i could see. The main female character makes me sick. This is due to her lack of moral values. The man with the most fish get's her attention. Even though one of them is her husband, she sees no problem with being unfaithful with (Manuel) the other man because \"I must do it to survive\". How can you justify having sex with another man for fish when your husband is 30feet away? And he won't even benefit from it? The female character has absolutely no problems to justify anything that she does. If she doesen't get approval for her actions, she's a victim. I recommend everyone to see this movie. This is the kind of movie that will make just about everything else you see this year a pleasant movie experience.",
         "THREE is a low budget sexy thriller. Its a late night movie that you can watch with your girlfriend (or alone), not the kind of movie you take everyone to a theater and watch. Kelly brook covers sex part GREATLY where as the thriller part is kind of \"blah\". Then again if you rented the movie for the thrill joke is on you. Saw a lot of bad reviews of the movie. I don't know what the heck people were expecting out of it. I saw the trailer of the movie and knew exactly what it was going to be. So I rented the movie without much expectation and i was satisfied. Go rent the movie, you are going to watch it, enjoy it and then forget about it. If you want thriller go rent Usual suspects, this movie is not for you.",
         "I can only assume the previous posts came from execs at the production company... Attended the UK premiere last night. Zane and Brook attended (they probably knew I was gonna be there) and are undoubtedly stars, but what a turkey of a film. I felt sorry for them at times, when the audience erupted in laughter at what were serious 'thriller' scenes. But perhaps I was missing the point. Perhaps an element of tongue-in-cheek was intended. If so, pure genius. If not, career genocide. On the plus side, Zane always shines, and Brook can actually act a little. As the other half said (as we ran out the cinema, avec broken ribs), they can be forgiven for this film as they both seem like nice people! The scriptwriter, however, should be marooned.",
         "... how many people rented this movie just to see Kelly Brook's boobies? I did, and am not ashamed to admit it... well, much. Anyway, there's about three minutes max of boobies in the film's 90 minute runtime, albeit a lot of bikini shots throughout. Sure, it's shallow to view a film like that, but no one is really going to watch Three as an adult thriller, are they? With so-so acting, quite poor editing/continuity and a pointless voodoo subtext, this film rarely drags and is watchable throughout, albeit never particularly any good. I've seen plenty worse (for the genre, then \"Swept Away\", aka Ritchie's Folly springs to mind) and the characters are reasonably developed. Occasionally the script is trite, and you can't help but feel a little sympathetic for Jack (Billy Zane, Brook's real-life boyfriend) and the way he's been treated. Maybe it's Zane's vague likability in a boorish role that enables him to not become the villain he's meant to be. But we watched it for the boobies, right?",
         "The very reason I watched this film due to the reason that there was a super hot chick on the cover of the DVD which is Kelly Brooke. I didn't exactly sit through every single minute of it. the story was boring. The ending was bad. What was with the voodoo thing? There was a major goof during the first time, Kelly striped to bath in the sea water. She striped completely (top and bottom) and yet when she came back on shore, she was wearing her bikini bottom and was only topless. Needless to say, that was the high side of the film most guys will be watching. Other than that... there was the sex scene which was quite interesting. Other than that, most of the time, I was ogling at Kelly in her white bikini.",
         "Wow! This movie is fantastic! The surface is all straight-to-video B-movie \"Wild things\"-wannabe \"watch-it-once-then-forget-for-good\", but under the surface lies both a clever satire on, AND a perfect study of, human nature. Paul Verhoeven should love this movie! Three people wash ashore of a deserted island: we got your basic WASP (the always underrated Zane), his trophy wife (the beautiful Brook) and your basic mcjob cabana boy. Without a link to 'the world', things start to go \"lord of the flies\": in isolation, where your knowledge, money and social status mean nothing and you are measured by your primal abilities - hunt for food, build a shelter - the woman truly becomes a trophy as the cabana boy finally has his day, being supreme to the so-called \"educated man\". Now I believe some people would call this movie thin and questionize the main trio's actions and reactions. Well for those sore comments I say, open your eyes. If you want proof, watch 2 episodes of \"Big brother\". The darker side of humanity is back-stabbing, oversexed, lying, cheating, provocative... and violent. As a disclosure, let me sum up the characters for you. The cabana boy = the player. All us guys know he's the type who doesn't give a damn for women's mind but fakes it damn well (proof: if there were other women on the Island, he wouldn't rest until he'd slept with all of them). Around this self-indulgent male women lose control of themselves and fall for his brown eyes, even WHEN he turns out to be very persistent on the sex business (respect, yeah)... and even though he said she could decide what happens between them (yea, right). Women still fall for this... His motto: \"Don't think about him, he doesn't deserve you. Let's dance\" The woman = the trophy. Does she control the situation or vice versa? Beats me. All I can say is, whatever she told her husband on the aisle turns out to mean squat when there's either a more providable alpha male (or a puppy-eyed cabana boy) around. Her mottoes: \"Can't we just forget this ever happened?\" or \"It was your fault!\" The WASP = turns out to be the bad guy, (again). Yep, no sympathy for the white collar. Even though he's a hard-working and loving husband. He sees the cabana boy making moves on his wife - a situation NOT helped by the fact that his wife tries to deny it - so he does what he'd do in the world also when there's competition, he works double time. To provide shelter and food for his wife. Who just can not be thankful for his self-sacrifice. Ironically, this way he's away from \"home\" more AND stressful when he comes back, with his mind full of doubts from the time he was away! So he's kind of \"pushing his wife\" away, patting the way for the cabana boy. Wonderful metaphor of today's competitive lifestyle, alienated, unthankful housewifes and opportunist cabana boys! \"Three\" - racist, pessimistic and extreme... or clever and VERY observant. PS. Why the totally unnecessary Voodoo-mumbo-jumbo side plot?",
         "The best things in life are 'Three' (if you'll forgive the pun), or so the text on the back of the DVD box would have us believe. 'Three' is described as a steamy erotic thriller guaranteed to create an atmosphere so tense you can barely swallow for fear whilst at the same time it is full of hot performances with lavish sexual tension on the screen. This is what we are led to believe by the studio. Alas, like so many promises in life I fear these comments are a well intentioned attempt to try and hide the truth of the matter. And the truth of the matter is really very simple. The truth is printed on the front cover of the DVD where the crafty devils at the studio placed a rather attractive picture of the lead lady on the front cover of the DVD along with the words \"Kelly finally exposes all.\" This, I believe, is a far better description of the true merits of the movie. If like me, you rented this film because you heard on the grapevine that Kelly Brook was actually filmed in the buff then I feel you represent the vast majority of aficionados of this rather delightful film, and let's be honest the storyline is ropey as hell, and the acting poor, and the characters are dislikeable. But does this matter? Not a jot. The film moves along at a fair pace, the location is fabulous and Kelly Brook is stunning. And to be honest it is a very big plus of this film that not once did I feel the need to fast forward to the more juicy scenes where Ms Brook really comes into her own as the lead lady. To try and wrap this film up as a thriller was unnecessary and really detracted from the film itself . We all know the real reason why anybody would rent this film, and to this end the movie does its job perfectly. All in all this film was not great, but hey, we all know what we wanted �and we got it. Can you really ask for anything more?",
         "The story started out well by quickly going into action where we see two couples, including Billy Zane and Kelly Brook, chartering a boat in some area like in the Caribbean. One of the boat crew is played by Di Pace who gets into a quarrel with his girlfriend on the dock. Well, things don't go well after that because the girlfriend puts a curse on him. They are now out on the ocean and there is an accident and one of the couple and Di Pace are the only survivors stranded on a tiny island with no way out. Tension begin to arise because of an attraction that is brewing between Pace and Brook. In the background, the ex-girlfriend is influencing the dynamics among the three individuals by using her voodoo powers. It all ends up with a final showdown between the parties I liked the premise of the story. It had good acting. Billy Zane is always a solid performer, albeit little bit over the top. Kelly Brook and Di Pace, both unknown to me did their part well. My problem with this movie is that the director or the person who wrote the script, seemed unsure whether this movie should be a supernatural story or a thriller. I suppose the movie can be both but if that was the case, the movie was not well executed for that purpose. I also had problem with Billy Zane's character in that we don't know whether his behavior is influenced by voodoo or whether it was innate within him. As you can see, the script should have been rewritten to flesh out those important details. Overall, a decent movie. I was going to give it a 4 but I am instead, going to give it a 5. In retrospect, it is not a bad movie. It is OK as a video movie but nothing else."
