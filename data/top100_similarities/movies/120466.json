         "content": "> Its a sci-fi age and robot rules.\r\n\r\nIt came as a little surprise. Obviously I was looking for this film, but not expected to reach at this level. The film was really brilliant despite the influence of plenty of other films. Yes, the ideas were borrowed from the movies like 'Short Circuit', 'I, Robot', 'RoboCop', Real Steel', \"Bicentennial Man', 'Transcendence', et cetera. But that did not bother me at all. I would call it an inspiration to make a new product out that already existed.\r\n\r\nIt was not completely depended on Dev Patel's role, otherwise woulda been a disaster. Its the Hugh Jackman, eventhough his character was not on the frontline, because of his presence, the movie was filled with some exciting and thrilling moment. His role was pretty much same to 'Real Steal', but showed in a different shade.\r\n\r\nSilly concept, even dialogues were so stupid. I don't know, maybe because of the South African accent. But the screenplay was very good. Fast and gets the point quickly than wasting time for buildups. One of the best robot movie and it will be remembered. Looks like the sequel will be more furious and going to be an action packed item, if there will be one. Worth to watch it at least once.\r\n\r\n7.5/10",

      "synopsis": "Set in an undeterminate year of the near future in South Africa, Johannesburg is the first city to use a robot police force. Created by Deon Wilson (Dev Patel) these robots are completely automated and have artificial intelligence. Deons office rival Vincent Moore (Hugh Jackman) has created The Moose (basically ED-209 from Robocop), which is operated via a human. Moore isn't a big fan of Deon's work. Robocop unit 22 is back in the shop again. It seems this particular unit is accident prone and always getting serviced. The techs get it back into action and send it out into the field where it assists in a police raid on a drug deal gone bad. On one side of the drug deal are Die Antwoords Ninja and Yolandi playing characters named Ninja and Yolandi. They're teamed with Amerika (Jose Pablo Cantillo). They're trying to deliver goods to crime boss Hippo (Brandon Auret). Ninja, Yolandi and Amerika manage to escape during the police raid. Hippo shoots a rocket launcher into 22s chest and also manages to evade the cops. Back at the shop, the techs see that 22s battery is fused with his chest piece, so hes basically beyond repair. They set him aside to be scrapped. Hippo calls the gang and tells them that hes not in jail and he still expects them to pay him the money they owe him from their previous botched job. Moore asks robo-boss Michelle Bradley (Sigourney Weaver) for more money to assist with further developing his Moose. Deon's robocops are such a hit that the government has decided to sink more money into that project and has no interest in the Moose. Its big, expensive and ugly. Deon goes home and starts working on his newest project which is creating an artificial consciousness. After a long night of programming and Red Bull, he succeeds. Yolandi has a plan that the robocops must be like a television so all they need is a remote control to turn them off. They look at the news and see that Deon is the dude who created the robocops, so he must be the guy who knows how to power them down. Deon asks Bradley if he can use his artificial consciousness program on the scrapped 22 unit. He explains that its possible that this could create a robot smarter than humans and it could even conceivably write poetry. She explains that they're in the business of defense and not in the business of creating poets, so she gives him the big old thumbs down. Deon decides to take a chance, gets the scrapped 22 and the Guard Key, which is needed to update the programming in all the robots as a precaution against hackers, and smuggles them out of the factory. The gang kidnaps him before he can get home. The gang takes Deon back to their base and ask him how to shut down the robocops. He says its impossible. They're about to kill him, but discover the 22 unit in the back of his van. He assembles it for them, explaining that if his program works, it can be taught. He puts it together and the 22 has the personality of a scared child. Yolandi takes on an immediate mother-role and tells him that he's a happy chappie and names him Chappie. They let Deon leave, but he asks to come back to check on the progress. He also tells them that because of the fused battery, Chappie only has about five days to live. Moore wants to work on his Moose, but discovers that the Guard Key is missing. He knows Deon took it. The next day Yolandi and Amerika start teaching Chappie. Ninja gets mad that because he needs Chappie trained to help them to do one more heist so they can pay back Hippo. At work, Moore pulls his gun on Deon, but plays it off as a joke. Hes seriously got a screw loose. Deon leaves work to check on Chappie. Hes mad that the gang is turning him into a thug, so he asks Chappie to promise not to do anything illegal. Moore follows Deon and sees whats going on. Ninja returns and threatens to kill Deon again for interfering with his plans. He and Amerika take Chappie to the middle of a rough area and leave him there. The locals start attacking him, but because Chappie promised Deon he wouldn't do anything bad, he doesn't fight back. Chappie makes his way back to the gang hideout where Amerika and Yolandi fix him back up. Ninja and Amerika figure out a way to trick Chappie into helping them. Together, they steal cars so they can get money to get weapons so they can do their big heist. Once they have enough cars, they go to a crazy looking apartment building, not completely unlike the building in Dredd. When they get there, a dog fight is taking place. Chappie cant go up to see the arms dealer Pitbull (Johnny Selema) and get weapons, and a stack of Playstation 4's. When they return, Chappie is trying to nurse a dead dog back to health. Ninja explains to him that in life you can either end up the dead dog, or the winning dog which. He also tells him that his battery cant be fixed because Deon made him to die. But if he helps them with their heist, they'll be able to buy him a new body. Chappie goes along with the idea because he doesn't want to die. Deon returns to the gang hideout and is disappointed that Chappie is out doing illegal stuff with Ninja and Amerika. Yolandi tells him that he should leave because Ninja will kill him if he finds him there. Chappie, Ninja and Amerika return. Deon tries to reason with Chappie, but Chappie tells him that hes angry that Deon didn't tell him that he was going to die. News stories break that Chappie is out in the world committing crimes, so Moore hunts him down. He manages to capture Chappie and steal the Guard Key from his head. Moore uses the guard key to shut down all of the robocops. Time breaks out all over Johannesburg. Deon finds the Key in Moore's computer and manages to turn back on Chappie. Before they escape, Chappie sees The Moose. Deon explains that its controlled by transferring a human operators consciousness via a control helmet. Chappie steals the helmet and they go back to the gang hideout. At the gang hideout, Chappie rigs up Yolandi's laptop and all the PS4s to create a super computer. He tests the helmet out on Yolandi and it works! The gang goes to meet with Hippo, who has changed the deal. He now wants Chappie for himself. Moore sends The Moose in on the deal too. A three way fire fight breaks out. The Moose steps on Amerika and rips him in half. Hippo is killed. Deon gets shot. Ninja creates a diversion so Deon, Yolandi and Chappie can escape. The Moose is about to take out Ninja, but Yolandi surprises it by launching a rocket at it. It turns and shoots Yolandi dead. Chappie jumps back into the action and blows up The Moose. Chappie rushes Deon back to the lab. Moore is still there. Chappie beats him into a mangled mess, but doesn't kill him. Deon is seconds away from death, but Chappie puts his consciousness in the one test robot that's available. Deon, now a robot figures out a way to save Chappie too. He sends Chappies consciousness into the nearest fallen Robocop. That works too. So Deon and Chappie are robots now. Chappie has Yolandi's consciousness saved on a thumb drive from earlier when he was testing out the helmet. He hacks into the robot factory and has it create a new schematic. Yolandis consciousness is transferred into a brand new Fembot. And they all lived happily ever after....... as robots.",

         "I thoroughly enjoyed Chappie. I usually don't write reviews, but after seeing the brutal rating this movie is getting I felt compelled to write this review. Chappie is a funny, entertaining, and surprisingly sentimental movie about a sentient robot being raised by gangsters in Johannesburg. Most of the criticisms I've seen about one- dimensional characters and illogical character choices are valid, but Chappie's character, the CGI, the humor, and the overall aesthetic of the movie more than make up for these shortcomings. Please go see this movie and make up your own mind. I almost didn't go last night because of the negative reviews, but I'm so happy I did. I'm very excited to see this movie again. You leave this movie feeling like you've become friends with Chappie, and I hope the bad reviews don't prevent the sequels from being made. If you like Neill Blomkamp's directing and style you will love this movie.",
         "Don't let the critics who can't seem to get past comparing Chappie with other sci-fi titles put you off of going to see this film. This story is about a lot more than just robot police officers it is a thought provoking social commentary on many modern day issues and what it is like to bring life into the modern world. I very much enjoyed District 9 but I would even go as far to say I enjoyed Chappie much, much more. There were so many aspects to this film that could have went wrong but have been nailed on the head by the director. The effect once again visually striking and a very well paced and intricate development of characters as well as interesting set design helps keep chappie fresh and not just another reboot of any other sci fi film as critics will have you believe. I would also say I enjoyed this film much, much more than the likes of robo-cop.",
         "This is not just an excellent and entertaining movie, i found many elements as real/istic and present, it is just touched some (maybe) future elements. Neil pulled the maximum out of this story and made it unforgettable as District 9 was. How ever, my stomach turns upside down when i see the Metacritic or Rotten Tomatoes score, these pathetic sites and their brainless people (called themselves \"critics\") live amongst us with their nonsense and empty headed, braintumored criticism - sure, this movie has no Beverly Hills and it's \"amazing\" crowd, no lemonade punch as story, no muscle cars and no muscle people, no worldwide threat to the USA and such. It has something else to say and this is the core of this amazing movie. Afterall, Chappie has Everything that needs for a unique and must-see movie, sure, it is a target for all those (disgusting) critics who expect the everyday boring lemonade with everyday boring actors and actress. Shame on Metacritic and Rotten Tomatoes, you guys are not more, than just rotten and brainless second level scribblers.",
         "Felt like leaving the theater for this one. It started off nicely, with a hugely successful robot task force with moderate A.I. Then for some reason funding gets cut and the head developer decides to go rogue and install his untested super A.I. on a stolen robot. Hard to swallow plot #1: The robots can only be reprogrammed in the presence of a unique key USB disk. The developer just picks it up and takes it home, spends several days with it, and no one bats an eye. #2: Chappie is born with the knowledge of a baby. But miraculously he learns the English language in a couple of days of exchanging a few sentences with his \"parents\". #3: The bad guys let the developer, which they just stole and beat the crap of, come and go as he pleases. No worries of him alerting the authorities or his companies' own robot army. Which he doesn't, inexplicably. #4: For someone so intelligent, Chappie is pretty dumb. He knows shooting someone kills them but is convinced that knifing \"just makes them sleep\". #5: After lying to manipulate the robot every step of the way, the \"bad daddy\" decides to come clean and admit that in fact he can't prevent Chappie's demise. Which obviously results in almost getting killed. #6: The same \"bad daddy\" then does a complete flip flop and puts his life on the line to save Chappie. Which is going to die in a few hours anyway. And not in any effective way I might add, he just decides to become a sitting duck for some reason. #7: The factory where all the mayhem originated from is the least secure place in the city. And absolutely no one, except for the protagonist and the antagonist, are able to go to the command console and sort things out. In fact it just remains abandoned in all other times. #8: The childlike robot prodigy miraculously (again) is able to do a feat no else had: transfer consciousness. With some banged up laptop too. #9: Police is nowhere to be seen, and despite being perfectly possible to restore the malfunctioning robots from the control central no one decides to even try it. There's just frantic panic and cowboy stunts. There's more but you get the picture. To me the movie was painful to watch. Every character seemed to be shouting all the time and have complete disregard for logic. It was a dumb movie. The one nice thing that temporarily took the pain away was the warm feeling you get when you realize the robot is able to sacrifice his own life for the survival of a human. So, 2 minutes out of 120. Maybe I should have rated this even lower - but the 3/10 stands, because of visuals.",
         "Why all the hate for this movie? I understand not liking something, but everyone seems to just TRASH it. Did I see the same movie? I saw an emotional film about innocence and loss. I REALLY don't understand. Sure, maybe the film didn't have the best dialogue or the best acting in the world, but it hit home for me. The VFX were phenomenal, Chappie is the best CGI motion capture I have seen in a long time, the 100% electronic musical score by Hans Zimmer was really unique and fresh, and it has a really great ending. I DON'T UNDERSTAND. If you like Blomkamp's previous films or are remotely interested, please watch it yourself. I think the critics are wrong on this one. I have been thinking for a while about why the reviews are so out there. First off, the trailers are AWFUL. The first to come out was this philosophical \"What does it mean to be human?\" kinda movie. The TV trailers were \"GUNS, EXPLOSIONS, ROBOTS!!!\" and it is neither. Think \"Little Miss Sunshine\" with a robot, that is a more accurate representation. Blomkamp's most underrated film.",
         "This is a great movie definitely in the style of Niell Blomkamp. However, some people might consider this a fault, as Elysium was a little off the mark. What is great about the movie is its style. They really went all out with Yolandi and Ninja (the main characters part of the musical group Die Antwoord). Hugh Jackman is pretty hilarious as a bloodthirsty war vet, selling his role pretty well. The technology in this movie is fantastic, as usual coming from Blomkamp, leaving plenty of ideas for the imagination to wonder about for the future. Of course, Chappie really makes this movie; taking something so technical and robotic, making it human in action. He really gets the feels going. I haven't laughed like that in a movie theater in a long time. Add to that the oddness of the characters influencing the development of Chappie, this movie is gangster. Still, 9/10, super great movie.",
         "I went to watch it because I like scifi and AI/robot theme TV/movies in general. Some I hate (Her, A.I.) some I love (Blade Runner, Battlestar remake, Wall-E). This one, I love. I didn't have an opinion about Neill Blomkamp. Didn't even know Hugh Jackman is in this movie so it was a pleasant surprise. I was emotionally moved and entertained. Chappie is one of - no, THE MOST action-packed YET emotionally-engaging and HEARTFUL movies I've watched in a while, no bored moments and no time for going into meta-analysis. Can't believe I cared about a clunky metalic wire-ly robot, haven't since the far-cuter Wall-E anyway. Dev Pattel is well cast, did the role total justice. Sigourney did her part with just the right note. Hugh succeeded in compressing his bigger-than-life self into an unglamorous (even unflattering) thug-in-cubicle-job role. Very noble of him, lending his superstar weight to this project. (showing Mr.BirdMan how a real-life hero gracefully bow out of superhero phase of his film role) In spite of the tension from start to end, people burst out laughing A LOT throughout. There were lots of humor, but nothing contrived, just Grade AAA seamless storytelling. And if the key characters act crazy, it is explained why, without being captain obvious. Dialogs and expositions, 99% SHOW vs tell, Mckee would be proud, not that it mattered against the hateful bigots of pro critics Borg contingent. I decided somewhere along 20 minutes in - I REALLY like this directorial voice. The technical bits: the story craft, the plotting, pacing, editing, art directing, effects, all superb and SEAMLESSLY EXECUTED. Zero complaint there. My only beef is as usual the theological stuff but I will not trash something this brilliant because it doesn't agree with my spiritual viewpoint. Side note on IRRELEVANCY OF RT CRITIC SCORE (and probably Academy Self-Awards) I never cared about Rotten Tomatos score but my other half love to check it after every movie. We both anticipated the critics will be hateful with this one because it features a non-American director and 2 non-American male leads! But we didn't expect the shamelessness level. At least the audience disagreed by a HUGE margin, and the audience WORLDWIDE will continue to disagree as the box office telly of Rest of The World come in. This movie is trashed due to PURE POLITICAL reason. DUH. There are some really tightly-wound-up, bitter ANALysts in the mainstream \"art\" critic scene, who have forgotten how to feel sentient, and lost touch with everything, obviously. Anyway, go watch it, just for entertainment. If you happen to be moved then it is a bonus. It will prove that you have a heart, and more sentient than the average Borgs who's tied into \"networked group mind\" opinions. Meanwhile I totally look forward to a sequel. 9/10. +1 just to annoy the art-haters.",
         "I liked District 9 and Elysium, so I was really looking forward to Chappie, especially for the special effects that I'd seen in those previous films. I felt like Chappie needed to be at least another hour longer to convey the director's message properly. There are way too many holes in the story to lead to such a thought-provoking ending. I'll say there was sufficient delivery on the special effects, but the story was not extensive enough. One - there's no explanation as to why \"Ninja\" and his mates owe some master criminal millions of dollars; two - one minute Chappie's being bullied by thugs and the next we're to expect they're loving foster parents; and three - why would transferring one's \"consciousness\" to another being also carry their voice and accent over? I expect a movie to suspend my beliefs for a couple of hours, but a story that flows well makes for $ better spent.",
         "I believe this movie only solidifies my concrete statement that 21st century is an age of pointless cinema. Most of the plot in Chappie either fails to follow common human logic, or completely breaks it. This is a modern trend of over- dramatizing the events by making \"shit happen\" in the literal meaning of this phrase. It all starts in a not-too distant future with an international corporation, based in SAR, which solved the problem of rising crime wave by introducing almost all-robotic police force. Then few things just happen: - The lead researcher makes a breakthrough in AI development and asks company CEO to give him a broken robot for experiments. She \"politely\" refuses and desperate doc risks his impressive paycheck and reputation by stealing this piece of junk off the scrapyard. - The rival former-military engineer fails to sell his combat machine (which for some reason looks like robot-chicken from robocop) and after another budget cut risks his not-so-impressive paycheck, but more solid reputation as pioneer in neural interfaces, to sabotage the whole \"scout\" operation and start a nationwide crime spree - A local gang with looks of early 90s inspired cyberpunk movies get into conflict situation with another dude. In order to solve this problem they need to find 20.000.000 moneys, so the only logical solution is to find a robot-maker and get a hypothetical OFF-switch, so it will be easier to do whatever crimes they've planned with their pumpkin heads. They bust the doctor, while he was driving a van with a stolen robot. After successful installation of new software they get a semi-intelligent gansta-ninja robot filled with curiosity, deep understanding of neural interfaces and human consciousness, but lacking the basic knowledge of trauma, pain and death (even with internet connection). The end result: all robots are broken, everyone is dead. After lots of shooting and the final boss battle Chappie revives the doctor and his mama as robots. Credits start rolling, so are my strained eyes... Gave it 3/10 for visuals. Everything else sucks. All the aspects of the movie that fans claim to be unique and innovative have been meticulously copied from many other(even recent) sci-fi titles with no sign of shame or remorse.",
         "Chappie is an interesting film because it could be ridiculed for random themes and inconsistent story, or it could be praised for the fact that it brings up a lot of ambitious ideas and concepts. It is a really interesting film as far as themes go. The movie brings up a lot of ideas that aren't brought up in most \"AI\" films such as: Does the robot recognize his own mortality? Does the robot feel guilt? How does the robot react to having one parent being a criminal and the other parent being a respectful scientist? There were a lot of scenes where I was thinking \"Dang, this could lead to a pretty cool concept\". Unfortunately, the movie never fleshes out any of its themes. It is always very sad to see a movie like this: A movie that has all the right elements to be good, but it gets too distracted in being too many things so it never gets any of the elements right. For example, one of the ingenious themes is the fact that Chappie has two parents: A scientist and a very violent thug. On one side Chappie is learning about the basics of language and how to be a model citizen, but on the other side he is learning how to properly mug people, how to fight, how to talk cool, how to walk cool, and how to earn respect from other people. This is very interesting because the movie never starts Chappie out as super intelligent, it starts him out as a very quick learning child. This means you can see him slowly learn and make connections between every event in his life. A great example of this is Chappie is told that knives make people go to sleep, so naturally Chappie tries to stab people until he is told that they don't want to go to sleep. However, when Chappie starts stabbing people later, you see him pause and looks into someone's eyes and say \"I'm sorry, I didn't know. Don't go to sleep\". But he says it very quietly so that no one else can hear. These are some very deep and interesting themes and Chappie is a very interesting character. Unfortunately, it never fleshes out its themes. This means a lot of very profound themes will fly by in about five minutes and not show up later. This also brings us to one hilarious big issue with the movie: Every scene involving the villain makes little to no sense. It's not that I don't mind Hugh Jackman, or the approach they were taking, it was how insane and over the top he becomes. He is supposed to be playing a local engineer/scientist who wants to make human controlled mechs that are grossly over-powered for the job of law enforcement. Instead of modifying his idea and making it work for the job, he still says that law-enforcement needs a mech with... mini-guns, claws, machine guns, rockets, cluster missiles, and just about anything you can think of. It really makes no sense to want that on the street. This brings up several questions: Why not just sell it to the military? He does work for a weapons company so if not law enforcement why not military (He was hinted at being an ex- solider/Veteran). So his obsession doesn't really make sense: If he really wants human controlled machines, then make one less overpowered. If he really wants an overpowered mech, then sell it to the military. However, because he doesn't do either of these, he becomes an insane psychopath who literally shuts down all of the security/robots in the city just to prove that they need heavier firepower for the job. This brings up a lot of plot-holes: How was he able to do this so easily? Any company (even your local cable company) can track a computer that is shutting down other equipment. How did no one notice him doing this? Why didn't the protagonist tell anyone else that he was doing this? How was he able to gruesomely kill fairly innocent people, while laughing, and no one in the office space took notice? This element of the movie truly absurd and doesn't even fit into the plot. He really is a shoe-horned villain. Just about anyone else could've been the villain and it would've made more sense. Why not the ring-leader from the beginning? He said he wanted to shut- down all of the robots? Several other people were looking for a remote to shutdown all of the robots, so literally anyone could've been the villain and would've had better motives than Hugh Jackman. Other than that, the ending is a bit random, but I was okay with it until the last minute or so. The very very end is kind of... okay? That doesn't make sense with the universe's set rules, but... okay... Fortunately, the other characters in this movie are pretty good. Some people may find them annoying, but I found it interesting because its not like Chappie fell into the hands of perfect people who knew how to use him, Chappie fell into the hands of people who have no idea how robots work or the science behind them. So certain people attach to him differently. Some people treat him like a human, while others do not. All in all, a smarter than your average film, but full of plot-holes and issues. Kind of sad, really."

         "In Johannesburg, the police department reduced the high rating of criminality using robots from the Tetravaal Company, designed by the engineer Deon Wilson. The former military Vincent Moore is envious of Deon, since he has developed another project called Moose, but neither Tetravaal nor the police department is interested. Deon has just developed an Artificial Intelligence but the Tetravaal's CEO Michelle Bradley asks him to abort the project. Deon decides to bring the damaged Robot 22 that was sent to be crushed to test his A.I. However he is kidnapped by the criminals Ninja, Yo-Landi and Amerika that want him to stop the robot cops. When they see the damaged robot in the van, they force Deon to program it to heist banks with them and they call it Chappie. However, Chappie acts like a child and need to be trained to learn and grow. Meanwhile Vincent follows Deon and plots an evil scheme to activate his robot.",
